[00:00] <pleia2> anyway, I hope it'll be easier for you since you have an in, already being part of the district and all :)
[00:02] <roasted> absolutely
[00:03] <roasted> last year my boss retired a few systems. after a board meeting/approval they were given to me. Ubuntu + XFCE later they found a new purpose in life and soon enough new homes
[00:03] <roasted> my spin on it is taking THAT idea + personal teacher-owned systems and spinning it on a higher frequency
[00:03] <roasted> I think it would be far, far easier, since I have no board to answer to with personal gear :D
[00:04] <roasted> I have an old (pentium 3?) system downstairs that I'm oging to puta headless OS on... I'll use that to dd a pre-built Ubuntu + LXDE image onto each drive via my USB adapter
[00:05] <roasted> only thing is, I'm going to build the image ona 10GB partition. I just need to figure out how to blow that partition up to expand across the entire HDD, whether it's 60GB or 1TB. Should be easy enough but that's the last bit of the configuration process I need to do
[00:09] <pleia2> the projects jedijf worked on did a lot of imaging
[00:09]  * waltman 's ears perked up, but then I realized you were talking about *that* kind of imaging :(
[00:10] <roasted> I've done a truckload of imaging... I set up a FOG box at another district I used to work at toimage all of their Windows ysstems.
[00:10] <roasted> Did about 4-5,000 in my time there.
[00:10] <waltman> It's been a long week.
[00:10] <roasted> I hear ya waltman
[00:10] <roasted> I'm on the deck with a cigar listening to a little pink floyd.
[00:10] <roasted> all I need is a cold one.. but dangit that means getting up...
[00:10] <waltman> phl.pm Monday night. Sat in on $boss's class Wednesday night. AI Winter Thursday night.
[00:11] <roasted> annnnd there's that solo... audio perfection.
[00:11] <waltman> I don't partake, but doesn't brandy go better with cigars than beer?
[00:11] <roasted> could very well be. I don't recall ever having brandy...
[00:12] <roasted> I do have a magnitude of leftover liquor from my wedding two months ago :X
[00:12] <waltman> You really want something you can sip slowly while contemplating existence.
[00:12] <roasted> dangit you just might entice me to get up
[00:12] <pleia2> roasted: congrats :)
[00:12] <roasted> STOP IT
[00:12] <roasted> pleia2: want to know a fun fact about that wedding?
[00:13] <pleia2> sure!
[00:13] <waltman> I suppose any sort of whiskey or bourbon would work
[00:13] <roasted> I rented a DJ system for 100 bucks and DJed it myself using my Ubuntu rig with Clementine and some pre-defined playlists.
[00:13] <pleia2> (I'm in the middle of we-should-just-elope wedding planning myself)
[00:13] <pleia2> hehe, neat
[00:13] <roasted> I had my brothers (who played acoustic guitar and harmonica during the ceremony) kick it off during the introduction. After that, it just... ran...
[00:13] <roasted> I switched it from dinner to dance playlists, besides that, it was perfection.
[00:14] <roasted> When's the date pleia2 ?
[00:14] <waltman> pleia2: I think what roasted is saying is that you should hire roasted to dj your wedding. :)
[00:14] <pleia2> april 28th
[00:14] <roasted> hahahhaa, it could be arranged!
[00:14] <pleia2> lol
[00:15] <waltman> or at least roasted's rig
[00:15] <roasted> It took a magnitude of work, because I put a truckload of thought into all of the music and setting up the playlist.
[00:15] <roasted> But it surprised me just how perfect it turned out.
[00:15] <roasted> I think the only goof was when my wife yelled TIME FOR DANCE MUSIC and I put on comfortably numb. :X
[00:15] <roasted> I had to rectify that a few seconds into the song but, hey, it happens. :D
[00:15] <pleia2> MC abilities are actually important for ours, I have no idea what's going on :) someone needs to tell me when it's time to do the horah and eat cake
[00:16] <roasted> I hear ya. That was our concern as well.
[00:16] <pleia2> (enlisted cousins to actually teach us how to do the horah, must...not...panic...)
[00:16] <roasted> We had a microphone with ours.
[00:16] <roasted> I rented the DJ system for 4 days, so I set it up in my basement two nights prior.
[00:16] <roasted> got to test it out, leran the mixers, etc.
[00:16] <waltman> pleia2: You need a Jewish aunt. Maybe you can rent one.
[00:16] <roasted> That made it easy.
[00:17] <ChinnoDog> It appears that the latest BIOS update to my motherboard has made the RAID bios incompatible with two of my drives
[00:17] <pleia2> waltman: maybe!
[00:17] <roasted> Plus I kind of liked being up front on the mic. I didn't like the idea going into it but once I was up there I took the "This is our dya, our show, and we'll run it as we see fit."
[00:17] <roasted> so it worked
[00:17] <waltman> pleia2: from my vast experience in going to jewish friends' weddings, the way you dance the hora is you follow what everyone else is doing
[00:17] <roasted> dangit waltman. I think I need to get myself something on the rocks.
[00:18] <pleia2> waltman: yeah, the main trouble s that non-jews vastly outnumber the jews attending, so we had to rope mjoseph's cousins into leading and hope everyone does ok :)
[00:18] <pleia2> going to run the wedding party through the basics on rehersal day
[00:19] <waltman> roasted: I've got some Wild Turkey 101 :)
[00:19] <pleia2> neither of us has ever been to a jewish wedding, I told the rabbi I saw fiddler on the roof though :D
[00:20] <waltman> mj's never been to one?!
[00:20] <pleia2> nope
[00:20] <waltman> he never had any relatives get married?
[00:20] <pleia2> he's the oldest kid in his generation, no one married before him
[00:20] <waltman> no family friends?
[00:20] <pleia2> apparently not
[00:20] <waltman> madness!
[00:21] <waltman> no college friends?
[00:21] <waltman> coworkers?
[00:21] <waltman> neighbors?
[00:21] <pleia2> nada
[00:21] <roasted> pleia2: another thing, we also had a six month engagement and had JUST bought a house, so initiatlly we DJed it ourselves due to costs.
[00:22] <roasted> we had her cousin do the pictures, who isn't a photographer, but she's just THAT creative and had a good eye, so she got some sweet pictures.
[00:22] <waltman> pleia2: Just remember -- there's always Vegas.
[00:22] <roasted> There was also a 2nd camera there that people were passing around, so we got quite a few shots (like 2,200)
[00:22] <pleia2> roasted: yeah, we accidentally had a long engagement (almost 2 years, we've both just been so busy with our careers)
[00:22] <roasted> waltman: very nice. regular wild turkey tho?
[00:22] <roasted> not even WT honey?
[00:23] <waltman> honey?
[00:23] <roasted> yeah
[00:23] <roasted> wild turkey has a honey version that I'm a fan of
[00:23] <roasted> regular wild turkey enduces my gag reflex with just the smell of it, let alone the taste
[00:23] <waltman> I've got that and a tiny bit of Laphroaig. Take your pick.
[00:23] <roasted> I have no idea what that is :D
[00:24] <jedijf> roasted: fsarchiver is what you want - it will expand - awesome tool
[00:24] <waltman> It's a particularly nice, peat Islay scotch.
[00:24] <roasted> pleia2: it also took a good deal of time setting up a 2nd tower as well. I had a backup just in case the music went south.
[00:24] <waltman> peaty
[00:24] <roasted> pleia2: plus my main rig has /home on a raid mirror, so it gave me some greater peace of mind
[00:24] <roasted> jedijf: thanks! I'll look into it.
[00:24] <roasted> CLI utility tho?
[00:24] <waltman> pleia2: where are you going for your honeymoon?
[00:25] <pleia2> waltman: depends on the time of day
[00:25] <waltman> heh
[00:25] <waltman> Well, when you already live in paradise... :)
[00:26] <pleia2> initial plan was europe trains, but then we decided that's too much work for a honeymoon, then were thinking mediterranean cruise, but those are in port every day so it's lots of days of running around cities too
[00:26] <roasted> we want to Antigua. Gas is 17 bucks a gallon there!
[00:26] <jedijf> roasted: http://www.fsarchiver.org/QuickStart
[00:26] <pleia2> then thought about panama canal cruise! which would have been awesome, but we can't really make it work job-wise
[00:26] <waltman> hawaii?
[00:26] <roasted> jedijf: I assume when I restore this, it's fully bootable, etc?
[00:26] <pleia2> so now we're thinking some caribbean cruise, plus maybe some time in a land resort
[00:27] <waltman> Paris is supposedly nice in April.
[00:27] <pleia2> except it's full of french people
[00:27] <pleia2> :D
[00:27] <waltman> and tourists
[00:27] <pleia2> the initial thought was Lisbon, Madrid, Paris and whatever else
[00:28] <waltman> Italy!
[00:28] <waltman> Venice is amazing
[00:28] <roasted> I have to assume... most of you are in PA?
[00:28] <waltman> And unlike Paris, isn't full of Italians.
[00:29]  * waltman <- Philly
[00:29] <pleia2> yeah, wanting to visit Italy is how we migrated to discussing mediterranean cruises, fewer risk of strikes ruining our trip than on land
[00:29] <pleia2> (Italy and Greece are kind of a mess right now)
[00:29] <pleia2> roasted: I lived in the Philly area for a while and am getting married there, but I'm in San Francisco these days
[00:29] <waltman> London!
[00:30] <pleia2> meh, London
[00:30] <waltman> pleia2: How about Montreal and Quebec City? It's like France, only with Canadians!
[00:30] <pleia2> they still don't like us yanks so much
[00:30] <roasted> pleia2: with your other half as wel?
[00:30] <waltman> but pubs! real ale!
[00:30] <pleia2> roasted: yeah, he grew up in the Philly area and moved out here to work at Google, I tagged along
[00:31] <roasted> google?
[00:31] <roasted> pfft, sign me up
[00:31] <pleia2> waltman: they love Americans in Dublin, never felt so welcome :)
[00:31] <jedijf> roasted: read the guides - it just works
[00:31] <pleia2> <3 Dublin
[00:31] <waltman> I've never felt unwelcome as an American anywhere.
[00:31] <roasted> jedijf: going over it now :D
[00:31] <roasted> looks good
[00:31] <pleia2> London made me feel unwelcome
[00:31] <jedijf> roasted: also, if not, you get to learn all about grub
[00:31] <pleia2> was buying a train ticket once and the guy was all "an American! Don't worry, I don't hate the yanks"
[00:31] <pleia2> uh, gee, thanks?
[00:32] <jedijf> i always dd the mbr and part tables
[00:32] <jedijf> separately
[00:32] <waltman> How about Germany and/or Scandinavia? They're clean, organized, and even if they hate you they're too polite to say anything about it.
[00:32] <pleia2> waltman: yeah, I'd love to go sometime, just some time when I'm not wanting relaxing trip :)
[00:32] <pleia2> I could use a beach
[00:33] <roasted> jedijf: but don't you think dd'ing a 10GB image over, then expanding the partition seems a little cleaner?
[00:33] <pleia2> was just in Copenhagen in November, they have a mermaid but no beaches
[00:33] <waltman> just pick a Caribbean beach resort.
[00:33] <pleia2> we're planning on doing 2 weeks, and I think 2 weeks in a resort would cause me to go out of my mind bored
[00:33] <pleia2> so thinking cruise and resort
[00:34] <waltman> spend a week or two drinking umbrella drinks
[00:34] <pleia2> I'd be figuring out ways to get online and work, because of the workaholic thing
[00:34] <pleia2> put me on a boat where internet costs $2.99/minute, that'll stop me :)
[00:35] <pleia2> (mostly)
[00:35] <waltman> I know -- Australia!
[00:35] <pleia2> hehe
[00:35] <waltman> beaches. friendly people. good food. interesting wildlife.
[00:35] <pleia2> kangaroos!
[00:35]  * TheLordOfTime puts pleia2 in a room where there's no internet except dialup internet that costs $7.99/minute to use.
[00:35] <waltman> Wait, I know the perfect place.
[00:35] <pleia2> TheLordOfTime: does it have a beach?
[00:35] <waltman> Bermuda! PINK BEACHES!
[00:36] <pleia2> waltman: the thought crossed my mind :)
[00:36] <TheLordOfTime> pleia2, no, but if you can figure out how to escape the room, there's a desert.  and 30 miles to the east there's a beach.
[00:36] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[00:36] <waltman> You can cruise from Philly to Bermuda, hang out for a few days, then cruise or fly back.
[00:36] <pleia2> waltman: yeah, that's one of the possibilities we're looking at (I think mostly they leave from jersey)
[00:37] <waltman> last I heard they left from the old Philly navy yard
[00:37] <pleia2> I think we were only looking at the giant boats
[00:37] <pleia2> not sure those can get up the river
[00:37] <waltman> they bring oil tankers up the river
[00:38] <waltman> they used to bring battleships
[00:38] <pleia2> yeah
[00:38] <pleia2> I don't know :)
[00:39] <waltman> the virgin islands are lovely
[00:39] <waltman> lots of options!
[00:40] <pleia2> yeah
[00:41] <waltman> aww, no more cruises from philly
[00:41] <waltman> you'd have to leave from baltimore or bayonne
[00:42] <pleia2> yeah
[00:42] <pleia2> also thinking of flying to do fl and just leaving for ft lauderdale
[00:43] <pleia2> because crusing down the east coast is boring and cold :)
[00:43] <waltman> nod
[00:43] <rmg51> http://www.aarp.org/travel/cruises/info-12-2012/which-cruise-vacation-port-trips.html#slide1
[00:43] <rmg51> pleia2: ^
[00:44] <waltman> AARP?
[00:44] <pleia2> cruises are for old people
[00:45] <pleia2> mjoseph said we can't do an antarctica cruise :(
[00:45] <rmg51> I get all my Moms email
[00:45] <rmg51> why not?
[00:46] <pleia2> they aren't warm or relaxing either, they tend to call them "expedition tours" ;)
[00:46] <pleia2> plus the boats are too small
[00:46] <pleia2> seasick--
[00:46] <waltman> maybe you could split the difference and go to Rio
[00:46] <waltman> beaches? check. friendly? check.
[00:47] <waltman> umbrella drinks? probably.
[00:47] <pleia2> the panama canal cruise we were looking at stopped in columbia, I was muy excited about a south american stop
[00:47] <waltman> costa rico's supposed to be awesome
[00:47] <waltman> rica
[00:48] <pleia2> yeah, mjoseph went to a resort there once and loved it
[00:48] <MutantTurkey> waltman: yes thank you
[00:48] <pleia2> but I vetoed that resource because he went with an ex ;)
[00:48] <waltman> hah
[00:48] <MutantTurkey> you nicely avoided bringing up my resumne
[00:48] <MutantTurkey> btw I got the JOB!!! woohooohooo
[00:48] <waltman> I almost did!
[00:48] <pleia2> MutantTurkey: congrats
[00:48] <waltman> awesome! congrats!
[00:48] <MutantTurkey> :-)
[00:48] <MutantTurkey> plus my current job is still continuing
[00:49] <MutantTurkey> it's all over my head right now, but I suppose I'll catch up as it goes along
[00:49] <MutantTurkey> lots of talk about algorithms, machine learning, genome sequencing and such
[00:49] <MutantTurkey> rather scary stuff for me
[00:50] <waltman> MutantTurkey: re that conversation with Breen, it's funny how being a postdoc, doing very similar stuff to a grad student, is so much more respectable to profs.
[00:50] <MutantTurkey> yup.
[00:50] <MutantTurkey> because before you're their bitches
[00:50] <MutantTurkey> figuratively
[00:50] <MutantTurkey> literally
[00:50] <waltman> I'm in the club now.
[00:50] <MutantTurkey> exactly.
[00:50] <roasted> dang
[00:50] <MutantTurkey> but I bet, when you become an associate professor, you join another 'club" then get tenure? you're in the _club_ _club_
[00:50] <roasted> a pickup truck hit a school bus causing it to land on its roof... 30 kids inside... and the worst injury is a "cut to the head?" Talk about a miracle
[00:51] <waltman> wow
[00:51] <waltman> ok, time for dinner. later.
[00:51] <roasted> Adams County
[00:51] <MutantTurkey> roasted: was that in philly today? I saw a bus being towed by spring garden looked like it caught fire
[00:51] <roasted> http://www.wgal.com/news/susquehanna-valley/york-adams/School-bus-flips-after-hitting-pickup-truck-head-on/-/9704248/18100548/-/xjl4a6/-/index.html
[00:53] <MutantTurkey> crazy
[00:54] <MutantTurkey> So I was looking around at houses for rent today, and I am so excited to move into the city...
[00:54] <MutantTurkey> commute to drexel and temple in under ten minutes? I am psyched
[00:54] <roasted> nice
[00:54] <roasted> I had a 30 mile commute to school daily. It sucked hard.
[00:54] <MutantTurkey> yeah mine is 10 miles, but takes about an hour on the train
[00:55] <MutantTurkey> not to mention getting to the station, depending on the trains, waiting for the trains, buying tickets
[00:55] <MutantTurkey> plus this new job is a sizable pay increase, so I can finally afford it.
[00:55] <roasted> mo money!
[00:55] <MutantTurkey> waltman: and I think its longer term, breen kept giving me the run around as I was a temp the whole time
[00:55] <MutantTurkey> not his fault, but I was always doing odd jobs.
[01:04] <roasted> man, it was so worth this home server upgrade
[01:04] <roasted> went from an atom nettop with external HDDs to a mATX box with a low wattage i3
[01:05] <roasted> the proc runs at almost half the temperature and has significantly more horsepower while (overall) only utilizing THREE more watts of power
[01:05] <roasted> nettop, 18w, external HDD 1 7.5w, external HDD 2 7.5w
[01:05] <roasted> both of those HDDs are internal to the i3 box... 36W usage vs 33W of the nettop/externals.
[01:05] <roasted> win
[01:07] <MutantTurkey> I have a low power atom
[01:07] <MutantTurkey> I really like it
[01:07] <MutantTurkey> is the i3 really better?
[01:08] <MutantTurkey> how are you checking watt usage?
[01:08] <roasted> kill-a-watt
[01:08] <roasted> the only reason I upgraded anything was because I was sick of having two external hdd's
[01:08] <roasted> but I loved the atom for its super low power usage
[01:09] <roasted> I'm adding more and more to my server, so having a little extra power was a bonus
[01:09] <roasted> but I wanted it to be as efficient as remotely possible
[01:09] <roasted> seeing it only uses 3w more comes out to like 5 bucks a year cost difference
[01:09] <roasted> I wouldn't have upgraded it if I had an atom inside a tower, ya know
[01:09] <roasted> but this is a two bird/one stone thing, here's why
[01:10] <roasted> My first child is on the way. I've been looking for a way to have an indoor camera in the baby room to utilize as a baby monitor.
[01:10] <pleia2> woo, congrats again :)
[01:10] <roasted> That way if we hear noises, we can have a visual to see if they actually need tended to or if we're just hearing things
[01:10] <roasted> thanks!
[01:10] <roasted> the nettop is wireless
[01:10] <roasted> so I'm going to double-side-tape that sucker to the back of an LCD and stream the mjpg URL from my indoor wireless camera.
[01:10] <roasted> That way we have a 17 inch display right there in the bedroom to see what's up
[01:10] <roasted> AND, it's low wattage.
[01:11] <roasted> I would have probably tolerated having external hdds everywhere with the nettop but since I could have the perfect re-purposed plan for it, it made sense to dish the money
[01:11] <roasted> but yes, I'm very happy with my new rig, however that doesn't make me love my nettop any less.
[01:12] <roasted> i3 3220T, ASRock B75 mobo, no GPU (integrated), 300w 80+ PSU, 3x500GB HDD
[01:12] <roasted> 36w idle
[01:12] <roasted> temp is currently 23c core 0, 31c core 1
[01:12] <roasted> my atom ran at about 40/44
[06:32] <ChinnoDog> I hope I get to sleep tonight
