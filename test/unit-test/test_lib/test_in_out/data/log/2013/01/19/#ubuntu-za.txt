[13:04] <Tonberry> somewere in software sources i think
[13:04] <Kilos> ah ty
[13:16] <magespawn> hey Kilos
[13:16] <Kilos> wb magespawn 
[13:16] <magespawn> hectic day
[13:17] <Kilos> whats happening?
[13:17] <magespawn> the hluhluwe hotel's network when down completly
[13:18] <Kilos> did you fix it?
[13:18] <Kilos> or was it internet related
[13:18] <magespawn> by passed parts of the network so that some are back online
[13:19] <Kilos> you still gotta find the cause?
[13:19] <magespawn> no something in their switch room is faulty and the person who installed the network did not oable the cables
[13:19] <magespawn> s/oable/label
[13:20] <Kilos> eish thats gonna be a job tracing them
[13:20] <magespawn> yes still gotta find the cause
[13:20] <magespawn> yup can be done just lots of time
[13:20] <magespawn> or lots of people
[13:21] <Kilos> hehe we used to use tone generators you connect to one end then go to all the other ends to find which one is which
[13:21] <Kilos> and
[13:21] <Kilos> and label as you locate each one if you gonna do their work
[13:22] <magespawn> there are cable tester etc but  too expensive for me
[13:22] <Kilos> you must be able to make one up man
[13:22] <Kilos> its ethernet cables hey
[13:22] <magespawn> yes one cable at a time, you only have to do the ends at the switch really
[13:22] <magespawn> yes
[13:23] <magespawn> or more specifically utp cat5e
[13:23] <Kilos> there must be a way to send a tone on them 
[13:23] <Kilos> of then you need earphones or telkom headset to listen other end
[13:24] <Kilos> well at least you have a start
[13:24] <Kilos> some are working
[13:25] <magespawn> i have a continuity tester but takes time to walk around and check each cable end, there are about 40
[13:25] <magespawn> cables that is
[13:25] <magespawn> i am on my way home chat later.
[13:35] <Kilos> k
[16:22] <Kilos> yo inetpro ping
[16:23] <Kilos> you still here nlsthzn 
[16:23] <Kilos> not bed time for ahabs
[16:23] <Kilos> ?
[16:45] <magespawn> Whats up Kilos?
[16:49] <Kilos> the pros commands worked kiff to copy this machines archives to the server
[16:49] <Kilos> wanted to thank him
[16:52] <magespawn> Cool
[16:53] <Kilos> yeah and i can sudi -i it as well so coulda been a shorter trip
[16:53] <Kilos> but he said try stay clear of sudo -i unless you know what you doing
[16:53] <Kilos> lol
[16:53] <magespawn> It makes you root
[16:54] <Kilos> yeah
[16:54] <Kilos> coulda gone root on server and copied these archives directly into servers archives
[16:56] <Kilos> or thse archives which i have as packsp on desktop here
[16:59] <magespawn> With sudo -i though i think all restrictions are lifted
[16:59] <Kilos> yeah but not from both pcs at once in one command i think
[17:00] <Kilos> on same terminal
[17:13] <Kilos> now i still gotta learn sshing to another ubuntu pc then to win pcs
[17:13] <Kilos> methinks one will need to learn all the new dos commands
[17:13] <Kilos> sigh
[17:13] <magespawn> I will have to scroll the logs 
[17:14] <Kilos> i can give you the commands
[17:14] <Kilos> logs long
[17:14] <magespawn> Ssh to anothe ubuntu is the same as to your server
[17:14] <magespawn> Not right now on the phone
[17:14] <Kilos> i battled doing it to maverick
[17:15] <Kilos> i have commands saved so anytime
[17:15] <Kilos> scrolling is major work
[17:17] <magespawn> With win there is a program called putty to ssh from
[17:17] <magespawn> Think you can use cygwin to ssh to from ubuntu
[17:17]  * nlsthzn is back
[17:19] <Kilos> i saw putty in our repos i think
[17:20] <Kilos> Telnet/SSH client for X
[17:21] <Kilos> i dunno what X is but we have putty as well
[17:23] <magespawn> X is the video part/server of ubuntu i think
[17:24] <Kilos> ya the X11 stuff and Xorg
[17:27] <Kilos> only if you ssh to a win machine our commands wont work unles there is a dos/linux converter built in
[17:27] <Kilos> so ssh with gui could be good
[17:28] <nlsthzn> no rugby for me online tonight :(
[17:28] <nlsthzn> not even on radio
[17:28] <Kilos> i wish i could understand better how everything works
[17:28] <Kilos> aw nlsthzn that sucks
[17:28] <Kilos> who is playing
[17:29] <nlsthzn> lions vs russia
[17:29] <Kilos> ah
[17:29] <Kilos> only our dstv guys will get that. dont think we will
[17:30] <nlsthzn> true but I often got a stream online... or at least rsg or radio pretoria
[17:30] <nlsthzn> oh well

[17:43] <Kilos> nlsthzn, ^^
[17:44] <nlsthzn> thanks uncle Kilos ... all that is spam sites to drive advertising... the real sites maintain a low profile cause they get shut down... and the game isnt high profile enough to have some of the regulars interested
[17:46] <nlsthzn> I'll watch a live sc2 tourney
[17:46] <nuvolari> o/
[17:46] <nuvolari> aloha
[17:47] <nlsthzn> http://www.twitch.tv/esltv_sc2

[17:47] <nlsthzn> ntfs at the moment :p
[17:47] <magespawn> Ola nuvolari
[17:47] <nlsthzn> I never had issues with ext4
[17:47] <nuvolari> nlsthzn: is it okay if I ignore you just because of that?
[17:47] <nuvolari> :P

[17:48] <nuvolari> hmm, ext4 it is then... going to be my photo drive
[17:49] <nuvolari> not sure if I should keep the 1tb or 500Gb for photos :-/
[17:49] <Kilos> hi nuvolari 
[17:49] <nuvolari> Capturing in RAW format takes its toll
[17:50] <nuvolari> it looks like ext4 still performs better than xfs and btrfs
[17:50] <magespawn> Then the 1tb it is then
[17:50] <nuvolari> oh hi TaraLS 
[17:50]  * nlsthzn has been sorting out photos for two days ... :( stil have 1000 to go to tag faces :'(
