[11:18] <kyrbi> hey there
[11:19] <kyrbi> I have got Ubuntu 12 server which I can access by SSH. I'd like to have GUI on it. So I have used command apt-get install ubuntu-desktop. Everything installed, can you help me what I have to do next?
[11:21] <mlankhorst> 'sudo start lightdm'
[11:22] <kyrbi> It will start Unity GUI?
[11:22] <kyrbi> lightdm start/running, process 1012
[11:22] <kyrbi> done
[11:23] <kyrbi> btw thank you very much for your time
[11:23] <mlankhorst> np
[11:24] <kyrbi> But the server is far far away from me, so I guess I need VPN, right?
[11:25] <kyrbi> *VNC
[11:37] <chrisccoulson> gah, i hate you gcc
[11:37] <ogra_> it hates you too
[11:39] <chrisccoulson> heh
[11:39] <chrisccoulson> that's clearly true

[15:16] <apt-get_install> anyone here that can explain what "acpitz" in lm-senors is?
[15:23] <dobey> apt-get_install: #ubuntu is the help channel, but "tz" is "thermal zone" i think, so they'd be ambient zone temperatures afaik
[15:23] <apt-get_install> ah thanks
[15:25] <kenvandine> jbicha, are you going to do an empathy upload after telepathy-logger gets NEW'd?
[15:26] <jbicha> kenvandine: yes, otherwise it would get stuck in -proposed
[15:27] <kenvandine> cool, thx
[15:27] <kenvandine> i just noticed empathy is busted :)
[16:05] <ricotz> jbicha, updating to mozjs 1.8.7 (esr10) snapshot is pretty safe and works fine here
[16:05] <ricotz> chrisccoulson, hi ^

[19:43] <robru> sarnold, haha yeah, yesterday was actually so sunny that I had to move away from my favorite window seat because the awful sun was too much in my eyes ;-)
[19:44] <sarnold> robru: haha, nice. :)
