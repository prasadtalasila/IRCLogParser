[07:01] <darkxst> ricotz, you can revert this http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/commit/src/shell-global.c?id=6f605598de1eb4361ef912e85edb27a8b7b96b21 under js188
[07:44] <ricotz> darkxst, i see, "should" or "can"?
[07:45] <darkxst> "should" since the gc deadlocks seem to be fixed now in js188
[07:46] <ricotz> yeah, i mean, does something break if i don't
[07:46] <darkxst> nothing will break if don't
[07:46] <darkxst> but memory usage drops significantly
[07:47] <darkxst> if you do
[07:48] <ricotz> ok
[10:05] <darkxst> ricotz, you tried the gc fix?
[10:06] <ricotz> darkxst, yes
[10:06] <ricotz> i uploaded updated gjs packages too
[10:07] <ricotz> (to the former location)
[10:08] <darkxst> might be worth putting them into staging? solid as a rock here
[10:09] <ricotz> the patches for 187 are quite small and easy, so this transition it reasonable
[10:10] <darkxst> ricotz, yeh most of the fixes for 187 were also safe on 185
[10:10] <ricotz> i need to think about going for 188 with this patch stack without knowing a js188 tarball will come
[10:11] <darkxst> Jasper thinks he has convinced them to make a tarball
[10:11] <darkxst> but there has not been any progess
[10:12] <darkxst> and apparently politics gets in the way of using an official ff release rather than a standalone one
[10:12] <ricotz> yes the 187 version of gjs in testing contains only two small patches, and that i am comfortable with letting it loose on the public ;)
[10:13] <ricotz> i would like to see some progress on the js188 release first
[10:13] <ricotz> i will think about it
[10:13] <ricotz> bbl
[10:14] <darkxst> I personally still don't get why we need a release! politics aside, if we take mozilla out of the release loop, then can update whenever
[10:15] <darkxst> Surely all distro's can handle taking a mozilla release, and adding 2-3 patches
