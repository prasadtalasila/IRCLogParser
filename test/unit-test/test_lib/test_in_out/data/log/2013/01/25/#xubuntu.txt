[19:52] <frustratedtech> Anyone having issues with bluetooth on 12.10?
[19:55] <Cheri703> my keyboard works fine, my headset hates the world, but it was like that in vanilla ubuntu on 12.04 and 12.10
[19:55] <Cheri703> *bluetooth on both of those btw
[19:55] <Cheri703> Anyone have thoughts on this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1921687
[19:58] <frustratedtech> seems i cannot use a bluetooth connection.
[19:58] <frustratedtech> mainly trying to connect my iphone5 to bluetooth.
[20:13] <Unit193> Cheri703: I'd check with GridCube when he comes around, but he may not know.  Would it be an option to autohide it?
[20:13] <Cheri703> I tried that, but it is REALLY hard to hit the right spot to make it pop out when you're balancing between two screens
[20:13] <Cheri703> Also, for the way I'm wanting to lay things out, non-hidden would work best
[20:19] <Cheri703> also: a thanks to whoever included the ZOMG Ponies! Theme for notifications. I have EVERYTHING on a dark background/light text theme now (including chrome and quassel), and the GIANT pink with yellow comic sans notifications are kind of perfect so I don't miss things. :) It is a bit startling to have an email notification take up a quarter of the screen, but that's probably good. :D
[20:20] <TheSheep> Cheri703: plus the comic sans font, just perfect
[20:20] <Cheri703> yeah
[20:21] <TheSheep> you can easily make your own, you know
[20:21] <Cheri703> I am like "do de do de do worky work work OMGWTF?!?!" "oh...an email"
[20:21] <Cheri703> eh, this works :)
[20:21] <Cheri703> I downloaded a theme from xfce-look
[20:21] <TheSheep> personally I like the policy of checking the e-mail twice a day
[20:22] <TheSheep> at 10 am and at 15
[20:22] <Cheri703> that + hacker vision extension for chrome, dark theme for quassel, happy eyes :D
[20:22] <Cheri703> I work from home doing support, so I am always connected
[20:24] <frustratedtech> im a support guy too :D
[20:25] <Cheri703> I'm more on the customer support side than the technical support (at least at this job) :)
[20:25] <Cheri703> I do a bunch of other stuff too
[20:26] <frustratedtech> I do server support.  So gotta deal with clients more often than I please :D
[20:26] <Cheri703> heh
[20:26] <Cheri703> rebooting to see if I can get autokey working again, back in a bit.
[20:30] <Cheri703> ok back
[20:42] <toxicsgz> Xubuntu 12.04 with new netbook after two days of frustration with windoze. Whoohooo! :)
[20:43] <toxicsgz> 1GB Ram, will check how much mobo will support but how much Ram will xubuntu support?
[20:44] <torax> enough
[20:46] <toxicsgz> Not really helpful?
[20:47] <MoL0ToV> i have the display brightness that don't work with fn key in xubuntu
[20:47] <torax> in theory 64 bit OS can support 16EB of memory
[20:47] <MoL0ToV> howto fix?
[20:47] <MoL0ToV> the audio volume works instead
[20:47] <holstein> toxicsgz: more than a netbook will support
[20:47] <MoL0ToV> or other things
[20:47] <holstein> !pae
[20:47] <ubottu> To use more than ~3.2GB RAM on a 32bit system you can install the PAE-enabled kernel. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingPAE for more info
[20:47] <MoL0ToV> but brightness no
[20:47] <toxicsgz> OK torax thx, I doubt a netbook mobo will support nearly that so I am in the clear :)
[20:48] <holstein> ^^ and thats just for more than 3gb's on 32bit systems toxicsgz
[20:48] <Cheri703> For some reason after a reboot, the application icons aren't showing up on my panel
[20:48] <toxicsgz> Yep as i thought thx all, wn't put more than 2 in anyway.
[20:48] <Cheri703> even if I change themes
[20:49] <holstein> Cheri703: i would test as a new user to remove your config from the equation
[20:49] <Cheri703> (I just installed xubuntu yesterday, so I'm still playing with it)
[20:49] <Cheri703> ok
[20:49] <holstein> toxicsgz: you likely cant
[20:49] <Cheri703> good call
[20:51] <Cheri703> hrm, if I change theme and log out and back in, they're back
[20:52] <toxicsgz> Will play fr a week or two but interested to know if users install xubuntu on mid to high end desktops. RUnning linux mint 13 currently but liking xubuntu a lot in to days.
[20:52] <drc> toxicsgz: More than you can afford :)  According to AskUbuntu: A LOT! (Actually 2^64) but because of hardware limits and real world computers the limit is around 1TB ( 1024GB RAM)
[20:53] <holstein> toxicsgz: xubuntu is freely available to anyone, and its a good match with most any system, so its used really anywhere
[20:53] <toxicsgz> :) I think 2 GB will suffice for my netbook purposes.
[20:53] <toxicsgz> Hmm! Might consider this for my desktop also :)
[20:53] <Siilence> toxicsgz: I ran 2gb ram on my main workstation with xubuntu.
[20:53] <toxicsgz> :
[20:53] <Siilence> I simply had no need to upgrade.
[20:54] <Siilence> Because it was blazingly fast.
[20:54] <Siilence> Linux devs are weird that way.
[20:54] <toxicsgz> Some things hang with just 1GB so two is a must.
[20:54] <Siilence> They dont assume resources are endless and that there is no need to make everything as bloated as possible.
[20:55] <Siilence> It used to be that good code used as little as possible.
[20:55] <holstein> i use both.. i wouldnt say "a must" but its nice
[20:55] <holstein> depends on what you are doing.. my netbook with 2gb's rarely needs/ uses 1gb
[20:56] <toxicsgz> HD video hANGS A BIT
[20:56] <holstein> i doubt the ram will help with that
[20:56] <holstein> ram doesnt make the system any faster
[20:57] <toxicsgz> hMM! YOU MAY BE RIGHT THERE
[20:57] <toxicsgz> sorry caps
[20:57] <toxicsgz> I mean HD stream
[20:57] <toxicsgz> but same I guess
[20:57] <Unit193> holstein: Can if it's swapping out like crazy. ;)  (Mine does that, had to try a couple things to make it work better)
[20:58] <toxicsgz> I think the CPU struggles more than the Ram
[20:58] <holstein> sure, but i doubt thats the case when playing a vid
[20:58] <Siilence> Using all the ram isnt necessarily bad.
[20:58] <holstein> but, you can test.. and try for youself toxicsgz
[20:58] <Siilence> It depends what it's doing with it.
[20:58] <Siilence> RAM is meant to be used.
[20:58] <Nothing_Much> Hello, I'm having trouble with Firefox 19 opening Thunar Preferences instead of Thunar
[20:58] <Siilence> Swapping sucks, though.
[20:58] <Siilence> Unless you have ssd in which case it wont matter much, usually.
[20:59] <toxicsgz> Well thx for the input, new xubuntu user very happy :)
[20:59] <Siilence> But tweak to noswap, but then it might just freeze ;)
[20:59] <toxicsgz> Ah! I like th SSD idea :)
[20:59] <Siilence> (so dont do that)
[21:04] <Nothing_Much> So uh.. my preferred applications are set to Thunar, but it opens the preferences for some reason.
[21:07] <holstein> Nothing_Much: it?
[21:08] <Cheri703> Anyone familiar with poking around in theme settings to try to figure out why my the window button icons vanished?
[21:08] <Nothing_Much> *Firefox
[21:09] <Cheri703> Or anyone have a deviant art account they'd be willing to use to post a comment and ask about it? (I don't really want to create one >_<)
[21:09] <holstein> Cheri703: i just use well supported themes, that just work
[21:10] <Cheri703> well, yeah
[21:10] <Cheri703> but this one is PERFECT other than the icons not showing up :s
[21:10] <holstein> you can always just borrow the elements and/or ideas and make your own
[21:10] <holstein> Cheri703: i would say that is not perfect then
[21:10] <holstein> lots of changes with gtk going on... hard to tell
[21:11] <Cheri703> yeah, I might try modifying one that came with xubuntu
[21:13] <Unit193> The shimmer themes will be the most compatible, Albatross is pretty good as is Blackbird for darker themes.
[21:24] <Cheri703> this is...DARK. http://sixsixfive.deviantart.com/art/ACID-280889262 not just outlines dark, everything dark
[21:24] <Cheri703> my eyes are much happier with this + hacker vision extension in chrome
[21:28] <koegs> i like this one a lot: http://www.webupd8.org/2013/01/beautiful-mediterraneannight-gtk-36.html
[21:28] <Cheri703> ooo, I will try it, thanks :)
[21:33] <Cheri703> not *quite* as dark, but still good! and my icons are back! Thanks koegs!
[22:05] <MoL0ToV> brightness control dont work on my xubuntu on my notebook someone can help me?
[22:19] <holstein> MoL0ToV: on the keyboard, correct?
[22:20] <holstein> i would look into graphics drivers.. i would ask yourself just how important this is.. i would try live CD's and see if something "just works" and see what is making it work
[22:23] <MoL0ToV> if i add the applet on the panel that control the bightness i can change it
[22:23] <MoL0ToV> but not via function keys
[22:23] <MoL0ToV> fn+f5 fn+f6
[22:27] <Cheri703> all I need to do now is get the panels functioning properly on the edges between my monitors and I will be a happy camper :)
[22:28] <Cheri703> MoL0ToV: do those keys do other things? like are they not matching up with the assigned shortcut that's printed on the keyboard?
[22:29] <MoL0ToV> is all ok but brightness
[22:29] <Cheri703> what model of notebook?
[22:30] <holstein> MoL0ToV: well, its not the brightness then, its the function keys on your keyboard
[22:31] <holstein> MoL0ToV: brightness is fine, and you *can* control it
[22:31] <holstein> MoL0ToV: i would search by the model # of your maching and see if anyone has the function keys working
[22:32] <holstein> http://askubuntu.com/questions/13000/keyboard-function-keys-do-not-work
[22:32] <heliocentrique> hey guys, is Xubuntu as easy to use as Ubuntu or more complicated like Lubuntu ?
[22:32] <holstein> http://askubuntu.com/questions/233312/how-to-make-keyboard-backlight-fn-buttons-work-in-samsung-series-9 might be helpful too
[22:32] <holstein> heliocentrique: i dont find lubuntu more complicated
[22:32] <holstein> heliocentrique: complicated can be a matter of opinion
[22:32] <koegs> heliocentrique: if you come from gnome2, you will find it easy to use xubuntu
[22:32] <holstein> heliocentrique: fire it up live and see if it meets your needs
[22:33] <holstein> heliocentrique: if you are looking for main ubuntu/unity, then just use it
[22:34] <heliocentrique> holstein:  the package manager on Lubuntu is more complicated than Software Center IMO, Ubuntu lags too much on my netbook and I need a very user-friendly OS (like OSX or Windows)
[22:34] <heliocentrique> I tried Lubuntu in the past and it seems uncompleted, so I was looking at Xubuntu. I have limited data that's why I ask before downloading
[22:35] <holstein> heliocentrique: lubuntu *is* ubuntu, so you can install and use the package manager of your choice, same as with xubuntu
[22:36] <Cheri703> heliocentrique: I just switched to xubuntu yesterday. I really like it. I've been using regular ubuntu for a while, and it was fine, but xubuntu seems way more customizable
[22:36] <Cheri703> and all of my normal stuff runs fine.
[22:36] <MoL0ToV> holstein, is a asus k56c
[22:37] <holstein> MoL0ToV: thats how i would search then... asus k56c ubuntu function keys.. also, i might just not bother since you can adjust the brightness, and i find that if that is going to be easy, its working out of the box
[22:38] <MoL0ToV> also the touchpad is bad
[22:38] <MoL0ToV> there are a touchpad that goeas also over the 2 buttons..
[22:39] <MoL0ToV> so when you click, ch pointer moves and you click out of the place..
[22:39] <holstein> bad?.. if the hardware is bad, linux wont fix it
[22:39] <holstein> you can try other drivers.. i usually test with live CD's.. its an easy way to use other kernels temporarily and test hardware support
[22:40] <MoL0ToV> ok thx
[22:40] <MoL0ToV> bye
[22:41] <Cheri703> holstein, were you in here earlier when I posted a link to the issue I'm having with panels?
[22:43] <holstein> Cheri703: the issue with the theme, i thought
[22:50] <Cheri703> that was one issue, I have another :)
[22:50] <Cheri703> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1921687
[22:54] <holstein> i just use one panel
[22:54] <holstein> you can do whatever you like im sure.. i would look into maybe just running a different panel
[22:54] <holstein> maybe tint2
[22:54] <holstein> maybe that would be worse.. not sure
[22:54] <Cheri703> I don't know if it's a bug or just some setting a dev could change
[22:54] <Cheri703> it's something about the middle being treated as floating
[22:55] <GridCube> what
[22:55] <GridCube> whats the problem Cheri703 ?
[22:55] <holstein> Cheri703: its more of a "feature" :) ..but you can get what you want, im just not sure how
[22:55] <Cheri703> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1921687
[22:55] <holstein> GridCube: bascially seperate panels per screen on dual head
[22:55] <Cheri703> basically: vertical panels along the inner edge between two monitors are treated as floating vs edge
[22:55] <Cheri703> so when I maximize they go under instead of butting up against it
[22:56] <Cheri703> and that is the opposite of what I want
[22:56] <holstein> oh.. maybe im mis-understanding
[22:56] <Cheri703> separate panels are possible
[22:56] <holstein> you want the panels to be over the windows?
[22:56] <Cheri703> no
[22:56] <GridCube> Cheri703, how its your set up¿?
[22:56] <holstein> maximisedwindows going under makes the panels going over
[22:57] <Cheri703> basically, if I put a panel on the outer edges, when I maximize the window, it doesn't go under it, it goes up against the edge. if I put them on the inner edges, the window goes under it and there's no way for it to be treated as solid
[22:57] <Cheri703> GridCube: I have two 24" monitors
[22:57] <Cheri703> I'm running xfce 4.12
[22:57] <holstein> Cheri703: its going to be all about the nomencature for your search queries
[22:58] <Cheri703> yeah, I spent some time looking last night
[22:59] <Cheri703> the settings for an "outer" panel and an "inner" panel will be identical, but it still treats the "inner" panels like they're floating instead of edge
[22:59] <GridCube> are you sure they are touching the "center"
[22:59] <GridCube> ?
[22:59] <holstein> sure, but me nor google will understand what you mean by outer and inner
[22:59] <Cheri703> yeah GridCube
[22:59] <Cheri703> holstein: I was looking for all sorts of stuff about edge panels and multi-monitors
[23:00] <holstein> im not sure that the dual head matters
[23:00] <Cheri703> it does
[23:00] <Cheri703> edge panels work fine
[23:00] <Cheri703> as expected
[23:00] <holstein> i would take that out of the equation and try on one screen
[23:00] <GridCube> my set up is different so i cant help you, sorry, i use a combination of vga/hdmi and it has its oddieties
[23:00] <Cheri703> it is only the edges in between them
[23:00] <Cheri703> they work fine holstein
[23:00] <holstein> Cheri703: then just do it the same
[23:00] <Cheri703> GridCube: right now I'm vga/dvi, next week I'll be dvi/hdmi
[23:00] <Cheri703> holstein: I did! I set them up identically and it still behaves this way
[23:01] <Cheri703> I spent a few hours poking at it last night
[23:01] <GridCube> im my case, you can only have different panels and each monitor is treated a whole different screen
[23:01] <GridCube> but the pointer can move around both
[23:02] <Cheri703> hmm...mine is set up in displays as "x monitor is to the left of y monitor" and "y monitor is to the right of x monitor" so xubuntu is recognizing them as two separate monitors
[23:02] <holstein> Cheri703: i would take screen shots or whatever would help describe "this way"
[23:03] <Cheri703> basically "make a floating panel, see how it behaves when you maximize a window" "make an edge panel, see how it behaves when you maximize a window" "when the panel is on the edge between two monitors it behaves like a floating panel instead of an edge panel" the end.
[23:03] <Cheri703> I can do screenshots if necessary
[23:06] <holstein> Cheri703: that is the difference though, i thought
[23:06] <holstein> Cheri703: if you move them, they change.. that should be the case on one monitor
[23:06] <Cheri703> each monitor has 4 edges
[23:06] <Cheri703> even when set up as a dual monitor setup
[23:06] <holstein> but, i would have to set this up first hand, and i can.. and will.. but i cant now
[23:06] <Cheri703> so as a dual-monitor thing, I should have 8 edges to use as edge panels
[23:06] <Cheri703> I have 4
[23:06] <Cheri703> I want 8
[23:07] <Cheri703> because I want the left edge of the right monitor and the right edge of the left monitor to be places I can mount a launcher panel
[23:07] <frustratedtech> ah, your using an expanded desktop between both monitors right now
[23:07] <Cheri703> and have them behave as edge panels with regard to maximized windows
[23:07] <Cheri703> not mirrored
[23:07] <Cheri703> so...I guess?
[23:08] <Cheri703> but I still want panels
[23:08] <Cheri703> :)
[23:10] <frustratedtech> so you have 2 panels now and want to add more?
[23:10] <GridCube> as said you can have panels for each just add new ones and send them to the proper screen
[23:10] <Cheri703> I have one right now, I'd like to have a total of two, one on each monitor on the inner edges between them
[23:10] <Cheri703> creating them is NOT the issue
[23:11] <Cheri703> their behavior is the issue
[23:11] <Cheri703> I can make 80 panels if I want
[23:11] <Cheri703> I get that
[23:11] <Cheri703> ok, screenshot time, hang on a few minutes
[23:11] <GridCube> but wait, wait wait, im being confused right now... what version of xfce are you using?
[23:11] <Cheri703> 4.12
[23:11] <Cheri703> so I could have the monitors non-mirrored
[23:12] <holstein> the problem is not with the panels.. nor with anything
[23:12] <GridCube> but thats not the official version for xubuntu bro
[23:12] <holstein> you want the inner edges to be "edges"
[23:12] <holstein> and they are not
[23:12]  * frustratedtech seems i can mount a panel on the inner edge
[23:13] <Cheri703> frustratedtech: yeah, they can be there
[23:13] <Cheri703> now maximize a window
[23:13] <GridCube> i have them on the inner edge aswel, im using 4.10
[23:13] <Cheri703> the window goes under
[23:13] <Cheri703> I can uninstall 4.12, but my understanding was that it wouldn't support the dual monitors without it
[23:13] <holstein> Cheri703: i have one of those on my xfce rig.. and it works fine
[23:13] <holstein> its not in the inside edge
[23:14] <Cheri703> holstein: is it on the outside edge?
[23:14] <holstein> Cheri703: i have dual head on the stock
[23:14] <Cheri703> weird
[23:14] <holstein> Cheri703: correct
[23:14] <GridCube> if the panel its unticked on "reserve space on the borders" it will be floatin
[23:14] <holstein> its on the outside edge, and i have ^^ that setting
[23:14] <frustratedtech> I see
[23:14] <Cheri703> GridCube: it acts the same both ways
[23:14] <Cheri703> I tried it
[23:14] <GridCube> its not the case here
[23:14] <Cheri703> frustratedtech: do you see what I'm saying?
[23:14] <Cheri703> alright, let me uninstall 4.12
[23:14] <holstein> yeah, could be your version
[23:15] <frustratedtech> yes, the window is below the panel
[23:15] <frustratedtech> thats wonderful lol  i like it
[23:15] <Cheri703> IT IS SO ANNOYING!
[23:17] <frustratedtech> yea, so panel can be on one screen and maximize under but when you max on the other screen with no added panel it has blank space
[23:17] <Cheri703> yurp
[23:19] <frustratedtech> seems that you found a bug
[23:19] <Cheri703> are you running 4.12 or 4.10?
[23:19] <Cheri703> frustratedtech: ^^
[23:19] <Unit193> 4.12 isn't out yet, not even preview 1 is.
[23:19] <frustratedtech> I'm on 4.10
[23:20]  * Cheri703 is running 4.12
[23:20] <frustratedtech> So I see the same thing as you
[23:20] <Cheri703> so if it's doing the same behavior it's not the fault of 4.12
[23:20] <frustratedtech> correct
[23:20] <Cheri703> so then I might not bother trying to revert
[23:20] <Cheri703> because I have no idea how to do that without killing something :)
[23:21] <Unit193> Cheri703: If you need to revert, ppa-purge is a very handy tool!  (Maybe not for this, but others)
[23:21] <frustratedtech> yea, i'd say its just a bug with xfce4-panel
[23:21] <frustratedtech> Can you take a screen shot and file a report?
[23:21] <Cheri703> Unit193: I know nothing about that, I will google
[23:22] <Unit193> !ppa-purge
[23:22] <ubottu> To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: « sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> » – For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
[23:22] <Cheri703> nice!
[23:24] <frustratedtech> if you click always on top for that window, it will go OVER the panel
[23:24] <frustratedtech> but same issue on other monitor with the blank space
[23:24] <Cheri703> yeah
[23:25] <Cheri703> sooo...I might break something with this, so if I disappear, that's why
[23:25] <Cheri703> doing ppa-purge
[23:26] <Cheri703> I figure if I'm going to file a bug, I'll do it against the current version
[23:26] <frustratedtech> yes, it would be optimal
[23:28] <frustratedtech> frig.  now I got it so it wont do the space on the other monitor
[23:29] <frustratedtech> yet, it will still be above the expanded window
[23:32] <Cheri703> Yep, that for sure broke something
[23:32] <Cheri703> I'm on laptop now
[23:32] <Cheri703> trying to recover desktop >_<
[23:34] <frustratedtech> try this
[23:34] <frustratedtech> sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[23:35] <Cheri703> I did. it said "unmet dependencies" "recommend x program but not installed" and then stopped
[23:35] <Cheri703> so...yeah
[23:36] <Cheri703> something about held broken packages or something?
[23:36] <Cheri703> I'm trying to "repair broken packages" but my other thought is to install the 4.10 ppa and see if that sorts things out
[23:36] <Cheri703> once I give up on this
[23:55] <Cheri703> for the record, this is why I installed 4.12 in the first place: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/11/how-to-use-multiple-monitors-in-xubuntu.html
[23:57] <Unit193> http://xubuntu.org/news/faq-1204-precise/ Number 5.
[23:58] <Cheri703> yeah, but I wanted it natively, which 4.12 does
[23:58] <Cheri703> and apparently the same issue arises anyway! as far as panels
[23:59] <Cheri703> because if I'm telling it via arandr that it's one big screen, then I can understand it thinking it's a floating panel, if it's built in to xfce 4.12 that it is recognizing and treating as separate, then it should do what I want
[23:59] <Cheri703> so maybe I'll just go back to 4.12 and file the bug there
