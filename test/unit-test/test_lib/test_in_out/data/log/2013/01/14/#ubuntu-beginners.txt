[03:35] <kcoffman> Can someone help me with a sound issue?
[04:20] <yeehi> Quantal used to run v slowly in a Virtual Machine. Has this been fixed now? (It didn't have independent 2D)
[04:48] <holstein> kcoffman: whats up?
[04:49] <holstein> yeehi: "run v"?
[04:52] <kcoffman> holstein I didn't see your reply
[04:53] <kcoffman> holstein this is my problem I have a problem with the sound and volume control on my laptop. If the sound is below about 80% it's silent, when it's at 100% it's super loud and there is a very small window for a happy medium
[04:53] <holstein> kcoffman: have you tried with other operating systems?
[04:54] <kcoffman> no
[04:54] <kcoffman> holstein it worked with natty
[04:54] <holstein> kcoffman: natty is another operating system
[04:55] <kcoffman> holstein I know, I was thinking windows. sorry
[04:55] <holstein> kcoffman: i would just try and rule out a hardware issue... before you troubleshoot unecessarily software issues
[04:55] <holstein> kcoffman: could be a driver support issue.. there are typically a few things that can make or break audio support.. the kernel version and alsa version
[04:56] <holstein> kcoffman: i usually troubleshoot these with live CD's
[04:56] <kcoffman> holstein: How would you suggest I do that? I have already entered something in terminal that pulled up a volume equalizer and it didn't work
[04:56] <holstein> kcoffman: what i would suggest is to try alsamixer in the terminal.. dont trust the labels
[04:56] <holstein> then try pavucontrol, again not trusting labels
[04:57] <kcoffman> holstein ah a live CD, since I have switched to Ubuntu my CD/DVD burner works about 1 in 20 times I try to burn so i've given up on burning with this laptop
[04:57] <holstein> kcoffman: i'll just give you suggestions... use what you want
[04:57] <kcoffman> holstein I tired alsamixer in terminal
[04:58] <holstein> kcoffman: you can open a terminal and run a few commands.. lspci, aplay -l, arecord -l
[04:59] <holstein> in these outputs, you'll see the device... i would search "ubuntu model#" and see if anyone else has reported an issue
[04:59] <holstein> kcoffman: when trying alsamixer, you need to really tweak *everything* and trust no labels
[04:59] <kcoffman> holstein I ran the lspci...what am I looking for with this?
[04:59] <holstein> kcoffman: you are looking for the line that states what audio hardware you have... so you can search for help about it
[05:00] <holstein> kcoffman: have you appliced all upgrades?
[05:00] <holstein> applied*
[05:00] <kcoffman> Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation MCP51 High Definition Audio (rev a
[05:00] <kcoffman> holstein to my knowledge all upgrades are applied.
[05:01] <holstein> kcoffman: assume nothing.. open a terminal and run
[05:01] <holstein> sudo apt-get update
[05:01] <holstein> then... sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[05:01] <holstein> you can get a kernel or alsa upgrade that could fix (or break) your issue
[05:01] <holstein> !audio | kcoffman
[05:01] <ubot2`> kcoffman: If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[05:02] <holstein> kcoffman: i might just try another version... if you are runing 12.10, try 12.04... or viceversa
[05:02] <holstein> try and just get something supporting that hardware more "out of the box" til you are comfortable tracking these issues down
[05:03] <kcoffman> holstein I am running the update now
[05:03] <holstein> kcoffman: sometimes theres gain settings in the wrong place in alsamixer... or pavucontrol
[05:03] <holstein> kcoffman: i still dont know what hardware you have either
[05:04] <holstein> kcoffman: you can share the output of lscpi.. or aplay -l
[05:04] <holstein> !paste | kcoffman

[05:04] <kcoffman> holstein I have the NVIDIA MCP51..that's what it said for sound
[05:04] <holstein> it?
[05:05] <holstein> 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)
[05:05] <holstein> ^^ thats what im looking for
[05:08] <kcoffman> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1530020/
[05:09] <holstein> kcoffman: what operating system are you using?
[05:10] <holstein> kcoffman: you should have all kinds of output there.. front, center
[05:10] <kcoffman> 12.04
[05:11] <holstein> kcoffman: i would open either or both alsamixer or pavucontrol and dont trust the labels
[05:11] <kcoffman> what do you mean i should have all kinds of output there?
[05:11] <holstein> kcoffman: if its says "mic", you test that as a possible output
[05:11] <holstein> kcoffman: those labels are a guess sometimes
