[08:10] <ttoine> hello
[08:11] <ttoine> 10cm of snow here. the world around me is slow or still.
[08:15] <smartboyhw> len-1304, zequence ttoine how you guys doing???
[08:15] <ttoine> hello smartboyhw 
[08:17] <ttoine> here, it is snow white. and in a big french city, it means all is slow or still. it means it is hard to use a car,
[08:17] <smartboyhw> ttoine, how's Ubuntu Studio going these days?
[08:17]  * smartboyhw missed three weeks just for exam purpose
[08:17] <ttoine> for my part, I am doing a lot of tests with mixbus, and soon with lighworks
[08:18] <smartboyhw> Good
[08:18]  * smartboyhw goes download a new ISO for testing:P
[08:18] <ttoine> and I work with a small non profit studio in order to install this week a ubuntu studio workstation for audio production. I hope I will be able to make a kind of white paper
[08:18] <smartboyhw> !?
[08:19] <ttoine> smartboyhw, i saw that some work has been done with PA and jack
[08:19] <smartboyhw> ttoine, that's probably zequence's
[08:19] <smartboyhw> zequence, saw your kernel maintenance guide nice one
[08:20] <smartboyhw> ttoine, good post
[08:21] <smartboyhw> http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=12451911&postcount=52
[08:46] <ttoine> smartboyhw, very interesting.
[08:46] <smartboyhw> Interesting things are what we need
[08:47]  * smartboyhw goes to work on Xfce translations
[11:16] <zequence> smartboyhw: The kernel maintenance guide is not ready yet. Things have a way to not work as one expects, so I'll need to fill it with more info later on
[11:16] <smartboyhw> zequence, for my part is that the script cannot startnewrelease for me, it shows an error
[11:17] <zequence> smartboyhw: The script will only work, if there's something to update. But, there should be no error. Just a "everything is already up to date"
[11:18] <smartboyhw> zequence, I mean when there IS something to update:P
[11:18] <zequence> smartboyhw: The guide is not complete, so there might be some error
[11:19] <zequence> smartboyhw: If you want to understand how it all works, just study the script in detail
[11:19] <zequence> The commands are not that difficult. Most of it is just creating the variables for release tags, etc
[11:19] <smartboyhw> zequence, the problem is that it says there's no changelog in debian
[11:19] <zequence> And making sure the commits are pretty looking
[11:19]  * smartboyhw did read through the script
[11:19] <zequence> smartboyhw: You didn't do debian/rules clean
[11:20] <smartboyhw> zequence, hmm let me try again (I did do it however)
[11:20] <zequence> smartboyhw: If you did it, and had all the dependencies installed, you'd have a changelog
[11:21] <smartboyhw> zequence, ok. But I can't understand why we have to do the work in GitHub..... 
[11:23] <zequence> smartboyhw: It doesn't matter where it is. Probably we'll be uploading to PPA later, and have the packages built there. Then, they just sync from there
[11:23] <zequence> The important part is we get control of the source, and they are fine with how we do things
[11:23] <smartboyhw> :D
[11:25] <smartboyhw> zequence, so you actually did the last update wow:D
[11:26] <smartboyhw> zequence, the thing is that you should write a guide for updating metas (small work)
[11:26] <zequence> smartboyhw: I don't do the metas. They are done automatically somehow
[11:26] <smartboyhw> zequence, ooh
[11:26]  * smartboyhw doesn't know that
[11:27] <smartboyhw> sadly there are no new kernels, if not I would really want to try the guide once-out
[11:27] <zequence> smartboyhw: If you subscribe to bug reports for linux-lowlatency, you'll be notified of the next update
[11:28] <zequence> The bug doesn't have a version in the name initially. Once the source is uploaded, the bug name changes to include the version
[11:30] <smartboyhw> zequence, I will now:D
[11:31] <smartboyhw> Subscribed
[14:00] <Len-nb> smartboyhw, pulse is still getting fixed.It is not a done deal yet.
[14:05] <smartboyhw> Len-nb, ouch I just submitted a pass result in the QA Tracker for Cadence week 4
[14:06] <Len-nb> The test is simple
[14:07] <Len-nb> run audacious with some audio. Then start jack with qjackctl
[14:07] <Len-nb> Jack should still start.
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
[15:46] <ttoine> hop
[15:47] <ttoine> zequence, the 12.04 is far more light and stable than the 12.10
[15:47] <ttoine> and it seems that the nouveau driver is not so bad
[16:10] <zequence> ttoine: I haven
[16:11] <zequence> 't tried nouveau very much yet, but I know AMD free drivers are awesome
[16:11] <zequence> Except, the card gets hot
[16:12] <zequence> ttoine: I feel 12.04 is a bit lighter too, but I get the feeling they only do serious optimizations for the LTS releases
[16:48] <ttoine> zequence, I spoke with didrocks. He told me that the main aim for 13.04 is to make Ubuntu and Unity as light as possible for ARM and phones
[16:49] <ttoine> zequence, do you think it may cause a problem with a A4 or A6 AMD CPU + integrated GPU ? or only with pci cards ?
[16:50] <scott-work> ttoine: do you have any other items to report regarding helping your friend set up a studio?
[16:51]  * scott-work is going into a meeting now but will be back in thirty minutes (hopefully)
[16:52] <ttoine> scott-work, not at all
[16:52] <ttoine> is it boring ? or anoying ?
[17:11] <zequence> ttoine: Don't know. PCI is definately a problem. A friend of mine has two in crossfire, and we played some 3D games using the free drivers. All went well, until the cards got overheated
[17:11] <zequence> I told him not to use the free drivers any more after taht
[17:12] <zequence> From reading about it, it seemed like the free drivers can't regulate power to the cards, or something like that
[18:19] <scott-work> ttoine: "is it boring? or anoying?"...is that regarding my meeting? a scheduling meeting for three offices and two plants all across the US is certainly not boring but absolutely frustrating
[18:19] <scott-work> i'm just now back, btw
[18:20] <scott-work> part of the trouble is was the EOY and the holidays. we pushed so much work to the shops for the end of year but didn't complete those jobs as we normally would, but now we have the normal january work PLUS the left over from dec.
[18:25] <scott-work> ttoine: i am curious on how your installation went because i don't think we have enough documented experience with setting up a studio. i am very curious to where the opportunities lie for us to improve
[18:27] <ttoine> scott-work, oh, no.... my question is it boring or anoying was about your " do you have any other items to report regarding helping your friend set up a studio?" question
[18:28] <scott-work> i don't find it either boring or annoying, perhaps relieving but disappointing at the same time
[18:28] <scott-work> i'
[18:28] <ttoine> scott-work, one of my contact in Nantes, fr, is a guru of video production (live broadcast, films, etc.) and I hope he will help me to do the same for a video production workstation with cinelerra or lightworks
[18:29] <scott-work> ttoine: that would be incredibly informative :-D  i hope he helps as well
[18:29] <scott-work> ttoine: have you (or he) tried either blender or kdenlive for video?
[18:29] <scott-work> ttoine: and which version of cinelerra would you use? i believe there are two version
[18:30] <ttoine> scott-work, he tries everything. At the moment, he is considering that Open Shot, Blender and Cinellera are the most interessant floss
[18:30] <ttoine> scott-work, the community one is more stable
[18:30] <scott-work> ttoine: that is surprsing to hear that he views open shot more interesting that kdenlive
[18:30] <scott-work> s/that/than
[18:31] <ttoine> scott-work, he is interested by the open effects framework. too bad this is not supported by cinellera at the moment
[18:32] <scott-work> is that the ML-whatever it is called ?
[18:32] <scott-work> MLT
[18:32] <scott-work> kdenlive uses it as well i believe
[18:33] <ttoine> scott-work, and he already uses blackmagic gstreamer acceleration pci cards for some live video performance application. Scenic is one of the framework he is using. So for him, Pitivi, wich is based on gstreamer, would be a very good editor if it would be seriously developped
[18:35] <ttoine> scott-work, by the way, he is a sony vega demonstrator, and he know very well the r&d team of France Television, the french public tv and radio broadcasting company
[18:36] <ttoine> He knows so much about all that stuff... I hope I can get some of his time for us
[18:36] <zequence> ttoine: You should interview him about Ubuntu Studio, and put up some stuff. Sounds like a great resource, that guy
[18:36] <zequence> Or, just the apps he's using.
[18:37] <ttoine> zequence, yes
[18:37] <ttoine> we are not living in the same area, but when possible we have a drink a speak about all that
[18:54] <zequence> ttoine: Actually, we could probably do interviews on each other, since all of us use US for something
[18:54] <zequence> Would be nice to do that sometime
[18:55] <zequence> Do a series of interviews with the all the people involved in developing Ubuntu Studio
[18:55] <scott-work> ttoine: wow. i also hope you get some of his time. that would be incredible to get his feedback/knowledge/experience
[21:31] <zequence> Interesting link was posted on the jack mail list about a new audio server for Chrome OS, based on jack and pulseaudio https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/cras-chromeos-audio-server
[22:21] <len-1304> ttoine, I have found the  nouveau driver seems to have improved each new release. I do, however, have an older card.
[22:39] <ttoine> len-1304, I agree. Performance is quite goog now with the nouveau driver. The only difference is that with the nvidia driver, the image seems to look better when working on pictures or watching a film
