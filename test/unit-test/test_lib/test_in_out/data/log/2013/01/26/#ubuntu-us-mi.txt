[02:01] <brousch> I have no idea what search terms these people are using that they miss Grand Rapids Linux groups http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=12473629&postcount=55
[14:42] <snap-l> Good morning
[15:15] <rick_h_> party
[15:16] <rick_h_> snap-l: so glad to finally be mechanical?
[15:16] <rick_h_> took us a few years to get you there :P
[15:47] <snap-l> rick_h_: Yeah, it's actually quite nice.
[15:47] <snap-l> I think I don't even he soft landing pads
[15:48] <snap-l> they quiet down the keys, but they also get in the way.
[15:48] <snap-l> Yeah, I think I'm becoming more rick_h_ every day. ;)
[15:48]  * snap-l ordered that cat littler thing
[15:48] <snap-l> http://shop.littersystem.com/Litter-Quick-Litter-Box-and-Sifting-System-SP-0241.htm
[15:49] <snap-l> And also got pissed off at Target for a poorly done Free Shipping promition
[16:41] <Wolfger> Ugh. First reboot after Pangolin upgrade, and laptop doesn't want to start again, freezes pre-grub
[16:42] <Wolfger> finally got it to boot, but still didn't see grub. Dual booting is out the window? :-(
[16:43] <Wolfger> Google says this is not unheard of
[16:45] <Wolfger> and of course the wonderful people of Launchpad marked the bug "invalid".
[16:58] <snap-l> Lovely.
[17:10] <Wolfger> at least it seems to be fixed now, but why would you still be shipping 8 months later with a bug like that
[17:34] <jcastro> snap-l: if you're not doing shit this afternoon I am jill-less with many concerts
[17:56] <snap-l> jcastro: Nuts. I have some errands to run, and then dinner with my parents this evening.
[17:58] <jcastro> nuts indeed
