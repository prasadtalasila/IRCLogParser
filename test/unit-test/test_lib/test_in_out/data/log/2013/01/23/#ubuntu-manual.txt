[16:03] <CarstenG> Hi at all
[16:28] <cqfd93> Hi Carsten!
[16:45] <CarstenG> Hi Sylvie.
[16:46] <CarstenG> I think the French quantal version is nearly ready to publish
[16:46] <CarstenG> Kevin uploaded today the title page.
[16:57] <cqfd93> That's great news!
[16:58] <cqfd93> I haven't heard from Kevin about that, maybe he's too busy.
[18:40] <godbyk> CarstenG, cqfd93: The French quantal version has just been published. I just got the email that it passed review at CreateSpace.
[18:40] <godbyk> The PDFs are available on our website and the printed version is now available via CreateSpace.
[18:41] <godbyk> It should appear on Amazon soon.
[18:43] <godbyk> I also just published the Spanish translation of precise-e2.  The quantal edition will be available in the next week.
[18:44] <godbyk> It's nice to see such a variety of languages in the first dropdown list: http://ubuntu-manual.org/downloads
[18:47] <CarstenG> Hi Kevin
[18:47] <CarstenG> Great news!
[18:48] <CarstenG> This motivates a lot to work on the German translation further.
[18:51] <godbyk> CarstenG: Having the French translation team show you up like that? ;-)
[18:52] <godbyk> CarstenG: Even the Russians are ahead of you with precise-e2. :)
[18:52] <godbyk> Looking at the translation statistics, I'm quite excited to see how many translations are nearly complete!
[18:52] <godbyk> I may have to get a larger bookshelf if this keeps up!
[18:53] <CarstenG> yes... you are right... We are not really a lot people working on German.
[18:53] <CarstenG> At the moment I guess me and Daniel are the only two..
[18:54] <CarstenG> .And I can only make suggestions...
[18:59] <godbyk> CarstenG: Yeah, I think a lot of depends on how many translators you have helping.
[19:01] <CarstenG> Well, here you see our progress: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGermanTranslators/UbuntuManual
[19:04] <godbyk> CarstenG: Who does 'ich' refer to in the translator column?
[19:05] <CarstenG>  Ich = I
[19:05] <godbyk> I know that much.. but who is 'I'?
[19:05] <CarstenG> Its a placeholder, where a contributor can place his name.
[19:05] <godbyk> Ah, okay.
[19:05] <godbyk> I didn't know if it referred to a third translator who had created the wiki page or what.
[19:06] <CarstenG> No, Daniel Schury created the page.
[19:08] <cqfd93> Hi again, both!
[19:08] <cqfd93> Just announced the great news to the Frenct team
[19:09] <godbyk> cqfd93: Ah, excellent, Sylvie.  Be sure to thank them for me for all their hard work. And congratulations!
[19:11] <cqfd93> I already thanked them.  Thank you!
[19:11] <godbyk> I should have another couple translations of 12.10 published within the next week or so.
[19:12] <cqfd93> Are we the first team publishing 12.10?
[19:14] <godbyk> cqfd93: I think so.
[19:14] <godbyk> The Slovenian team is up next. And I think Spanish might be ready, too.
[19:15] <godbyk> cqfd93: Did you order a printed copy of 12.04e2 in French?  If so, how does it look?
[19:16] <cqfd93> I already received my copy of 12.04-e2: it looks great (too bad it is just black and white)
[19:17] <CarstenG> :-)
[19:17] <cqfd93> Several co-workers asked me to order it for them
[19:18] <CarstenG> Kevin, you see, the color version should become a option in future. :-)
[19:19] <godbyk> I could publish color editions easily enough.. I just don't want people to get confused when they search for our book and find that it costs $30.
[19:19] <godbyk> Let me see what the color edition would cost.. one moment.
[19:21] <godbyk> For the English edition of quantal, it looks like it would be about US$20.
[19:23] <CarstenG> As you know, I would upload both versions and let the user choose.
[19:24] <godbyk> CarstenG: That's what I'd do. I just want to make if obvious why the one is more expensive.
[19:26] <godbyk> I have to go to a meeting now. I'll be back in a couple hours.
[19:26] <godbyk> If I don't talk to you guys before then, I hope you see you at the meeting this weekend!
[19:27] <cqfd93> see you later Kevin!
[19:27] <CarstenG> How do they calculate the price? Do they count all pages for the color version, or only the pages which have really color and let the black/white pages at a lower price?
[19:27] <CarstenG> See you Kevin!
[19:30] <godbyk> They count all the pages the same (as color).
[19:30] <godbyk> see ya!
[20:50] <teolemon> i just reported this
[20:51] <teolemon> not sure whether it's in plans
[20:51] <teolemon> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual/+bug/1103679
[20:51] <manualbot> Launchpad bug 1103679 in ubuntu-manual "Broader distribution of Ubuntu Manual (Kindle Store, Google Play, iBookstore)" [Undecided,New]
[21:36] <godbyk> Hello, teolemon. Thanks for collecting those URLs. I'll check them out.
[21:37] <godbyk> teolemon: I would like to produce our manual in a few different e-book formats but I haven't had time to write the code to do that yet.
[21:37] <teolemon> now that we've finished the French translations
[21:37] <teolemon> we're preparing a media blitz
[21:37] <godbyk> Cool.
[21:37] <cqfd93> ;-)
[21:38] <godbyk> teolemon: Thanks for all your help with the French translation. It's a lot of work!
[21:38] <teolemon> and we want to get it out on the largest number of ways
[21:38] <godbyk> I'm going to submit it to the Ubuntu Software Center, too, but it tends to take quite some time before it shows up there.
[21:38] <teolemon> not English
[21:38] <teolemon> whatever
[21:38] <godbyk> (I think there are only a few reviewers for the Software Center and a lot of submissions.)
[21:39] <teolemon> and also, I was wondering about the ETA for the Ubuntu Software Centre
[21:39] <teolemon> ah ok
[21:39] <teolemon> it will need to use the private ppa/ purchase thingy
[21:39] <teolemon> for speed of publication reasons
[21:39] <teolemon> right ?
[21:40] <teolemon> we were wondering whether further pushing back the announcement to include software centre links
[21:40] <teolemon> or to move ahead without
[21:40] <godbyk> teolemon: I would go ahead without it.
[21:40] <godbyk> teolemon: The last manual I published through the Software Center took 2-3 months.
[21:40] <teolemon> eeek
[21:40] <godbyk> Yeah.
[21:41] <teolemon> that's a joke :-/
[21:41] <godbyk> I know that they're trying to improve the process, but right now it's quite slow.
[21:41] <godbyk> I submit the manual and then just wait.
[21:41] <teolemon> I hope they have a speedier process for Apps
[21:41] <godbyk> As far as I know, it's the exact same process.
[21:41] <teolemon> otherwise, Ubuntu will never get to be a premium platform for devs
[21:41] <teolemon> ...
[21:42] <godbyk> I'm going to look into creating a PPA for all of our manuals so that people can more easily install them in Ubuntu.
[21:42] <teolemon> not sure where they are installed afterwards
[21:42] <teolemon> is there a way to make a shortcut appear either in the launcher
[21:43] <teolemon> or on the desktop
[21:43] <godbyk> There is.
[21:43] <godbyk> When we install them through the Software Center currently, the files get installed to a subdirectory of /opt.
[21:43] <godbyk> And icons are installed in the dash.
[21:43] <teolemon> I'm also going to talk the French team into including it in the localised iso
[21:44] <godbyk> Cool.
[21:44] <teolemon> I think the AppStore submissions should be faster
[21:44] <teolemon> except perhaps for Apple
[21:44] <teolemon> that might go as far as rejecting it on ideological reasons
[21:44] <teolemon> (worth trying though)
[21:45] <godbyk> I'll look into it.
[21:46] <godbyk> I know that some e-book readers can handle PDFs, but I wouldn't want to send them a PDF that's designed for a full-sized piece of paper.
[21:46] <godbyk> I think the text would be too small on the e-book reader and the reader would have to zoom in all the time.
[21:46] <godbyk> So I'll have to see what size of PDF works best with those readers.
[21:46] <godbyk> I've started writing some code to convert our manuals to ePUB format, but that'll take a bit longer.
[21:50] <teolemon> yes
[21:50] <teolemon> the right way to do it
