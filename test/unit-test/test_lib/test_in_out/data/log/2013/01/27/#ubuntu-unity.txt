[12:59] <rye> Found why unity 2d had jagged edges on the Radiance theme - we are not drawing background for inactive items that's visible by cairo/pango, therefore it tries to antialias with something weird. Adding gtk_render_background before we render the entries makes labels look the way they are supposed to look.
[13:06]  * rye is talking about the fonts - http://ubuntuone.com/3Du1qgddWLHeHUdxXHY2ND
[13:14] <rye> Now I only hope that it's the same issue with Unity/Compiz
