[15:27] <Lionthinker> question: when I wipe and resintall Ubuntu and load by doc's through de ja dup, does U1 re up/down load docs? or does it recognise them as the same
[15:59] <rye> Lionthinker: if the file checksum has not changed, the files will not be uploaded/redownloaded
[15:59] <Lionthinker> rye, where do I find that?
[16:19] <karni> Lionthinker: What rye meant is, if the file has not changed since, the file content will not be reuploaded to (or redownloaded from) U1.
[16:20] <Lionthinker> karni, my files haven't changed but they still upload
[16:21] <karni> rye: ↑ Lionthinker, I doubt they are, but the UI may give you a wrong idication of "something happening"
[16:21] <Lionthinker> but i only placed my doc photos and vids back and not sys files
[16:22] <karni> Lionthinker: I don't know what "sys files" are, but I'll let support folks handle this :)
