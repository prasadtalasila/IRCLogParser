[09:35] <Fudge> amoma  what do you mean
[18:24] <robotfuel> is there a list of accessibility packages installed by default? 
[23:37] <Fudge> robotfuel  such as speech dispatcher gnome orca etc?
[23:37] <robotfuel> yes
[23:37] <robotfuel> Fudge: ^
[23:38] <Fudge> well yes they are installed out of the box
[23:38] <Fudge> are you new to ubuntu
[23:39] <robotfuel> no I want to know what they are so I have a list. I want to make sure I haven't missed any. 
[23:41] <Fudge> by default you would probably have to ask themuso or AlanBell 
[23:41] <Fudge> let me think though, speakup modules are in the kernel, orca is part of ubuntu-desktop meta package
[23:41] <Fudge> check ubuntu-desktop apt-cache show 
[23:43] <robotfuel> If I start with this https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Core, I want to make sure that all the default accessibility  apps are added back in. 
[23:56] <Fudge> for a project robotfuel ?
[23:57] <robotfuel> yes
[23:58] <Fudge> there wont be any accessibility support in core I doubt
[23:59] <Fudge> you would need to more than likely figure out your target audience and decide on a desktop from that
