[01:46] <skellat> How can somebody put a program on Soundcloud and it be unable to be processed by a bloody podcatcher?  I understand that there is Yet Another Ubuntu Podcast underway at http://ubuntu.audioca.st/ yet I cannot subscribe to it.
[01:48] <skellat> Grumble grumble grumble...I may need to contact somebody in the relevant LoCo and offer assistance perhaps...
[01:49] <skellat> Manual downloads without a generally available announcer other than UWN is not cool

[02:27] <jrgifford> skellat: putting real podcasts up is difficult.
[02:27] <jrgifford> everything either costs lots of money (hosted solutions) or slightly less money (self-run solutions)
[14:50] <thafreak> canthus13: normally, I wouldn't do a CCNA at this point....
[14:51] <thafreak> but there's potentially a full time faculty position at akron, which requires it
[14:51] <thafreak> since they're part of the cisco academy, they want you to have the cert you're training people to get
[14:52] <thafreak> I figure a bit of studying and a one time test fee would be worth it to be eligible for a gig like that
[14:52] <thafreak> I'm the only part-time person they have with an lpic-2 I think, so I'd probably be a shoe in
[14:53]  * canthus13 nods.
[14:53] <canthus13> thafreak: I ran into that CCNA instructor at home depot last night. :P
[14:53] <thafreak> I normally also wouldn't probably pursue an lpic-3...since it's mostly irrelevant to me
[14:53] <thafreak> haha
[14:54] <thafreak> was he cutting network cable for people?
[14:54] <thafreak> or counting screws
[14:55] <thafreak> also, I don't endorse buying network cable from the depot...or lowes either
[14:55] <thafreak> they sell 250mhz rated cable as cat-6...
[14:55] <thafreak> the cat-5e I usually get is rated at 350mhz...
[14:55] <canthus13> thafreak: He was cutting keys for me.
[14:55] <thafreak> haha
[14:55] <thafreak> did you crack wise?
[14:56] <canthus13> Nope. He's a brilliant guy.. Just old. He's prolly 70-75 now.
[14:57] <thafreak> oh holy cow
[14:57] <thafreak> surprised he's not a walmart greeter
[14:58] <thafreak> well, I guess the more technically advanced would rather work at the depot
[15:04] <canthus13> Heh.
[19:42] <thafreak> wow, 3tb drives are coming down in price finally...
[19:42] <thafreak> probably cause of the latest 4tb drives out now
[19:42] <thafreak> a 3tb WD Red drive is only $140
[19:42] <thafreak> I think I paid like $119 for my 2tb red drives just a month or so ago

[19:57] <thafreak> wow...newegg has one of those dualcore android "stick" pc's for $60...
[19:58] <thafreak> if you haven't seen one, they resemble a usb "stick"...only instead of a usb-A male end, it's an hdmi male end
[21:04] <Unit193> skellat: Tried Keryx?
[21:37] <skellat> Unit193: What is it and what is it for?
[21:38] <skellat> The fast search in Yahoo brought up a pharmaceutical firm
[21:39] <Unit193> skellat: It is a program for linux, and it has to do with offline updates.  https://launchpad.net/keryx
[21:39] <Unit193> Their site doesn't appear to be online right now.
[21:40] <skellat> Nope
[21:40] <skellat> It looks like an abandoned project needing forking perhaps
[21:41] <skellat> apt-offline is at least under active development within Debian
[21:42] <skellat> And apt itself has gone in new directions since 2011 with the architecture field being added into play which wasn't around when Keryx last punched a release out
[21:43] <skellat> And looking at their code, it is hard-coded by release which means it sees the world stopping with Karmic Koala
[21:43] <Unit193> I wasn't sure if you'd used it before, but while it is outdated, looks interesting.
[21:44] <skellat> Yeah, never used it.  Only apt-offline and did a hideous hack beforehand
[21:44] <Unit193> apt-offline would still be good, more so since synaptic has been removed from everything.  Synaptic has actually been updated for GTK3, so may be useful yet.
[21:46] <skellat> Is synaptic still being updated upstream?  I've held everybody in the family to Precise Pangolin so we all still have it and it is enforced in erielooking-settings if memory serves.
[21:48] <Unit193> Synaptic is in quantal, but I'm thinking the updated code is only in launchpad.
[21:49] <skellat> Well...if we really, really want to go light-weight...we should bring back aptitude...
[21:49] <paultag> Canonical doesn't care
[21:49] <paultag> they have the software store
[21:49] <paultag> granted it's nongnu
[21:50] <paultag> but some canonical'er maintained it iirc
[21:50] <paultag> and it was pretty much EOL'd in 2009
[21:50] <skellat> That's Ubuntu, we're thinking of Xubuntu
[21:50] <Unit193> I like the apt-get/apt-cache commands, but if I had to use a GUI it'd be synaptic.
[21:50] <paultag> ah yeah, mvo
[21:50] <paultag> I made a post saying it was going away and people tried to tell me I was wrong
[21:50] <paultag> I wasn't
[21:51] <Unit193> Ubuntu Software Center is default in Xubuntu as well, though.
[21:51] <skellat> True
[21:51] <Unit193> Not on mine! :D
[21:52] <skellat> I got it but haven't removed it yet...just haven't felt up to it
[21:52] <paultag> I just had to purge it
[21:52] <paultag> for some reason my mom couldn't use it to install something
[21:52] <Unit193> Purged it a long time ago.
[21:52] <paultag> and it was trying to sell her something
[21:52] <paultag> and I got really pissed off and ditched it, fast.
[21:52] <Unit193> Anyway, https://code.launchpad.net/~synaptic-developers/
[21:53] <paultag> yeah, that's just mvo, Unit193
[21:53] <paultag> who's now Canonical, iirc
[21:53] <paultag> which I don't :(
[21:53] <Unit193> paultag: Better than nothing, best GUI there is.
[21:53] <paultag> Unit193: the software store?
[21:53] <Unit193> I linked to Synaptic.
[21:54] <paultag> I'm saying
[21:54] <paultag> he's not actively working on it iirc
[21:54] <Unit193> last commit was 2013-01-04
[21:54] <Unit193> evfool did that one.
[21:55] <paultag> Unit193: but look at the history
[21:55] <paultag> it's sparse
[21:55] <Unit193> A little, yes.
[21:56] <Unit193> Only recent update was pretty much for GTK3.
[21:56] <skellat> And with 4 branches pending for merge
[21:56] <paultag> aye
[21:57] <Unit193> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~synaptic-developers/synaptic/trunk/view/head:/debian/changelog  0.75.12 in quantal, so I still think it's better than USC, but that's more design than commit history.
[21:58] <Unit193> My point is, it's not quite dead, just very slow.
[21:59] <skellat> Oh the things to be liberated if only there were the resources to back such up
[22:00] <paultag> aye
[22:03] <skellat> Unit193: So I understand you to say that the updated synaptic is in raring?
[22:03] <Unit193> Grrrr, you're there too.
[22:03] <Unit193> skellat: Yes.
[22:03]  * Unit193 was going to slip out of here.
[22:04] <skellat> Oh the joys of having a working IRC bouncer
[22:04] <Unit193> Yeah, now you're watching me. :P
[22:05] <skellat> :-)
