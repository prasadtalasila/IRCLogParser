[00:21] <jrgifford> Cheri703: the i5 is definitely the minimum.
[00:22] <Cheri703> I was eyeing some hefty amd ones that were the same/cheaper than i5 :/
[00:22] <jrgifford> although i'm seriously considering just getting a rackmount monster next time, and just virtualize everything.
[00:22] <jrgifford> instead of a proper desktop.
[00:23] <Cheri703> I will probably just wait and think about it forever until I *have* to buy something :/
[00:23] <jrgifford> well,true.
[00:23] <jrgifford> that's also an option. and that's what i'm doing.
[18:01] <canthus13> paultag: ping
[18:46] <paultag> canthus13: pong, but I'm really busy
[18:46] <paultag> what's up
[18:46] <paultag> @ the MIT hunt, puzzling hard, day 2
[18:57] <canthus13> Ah.  Just curious as to this whole 'sinking ship' panic I'm hearing about over debian.  apparently the dpkg maintainer left?
[19:45] <dzho> looks like it's team-maintained http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/dpkg
[19:59]  * canthus13 nods.
[22:05] <jrgifford> canthus13 wait, what? the dpkg maintainer is gone?
[22:07] <canthus13> that's what I"m hearing.
[22:07]  * canthus13 shrugs.
[22:09] <jrgifford> were
[22:09] <jrgifford> i can't find anything
[22:16] <canthus13> Meh. Looks like someone's starting rumors. apparently someone abandoned debian for alpine and things got a bit wild...
[22:17] <jrgifford> i've never been able to use alpine, so i guess i'm ok with that.
[22:17] <canthus13> heh.
[23:58] <skellat> Cheri703: Is it possible to formally announce meeting date?  I'm trying to get the script together for Burning Circle 98 so that I can announce something.
[23:59] <Cheri703> uhm, let's go for wednesday at 7pm. do you want to send out the announcement like last time?
