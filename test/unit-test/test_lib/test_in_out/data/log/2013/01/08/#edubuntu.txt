[19:14] <highvoltage> stgraber: do you think we should delay alpha 2 to match up with kubuntu? also, do you think it's likely that the edubuntu server squashfs will be installable by then?
[19:14] <highvoltage> (around Feb 8-10 it seems)
[19:15] <stgraber> highvoltage: I don't have any problem with delaying. Not sure about the server squashfs, we'll see
[19:15] <highvoltage> stgraber: is there a bug list to-do list for that? if not, could we talk about it some time like tonight so that you could walk me through it?
[19:33] <stgraber> highvoltage: no fine grained todo list. Currently the only bit that's really functional is the user interface, so on that side, the only thing that's left I believe is implementing the overview page
[19:34] <stgraber> my idea is to list the role (primary group) and the list of groups the user is a member of and a link to the password change page
[19:34] <stgraber> that's probably as much as we'll want to show to a standard user in the first release of edubuntu server
[19:34] <stgraber> the rest will be in the admin UI
