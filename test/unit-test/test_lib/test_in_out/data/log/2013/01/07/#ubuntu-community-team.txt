[02:46] <mhall119> cjohnston: I don't know if it has a separate one
[02:47] <cjohnston> mhall119: at one time we were going to make one for each site so that there was a file a bug link on every page

[22:42] <jcastro> I have 3 monitors, one for windows, 2 for unity.
[22:42] <imbrandon> ahh
[22:43] <jcastro> synergy to connect them all as "one" desktop
[22:43]  * imbrandon was watching your rock band bass thing
[22:43] <imbrandon> so i saw 4 , one must have been for something else
[22:44] <mhall119> it's for ambient lighting
[22:44] <imbrandon> but yea i love synergy
[22:45] <jcastro> I have one on there
[22:45] <imbrandon> i have all 4 of mine hooked to the Mac mini atm, but sometimes I hook one head to the Ubuntu box under my desk and use synergy then
[22:45] <jcastro> a fourth one, but it's not connected to anything right now
[22:45] <imbrandon> ahhh , those usb-to-dvi display adapters i brought to UDS rock
[22:46] <imbrandon> if you want to not add a new video card
[22:46] <imbrandon> full res on upto 30inch displays
[22:46] <jcastro> I need new PCs, these are getting long in the tooth
[22:46] <jcastro> I have them in the closet
[22:46] <jcastro> and then run cables
[22:46] <imbrandon> nice :)
[22:47] <imbrandon> i need to clean up my office and take some new pics of the setup, its changed quite alot
[22:47] <imbrandon> added a new EE bench ( for Adruino hacking and such )
[22:48] <imbrandon> was all on my desk but keyboards and soldering irons dont mix well, 2nd or 3rd time i burned my hand reaching over to type on the keyboard i went to home depot and got supplies to build a new bench that day
[22:48] <imbrandon> hahah
[22:51] <imbrandon> mhall119: hahaha
[23:02] <daker> cjohnston: http://youtu.be/xEF0MVjrs5k
[23:15] <imbrandon> daker: thats awesome
[23:16] <daker> imbrandon: btw omg does work without httpseverywhere
[23:16] <imbrandon> yes
[23:16] <imbrandon> perfectly
[23:16] <daker> (y)
[23:17] <imbrandon> that extension borks on cloudfront cdn's
[23:17] <imbrandon> it redirects images and css to the wrong urls
[23:19] <daker> i see
[23:20] <imbrandon> daker: e.g. try to hit http://cloudfront.omgubuntu.co.uk/ with it installed
[23:20] <imbrandon> ( and without )
[23:20] <daker> with : https://omgubuntu.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
[23:21] <imbrandon> right, and that bucket does not contain a mirror of the site
[23:21] <imbrandon> well not a full one, not sure where the extension is getting that url from but its actually not supose to be a published url
[23:22] <imbrandon> dont happen to know the ext authors do you ? heh
[23:22] <daker> imbrandon: ok
[23:25] <daker> imbrandon: the adress is here chrome-extension://gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp/rules/default.rulesets
[23:25] <daker> i can se omg
[23:25] <daker> see*
[23:25] <imbrandon> ahh so the author added it ?
[23:26] <daker> <ruleset f="OMG-Ubuntu.xml" name="OMG! Ubuntu! (partial)"><target host="cloudfront.omgubuntu.co.uk"/><rule from="^https?://cloudfront\.omgubuntu\.co\.uk/" to="https://omgubuntu.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/"/>
[23:26] <imbrandon> right, there is a partial mirror at that url but not a full one so that rule needs to be removed
[23:27] <imbrandon> infact that mirror will be gone completely soon
[23:28] <imbrandon> yea i dont have it installed , i probably should add it to my chrome canary
[23:29] <daker> imbrandon: bug report should be reported there https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&groupdesc=1&group=type&max=200&component=EFF-HTTPS+Everywhere&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&report=19
[23:29] <imbrandon> daker: ty
[23:30] <daker> imbrandon: yw
[23:32] <imbrandon> funny thing is things like https://cloudfront.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/reeb.jpg work :) not sure why they picked that one mirror of many
[23:34] <imbrandon> daker: i dont see a way to actually report bugs, must i signup for an account to do so ?
[23:36] <daker> yeah you should register on trac
[23:36] <daker> imbrandon: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/register
[23:36] <imbrandon> k got it , ty
[23:37] <daker> and the report should be against "EFF-HTTPS Everywhere" component
[23:37] <imbrandon> k
[23:52] <imbrandon> daker: I may have to get Joey to file the bug, seems I cant even sign up for an account on their tracker http://f.cl.ly/items/460r111r3j2q0L1X2a0a/tor%20trac.png
[23:53] <imbrandon> pops up for a login to create a login :)
[23:53] <daker> imbrandon: or just contact contact someone from EFF
[23:53] <imbrandon> kk
