[01:07] <Scunizi> I am trying to rip cd's using Dolphin and its built in ability.

[01:20] <timberwolf> My cursor freezes after log in on a non root account
[01:20] <timberwolf> how do I fix this?
[01:35] <timberwolf> anybody?
[01:37] <user94202> Question about the KDE menu.   How do I arrange the games in alphabetical order?
[01:37] <user94202> i have over 100 games but I want the listed alphabetically .
[01:45] <chemtail> network management was working fine two days ago, i turn off the laptop, come home and plug it in, and network manager never seems to send dhcp requests any more
[01:45] <chemtail> i can do 'dhclient eth0' just fine manually, everything works, but the network manager widget just hangs there in the connecting state forever
[01:46] <chemtail> which is really annoying with things like pidgin with built-in NM support, because it flat out refuses to connect to anything as long as it's in that state
[01:46] <chemtail> any ideas how I fix this?
[01:46] <chemtail> already tried removing and re-adding the widget, restarting the underlying services, even rebooting.  nada.
=== nosrepa is now known as aperson
[01:50] <user94202> chemtail:  Maybe add "dhclient eth0" to one of your startup scripts
[01:50] <user94202> at the end of the bootup process somewhere.
[01:50] <frogonwheels> chemtail: has the network manager got stuck as 'disabled' ?
[01:51] <chemtail> frogonwheels: nope.  i've tried disabling and re-enabling it a few times just in case, though.
[01:51] <chemtail> user94202: i've considered a few hackarounds like that, but i'd really, really rather not use them
[01:52] <chemtail> it's an ugly fix.
[01:52] <chemtail> and much as i hate network manager, it's unfortunately the default/standard, so i'd rather just fix it so the setup i have now will work elsewhere later
[01:52] <frogonwheels> chemtail: look in cat /var/run/network/   for stuff
[01:53] <frogonwheels> erm ign th cat.. but you know what i mean
[01:53] <chemtail> not much there :|
[01:57] <user94202> Question 2:   How do I make "Applications" the first TAB in the menu  (NOT favourites).
[01:58] <timberwolf> My cursor freezes after log in on a non root account, how do I fix this?
[02:01] <user94202> timberwolf..  I had my cursor dissapear so i removed "unclutter" and fixed the problem.  sudo apt-get remove unclutter
[02:02] <user94202> or possibly adjust settings in power management
[02:02] <timberwolf> let me try that.
[02:02] <timberwolf> it said it wasn't installed
[02:03] <timberwolf> I have kubuntu 12.10
[02:03] <user94202> ok.. Looks like a different cause then
[02:03] <timberwolf> it is there I just can't move it.
[02:04] <user94202> is the system frozen or just the pointer only?
[02:04] <timberwolf> just the pointer
[02:04] <timberwolf> I have to use the keyboard to log out.
[02:05] <timberwolf> But when I log in as root my cursor works fine
[02:05] <timberwolf> I tried creating a new account to see if it was just that account, but it locked up too

=== vorian is now known as V
[02:09] <Timberwolf> any other Ideas?
[02:15] <user94202> Timbewolf,  did the mouse pointer always freeze from the time you installed kubuntu?
[02:15] <Timberwolf> no
[02:15] <user94202> at what point did it start freezing?  Recall what you did?
[02:16] <Timberwolf> it happened right after closing EVE Online in wine
[02:16] <Timberwolf> at first I thought it was just my main account
[02:17] <Timberwolf> but it turned out all non root acounts after I did some tests
[02:17] <Timberwolf> I removed my main account and readded it first
[02:17] <Timberwolf> then I created an account with a whole new name
[02:18] <quesada> any way to do a drag lock? Using a trackball to scroll
[02:18] <quesada>  I'd like to program a button to lock the ball in scroll mode
=== quesada is now known as urlwolf
[02:20] <user94202> Timberwolf, since it froze from the time you played eve online,   did you install anything that might have corrupted the system?
[02:20] <Timberwolf> no
[02:21] <Timberwolf> I closed the eve client and as it was closing I was able to move my mouse 50 pixals or so then it just freezes
[02:22] <Timberwolf> and when I log in it freezes after about 1 second
[02:24] <user94202> hmm..who knows?   I would run a dependancy check on my system with "sudo apt-get check" or possibly remove the whole wine subsystem..
[02:24] <Timberwolf> I tried the removing wine thing, no luck
[02:25] <Timberwolf> root@PAT-PC:~# apt-get check
[02:25] <Timberwolf> Reading package lists... Done

[02:27] <Timberwolf> thats all it said
[02:28] <user94202> Timberwolf... could be anything...Any experts here??  Disk errors can cause random problems with the desktop so I run a disk check (use a live cd for that).
[02:30] <Timberwolf> ok
[02:32] <user94202> Timberwolf,  process of elimination i suppose to pinpoint the problem.
[02:33] <user94202> sudo dpkg --configure -a      (perhaps??)
[02:33] <user94202> make sure desktop isn't locked???
[02:33] <Timberwolf> I am going to try running a disk check from the hard drive
[02:43] <Timberwolf> Pass completed, 1 bad blocks found. (1/0/0 errors)

[07:01] <user94202> How do I enable random screensavers.  All I get is black screen.
[07:04] <user94202> also OpenGL for effects rendering crashes the system
[07:06] <sbivol> user94202: you probably have some issues with the fraphics driver
[07:06] <sbivol> what video card are you using?
[07:07] <sbivol> s/fraphics/graphics
[07:08] <user94202> Video card:  GeForce4 MX 440 AGP 8x   (I'm using open source driver included with kubuntu).
[07:10] <user94202> Interesting...When I set the screensave to enable in 1 minute it works fine.  But 15minutes gives me a black screen.
[07:12] <user94202> < Set screensaver to start in 9 minutes.  waiting...
[07:17] <sbivol> user94202: Try switching the compositing backend to XRender from OpenGL
[07:17] <sbivol> some effects will work then
[07:19] <OerHeks> user94202, check energy saving > dim display
[07:20] <sbivol> user94202: if I'm not mistaken, your card might not support OpenGL 2 and KWin is not happy to run with  OpenGL 1. I could be wrong, but anyway, try XRender
[07:22] <user94202> Yes i selected xrender as it refused to use openGL anyway.  I lost my transparent taskbar and random screensavers.
[07:23] <user94202> OerHeks, I have "dim display" disabled
[07:24] <user94202> As stated, it could be a conflict with my old video card.  But if i can get random xscreensavers working that's fine.
[07:25] <user94202> I don't like a black screensaver because it looks like the PC has shutdown.  (prefer random animations).
[07:42] <user94202> random screensavers now work with 9 minutes delay.

[09:56] <azrael_> Hi, Could anyone help me? Because I've a Atheros AR9285 Wireless controller, which has some signal power problems, I had to use the compat wireless driver. I  installed this group di drivers but the problems are not solved and the VGA drivers don't work! In fact the resolution is low and I think there are some problems loading the relative module.

[10:30] <Kalidarn> is it possible to use Ayatana in KDE?
[10:30] <Kalidarn> or is there a proper way to do this native to KDE (not using the Ayatana scrollbars project)
[10:31] <Kalidarn> I really miss those minimalistic, bars that I have on my mac
[10:38] <Wizard> Kalidarn: You can either look for Qt theme with such scrollbars, or edit Oxygen properties.
[10:39] <Wizard> It is possible to make scrollbars thinner for sure, I bet you can also disable arrows.
[10:39] <Kalidarn> yeah i think that's what is required
[10:39] <Wizard> Start with Oxygen props.
[10:45] <soie> how can i record a video on my desktop?

[14:25] <jeroen-> Sorry if this question is asked 1 million times, but: Is Kubuntu now supported by Canonical or Blue Systems?
[14:25] <jeroen-> On the Kubuntu website I still see Canonical
[14:32] <BluesKaj> jeroen-, Blue Systems
[14:33] <jeroen-> BluesKaj:  OK thanks, but why do I still read Canonical on the website?
[14:36] <BluesKaj> jeroen-, probly because the ubuntu core is still canonical , and bluesystems supports kubuntu , which is the ubuntu core with the kde desktop ...it's more complex than that , but simply put that's the best description I can think of.

[14:45] <OerHeks> You might want to choose by support :-)

[14:46] <OerHeks> Large active community support yes

[14:47] <jeroen-> OerHeks:  so the kubuntu community is bigger as mintkde?
[14:48] <jeroen-> than
[14:48] <OerHeks> Yes, i think so.
[14:48] <OerHeks> but hey, try it and investigate what is working good for you
[14:50] <jeroen-> OerHeks:  they both look good
[14:50] <BluesKaj> jer , judging from the linuxmint chat population then kubuntu has over 5 times the support population
[14:50] <BluesKaj> jeroen-,^
[14:50] <jeroen-> Let me ask the same question in the mintkde chat ;)
[14:51] <OerHeks> my best advise, also with ubuntu desktops, install side/by/side
[14:51] <BluesKaj> jeroen-, I can imagine what the reaction will be :)

[16:38] <yossarianuk> is kde 4.9.5 coming to the kubuntu ppa ?
[16:39] <jessie> Which PPA?
[16:39] <jessie> Because I already have 4.9.5
[16:39] <yossarianuk> the latest stable opne

[16:51] <Basil1x> OK... more weirdness involving sound.  12.10.  Says I have removed my CONEXANT sound card, and do I want to remove the drivers for it, This is a laptop, and I have done no such thing.  After this, though, the sound obviously does not work.  Is this an 'open the case' issue, or a software fix?
[16:51] <DarthFrog> Basil1x:  Likely it's pulseaudio taking control.
[16:52] <Basil1x> OK.  but the sound does not work.
[16:53] <Basil1x> I do not care what controls the audio, only that I have it.
[16:53] <DarthFrog> Pulse is great when it works.  Pulse is a PITA when it doesn't.
[16:54] <Basil1x> Lovely.  Is there a fix?  or am I to be forever rebooting for the ~25min-1hr of blessed sound it allows me?
[16:55] <Basil1x> This just started a week or so ago
[16:55] <DarthFrog> What happens at that time?
[16:55] <Basil1x> nothing at all.  Just installed the regular upgrades.
[16:56] <DarthFrog> And it deletes the sound card drivers?
[16:56] <Basil1x> Have tried a fresh install since, which did *not* improve things
[16:56] <DarthFrog> Until you reboot?
[16:56] <Basil1x> I told it not to, and to quit asking
[16:56] <DarthFrog> Well, you could try installing pavucontrol and use that to set your output device, etc.
[16:56] <Basil1x> yes until I reboot
[16:56] <DarthFrog> Odd.
[16:57] <Basil1x> Yes, odd... and demmed irritating
[16:57] <Basil1x> lemme see... pavucontrol, you say.
[16:58] <DarthFrog> It's what I use.
[16:59] <Basil1x> already installed
[16:59] <DarthFrog> Then run it. :-)
[17:00] <Basil1x> It insists all is right with the world
[17:01] <Basil1x> but then, for now, I have sound
[17:01] <Basil1x> should I break the sound, and then run it again?  Easily done... all I hafta do is sit and wait.
[17:02] <jessie> So, I guess no one saw my question earlier, so I'll ask again: I installed mysql yesterday and now Akonadi is refusing to start. I get this error: http://paste.kde.org/636596/
[17:04] <Basil1x> jessie: do you run bleachbit?
[17:04] <BluesKaj> Basil1x, which soundcard ?
[17:04] <Basil1x> bcos it looks like you've removed the .conf file to me
[17:05] <Basil1x> CONEXANT sound card
[17:05] <jessie> I've checked the .conf file. It's there.
[17:05] <jessie> Contents of mysql.conf file: http://paste.kde.org/636662/
[17:05] <BluesKaj> Basil1x, which audio chip is listed in alsamixer at the upper left ?
[17:06] <Basil1x> HDA Intel PCH
[17:10] <BluesKaj> Basil1x, try adding your audio driver with root permissions , to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf , 'options snd-hda-intel index=0' , without the quotes . This should solidify your alsa module settings on the next reboot.
[17:12] <Basil1x> BluesKaj: Should that go top or bottom of the options?
[17:13] <BluesKaj> Basil1x, just at the bottom of file is sufficient
[17:14] <BluesKaj> it makes the hda kernel module the default (card0)
[17:14] <Basil1x> Won't save
[17:15] <BluesKaj> open it with root permissions
[17:16] <Basil1x> so sudo kate it?
[17:17] <BluesKaj> sudo nano in the terminal or kdesudo kate in the krunner (alt+f2)
[17:17] <Wizard> kdesudo is better ;)
[17:17] <Wizard> (for GUI apps)
[17:19] <Basil1x> fabulous.  Now I should reboot, and try to break the sound?
[17:20] <diawara> hepl , I want to use Linux MCE
[17:20] <DarthFrog> diawara:  Then go to #Linux-MCE channel.
[17:21] <DarthFrog> This channel is for Kubuntu support.
[17:21] <Basil1x> brb
[17:21] <diawara> can you tell me how to instal un softwar
[17:22] <DarthFrog> diawara:  sudo apt-get remove <package name>
[17:22] <DarthFrog> Or use the Muon GUI.
[17:22] <diawara> DarthFrog  :can you tell me how to instal un softwar
[17:22] <DarthFrog> I just did.
[17:22] <diawara> i think its install
[17:23] <DarthFrog> Oh, install, not uninstall. :-)   Replace "remove" with "install" in the apt-get command.
[17:23] <DarthFrog> diawara: You can use the "apt-cache search <string>" to find package names.
[17:24] <Basil1x> OK... rebooted... now to try to break the sound
[17:25] <DarthFrog> Basil1x:  A good bout of percussive maintenance should do that.  :-)
[17:25] <diawara> DarthFrog :   ok LET ME TRY
[17:25] <diawara> DarthFrog  : IM COME
[17:25] <BluesKaj> or sudo modprobe sn-hda-intel

[17:29] <BluesKaj> GOOGLE diawara
[17:29] <Basil1x> seems to be working... will know in an hour.  that's when the sound usually fails
[17:29] <Wizard> No, I need to handle two IMAP accounts, BluesKaj :)
[17:30] <diawara> I'm mean use or instal
[17:30] <BluesKaj> sending or receiving Wizard?
[17:30] <Wizard> Both.
[17:30] <DarthFrog> Basil1x:  if sound fails, check the logs.  /var/log/messages, /var/log/kern.log & /var/log/syslog is where I'd start looking.
[17:30] <BluesKaj> can't thunderbird handle IMAP accts ?
[17:31] <DarthFrog> Yes it can.
[17:31] <Wizard> Yes, but I don't like it :/
[17:31] <DarthFrog> I've been using Gmail IMAP with Tbird for years.

[17:32] <Basil1x> DarthFrog: Thanks.  Will do.  Will also buy an I dentical computer to this and see if it's a Toshiba problem. <I need another Laptop, anyway ;) >
[17:33] <BluesKaj> kmail/akonadi is too buggy on my system ..T-Bird handle 4 email accts here without a hitch including gmail/IMAP
[17:33] <DarthFrog> Basil1x:   And if the second one has the same problem?  Then you've got two unsatisfactory systems.
[17:34] <Wizard> Hair shirts? :D
[17:34] <BluesKaj> itchy as hell and uncomfortable
[17:34] <Basil1x> DarthFrog: No... then I pop the original HDD back in, and return it :D
[17:34] <Wizard> BluesKaj: Akonadi is awful. Kmail was such a nice email client. And now? Every update does magic to my imap accounts.
[17:35] <BluesKaj> does magic ?
[17:35] <Wizard> Yeah, clones of my mailboxes appear and disappear and so.
[17:35] <DarthFrog> I gave up on Kmail due to its inability to properly handle HTML mail.
[17:35]  * Basil1x is good at returning things to stores
[17:35] <BluesKaj> ahh evil magic
[17:36] <Wizard> Yup.
[17:41] <kristjan> hello friends
[17:42] <kristjan> one newbe here tryng to merge 3 avi files into 1 file
[17:42] <kristjan> mencoder installed and useing terminal
[17:43] <kristjan> can anybody help me go thru this pain
[17:43] <kristjan> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=337234
[17:43] <kristjan> here is the instructions
[17:43] <kristjan> so i am ready
[17:44] <kristjan> if anyone is bored , plese help me
[17:45] <jdrs> easier way is to get ffmpeg, convert your .avi files to .mpg, then use cat command to concatenate them then convert the merged .mpg file to .avi
[17:45] <kristjan> yeah
[17:46] <kristjan> very easy for newbe
[17:46] <kristjan> is there any app that makes life easyer?
[17:47] <kristjan> i have problems with kdenlive
[17:51] <Wizard> What problems?
[17:53] <Basil1x> kristjan: I have had good results with mkvmerge GUI
[17:54] <Basil1x> kdenlive is a memory hog
[17:55] <kristjan> Basil1 where can i get that?
[17:56] <Basil1x> it's in the repositories...
[17:57] <Basil1x> make sure the avis are the same size and use the same audio before you use it, though, or else you'll have issues.
[17:58] <Basil1x> which, if you're trying to merge them, they should be already :)
[17:58] <kristjan> same size?
[17:59] <Basil1x> as in the video has the same aspect ratio and pixel number... like 640x480, or 640x360
[18:01] <kristjan> ok
[18:02] <Basil1x> Width height framerate and codec must all be the same :)
[18:02] <kristjan> yes they should be same
[18:03] <Basil1x> then you're laughing.
[18:03] <Basil1x> be sure to, after you add the files, join them
[18:04] <Basil1x> use 'append' rather than 'add
[18:04] <kristjan> i messed up my first try but will see whats gonna hapend now
[18:06] <kristjan> Error: The track number 1 from the file '/home/kristjan/Desktop/MOV_0123.avi' cannot be appended to the track number 1 from the file '/home/kristjan/Desktop/MOV_0121.avi'. The track parameters do not match.
[18:07] <Basil1x> OK... you've got either a codec difference, or an audio difference... run the files through Handbrake and make them identical first. :)
[18:10] <kristjan> dimentions are the same
[18:10] <Basil1x> are the audio properties the same?  Track 1 is usually audio
[18:11] <kristjan> bitrate is different
[18:13] <Basil1x> OK... I'd recommend Handbrake... does a fast, good job remuxing files. in terminal: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases
[18:13] <kristjan> i have it installed
[18:13] <Basil1x> then sudo apt-get update
[18:13] <Basil1x> and install handbrake :)
[18:14] <kristjan> i installed it last week
[18:14] <Basil1x> ah
[18:14] <Basil1x> excellent
[18:14] <kristjan> yeah
[18:14] <kristjan> hope i can use it after this chat
[18:15] <kristjan> i know how to use it
[18:15] <kristjan> i hope i know how to use it
[18:15] <kristjan> now i got it right
[18:15] <Basil1x> OK... just make sure everything is the same in all 3 files before you append them
[18:16] <kristjan> Ok i changed bitrate but how to i save it now
[18:17] <Basil1x> press start
[18:18] <Basil1x> OH... did you make mkvs or mp4s?  mkvs are more easily appended.
[18:18] <kristjan> mkv
[18:18] <Basil1x> good
[18:21] <nafg_> KDE regularly falls back to xrender. When it does, translucency turns into transparency. Any solution?
[18:26] <Basil1x> nafg_: that's a question for other minds than me... I can handle muxing questions, and that's about all. :)  someone else here will hafta help you.
[18:27] <Basil1x> kristjan: how's the recoding going?
[18:27] <kristjan> ou sorry  :) i got so into this
[18:28] <kristjan> belive it or not its all done
[18:28] <kristjan> thank you
[18:28] <Basil1x> ooh!  it worked?
[18:28] <kristjan> yes

[18:41] <Basil1x> TTFN o//
[19:13] <Basil1x> OK... sound's gone again
[19:13] <Basil1x> I fear this is a real hardware problem
[19:17] <Basil1x> alsamixer detects the card, says everything should be working, but still no sound
[19:18] <Basil1x> should I take this thing in to MicroCenter, or are there still things to try?
[19:20] <BluesKaj> is this a laptop , Basil1x ?
[19:20] <Basil1x> it is
[19:21] <Basil1x> I'd have already had it apart and inspected the innards, else.
[19:21] <BluesKaj> then maybe your power /sleep settings are shutting the audio power down , somehow
[19:24] <Basil1x> I have it set to never, ever, ever, sleep at all, no matter what, period. :)
[19:27] <nafg_> How can I install linux on a machine without a cd or usb?
[19:28] <Basil1x> what *does* it have, nafg_?
[19:28] <Graf_Westerholt> nafg_, you can install it from network.
[19:28] <nafg_> Graf_Westerholt: how?
[19:28] <nafg_> netwrok boot?
[19:29] <nafg_> It has windows now
[19:29] <Graf_Westerholt> I do not know, never did. But I guess the Internet knows. ;)
[19:29] <nafg_> Any way to download it and begin the install from within windows?
[19:29] <Graf_Westerholt> nafg_, yes, you can do it.
[19:29] <nafg_> How?
[19:30] <Graf_Westerholt> But nevere did that either.
[19:30] <BluesKaj> wubi or a VM
[19:30] <Graf_Westerholt> Right, wubi is it :D
[19:30] <nafg_> Doesn't wubi install inside windows?
[19:30] <TheLordOfTime> BluesKaj, don't you need to be able to run the ISO first?
[19:30] <nafg_> I want to make to replace windows
[19:30] <BluesKaj> nafg_, yes
[19:30] <Basil1x> OK... time to inter dad.  BBL
[19:31] <TheLordOfTime> for wubi.
[19:31] <BluesKaj> install wubi then , point wubi to the iso IIRC
[19:34] <TheLordOfTime> BluesKaj, their goal is to remove windows, can they do that without USB or CD/DVD?
[19:36] <yofel> well, you could boot an ISO using PXE and tftp probably, but I've never tried that
[19:37] <BluesKaj> TheLordOfTime, I have no idea how one woiuld do that
[19:37] <TheLordOfTime> yofel, that's assuming the system supports PXE boot
[19:37] <TheLordOfTime> BluesKaj, nor I
[19:38] <genii-around> I've done it
[19:38] <yofel> well, yeah
[19:38] <BluesKaj> hey genii-around , LTNS ...ok how is it done ?
[19:38] <yofel> but you need to get the image from *somewhere*
[19:39] <genii-around> This site explains fairly well how to do it: https://wiki.koeln.ccc.de/index.php/Ubuntu_PXE_Install    it's what i used as a guideline previously
=== TheLordOfTime is now known as LordOfTime
=== LordOfTime is now known as TheLordOfTime
[19:43] <BluesKaj> genii-around, what media would he use to do this ...he wants to wipe windows but has no cdrom or usb
[19:44] <nafg_> This seems to be what I need: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
[19:44] <nafg_> Frugal install
[19:46] <genii-around> BluesKaj: You d/l the iso image to another box, loop-mount it there and configure the pxeboot to use that. The box with PXE but no usb/cd is hooked by crossover or switch to this machine which does the dhcp/tftp booting sequence for it. You can even use a livecd on this other machine if it has Windows or some other OS you don't want to wipe
[19:48] <genii-around> If it's an extremely ancient machine with floppy and no PXE you can get it to do PXE with Rom-O-Matic floppy
[19:48] <BluesKaj> maybe the frugal method will work too
[19:49] <BluesKaj> or buy a usb stick or cdrom fpr 20 bucks :)
[19:53] <jeroen-> yeah I'm having kubuntu
[19:53] <jeroen-> great!!!

[20:02] <jeroen-> haha
[20:02] <jeroen-> yeah, better to delete the taskbar enrty
[20:02] <BluesKaj> seems like redundancy to me'
[20:03] <BluesKaj> I use the virtual desktops with their own widgets which means you can have differnt apps open on differnt frdktops
[20:03] <BluesKaj> err desktops
[20:04] <jeroen-> actually I stopped using virtual desktops years ago
[20:04] <jeroen-> I just keep everything clean
[20:04] <Wizard> I removed "three dot" icon. I use one desktop and icon only task manager. The best ;D
[20:04] <jeroen-> two, three task max
[20:05] <BluesKaj> I reinstalled windows on a spare hdd and I really miss that
[20:05] <jeroen-> what I always miss on windows is the middle click copy/paste function

[20:09] <jeroen-> question about Style > Graphical effects: what does KDE think is a high/low resolution and a high/low CPU?
[20:11] <BluesKaj> jeroen-, that's also a mystery to me , no matter how I set that , there doesn't seem to be anu effect

[20:51] <CoJaBo> As client or server?
[20:52] <ksiads> Client
[20:53] <CoJaBo> In Kubuntu, you just need to go to "Network" in the file manager
[20:54] <ksiads> OK, that's it.  I'm getting rid of my Ubuntu install and replacing it with Kubuntu.  K seems more Windows-friendly.
[20:55] <ksiads> I know they're sort of the same, but Kubuntu seems like it comes pre-installed for Windows users.  Is this correct?
[20:56] <mmo> Kubuntu is Ubuntu with a Windows friendly interface (KDE thats where the K in Kubuntu comes from)
[20:58] <mmo> If you're new to Linux, try the LTS (Long Term Support) versions. F.i. Kubuntu 12.04
