[16:57] <InHisName> wassamatter, bacon not the cure-all its all cracked up to be ?
[17:30] <Samuraialba> nope :(
[17:53] <waltman> LIES
[18:19] <ChinnoDog> Bacon doesn't cause tooth decay
[18:20] <ChinnoDog> If you were on an all bacon diet you would not have tooth decay
[18:23] <ChinnoDog> Decay is caused by fermentation of carbohydrates into acid in your mouth which then eat away at your teeth. Bacon = no carbs = good teeth.
[19:53] <InHisName> and what about all that acid in coke, pepsi, OJ, pineapples, etc. eating away at the teeth too? Anyone bathe their teeth with a liter of coke a day?
[20:04] <ChinnoDog> That is carbonic acid and doesn't harm teeth
[20:05] <InHisName> Only when removed and dumped into science fair experiments, not in your mouth ?
[20:06] <ChinnoDog> Teeth dissolving in soda is an urban legend
[20:06] <ChinnoDog> The sugar in the soda will provide the carbs for the bacteria to make lactic and acetic acid to eat away at your teeth but the carbonic acid is harmless
[20:08] <ChinnoDog> So to summarize, drink diet soda if you are going to go on an all bacon diet to save teeth
[20:09] <InHisName> So, its the carbs and bacteria that completely eat up a tooth over night in the sci fair experiments ?  No acid involved ?
[20:10] <ChinnoDog> Have you ever personally seen a tooth dissolved by soda?
[20:10] <ChinnoDog> (over night or any other time span?)
[20:10] <InHisName> Of course it REALLY hard to sit around for 12 hours with a full mouth of coke and not swollow it.
[20:12] <ChinnoDog> Put a tooth in a glass of soda overnight and nothing will happen

[20:21] <InHisName> When I returned to the Coke fly the next day, I discovered, to my surprise, the fly floating around, unscathed. The Roto-Rooter fly, on the other hand, was dissolved down to a couple of tiny fly bits. The Roto-Rooter had also eaten through the bottom of the plastic cup.
[20:21] <InHisName> Let's all go for Roto-Rooter !
[20:24] <InHisName> Snopes is TOUGH to copy from , need to go to Page-Source to copy text.
[20:40] <ChinnoDog> Luckily I do not know of any soft drinks fortified with roto rooter.
[20:44] <Samuraialba> Uzo
[20:44] <Samuraialba> Wait.. that's booze
[20:45] <ChinnoDog> Orange gatorade has brominated vegetable oil in it. Be more worried about that.
