[12:09] <dpm> hey dholbach! Welcome back!
[12:09] <dholbach> thanks dpm :)
[12:10] <dpm> dholbach, I hope you've got lots of pictures for the Friday demo day ;)
[12:10] <dholbach> haha, yes
[12:10] <dpm> nice
[12:10] <dholbach> uploaded some of them already :)
[12:11] <dholbach> dpm, just listening to your latest end-of-the-world mix
[12:11] <dholbach> good stuff! :)
[12:11] <dpm> ah, cool, glad you like it :)
[12:11] <dpm> I'm djing again this Friday
[12:11] <dholbach> and I'll DJ on Saturday :)
[12:11] <dholbach> can't wait
[12:11] <dpm> excellent :)
[12:14] <dholbach> man, the state of my inbox is depressing
[12:18] <smartboyhw> dholbach, how depressing????
[12:19] <dholbach> sufficiently, but not too much :)
[12:23] <smartboyhw> I have a web speed that is depressing (due to downloading Android source code)
[12:23] <smartboyhw> Estimated finishing time: 18 minutes
[12:23] <smartboyhw> Grrrr
[12:23] <smartboyhw> dholbach, I got 4603 emails piled up in the past three weeks. I only cleared it yesterday evening
[12:37] <dholbach> wow
[12:39] <czajkowski> like me and bug mail over xmas
[12:39] <czajkowski> as automatically subscriped to lp bugs and branch reviews
[12:42] <smartboyhw> dholbach, see?:P
[12:42] <smartboyhw> Quite strange from a 14-year-old
[12:42] <smartboyhw> True though:(
[14:10] <cprofitt> bkerensa: cnet?
[14:37] <JoseeAntonioR> hey, dholbach! (wb, btw) filled that slot?
[14:37] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, no, still there
[14:37] <dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek/Timetable
[14:38] <JoseeAntonioR> maybe someone who can quickly explain what's the development process for phone apps?
[14:39] <dholbach> yeah, although that'd fit a bit better into UADW probably
[14:39] <JoseeAntonioR> right
[14:40] <JoseeAntonioR> maybe something about how translations and launchpad work?
[14:42] <JoseeAntonioR> or something related to all launchpad tools
[14:43] <SergioMeneses> dholbach, is here! \o
[14:43] <dholbach> hey SergioMeneses :)
[14:43] <JoseeAntonioR> we were all missing him
[14:43] <JoseeAntonioR> HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DHOLBACH!
[14:44]  * dholbach hugs you all :)
[14:44] <dholbach> thanks JoseeAntonioR :)
[14:44]  * JoseeAntonioR hugs back
[14:44]  * SergioMeneses brings cake!
[14:48] <JoseeAntonioR> idea! quick tutorial with topic 'you can fix bitesize too!'
[15:22] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, yes, that'd be great
[15:22] <JoseeAntonioR> now we need to find someone who can do it
[15:36] <jcastro> whoa
[15:36] <jcastro> dholbach is back!!!
[15:36] <dholbach> hey jcastro :)
[15:59] <dholbach> jcastro, regarding the mail from Will about the Juju store - is there anything for me left to do?
[15:59] <dholbach> (I don't know anything about it, but was CCed in.)
[15:59] <jcastro> not afaict
[15:59] <dholbach> ok cool
[15:59] <jcastro> Kapil and him discussed everything
[16:00] <mhall119> dholbach is back \o/
[16:00]  * dholbach hugs mhall119
[16:00] <dholbach> are we having a team call?
[16:00] <mhall119> have a good trip?
[16:01]  * mhall119 is on the phone with the ped's atm, but I'm up for a hangout
[16:01] <jcastro> me too
[16:01] <dholbach> mhall119, it was great :)
[16:01] <jcastro> I want to virtually hug dholbach
[16:01] <dholbach> starting the hangout
[16:02] <balloons> hehe
[16:02]  * balloons hugs dholbach 
[16:02] <dholbach> hey balloons
[16:03] <balloons> I was holdng my excitement of your return in.. ;-)
[16:03] <dholbach> hope you're not going to explode :)
[16:13] <balloons> I exploded..
[16:13] <balloons> the hangout bug is still here :-(
[16:15] <dholbach> balloons, did you see didrocks post?
[16:15] <dholbach> http://blog.didrocks.fr/post/Getting-sound-working-during-a-hangout-in-raring
[16:17]  * balloons goes to look
[16:57] <balloons> dholbach, a little bird tells me it's your birthday?
[16:59] <dholbach> balloons, your bird looks well-informed :)
[17:02] <balloons> dholbach, a most wonderful birthday to you!
[17:09] <dholbach> thanks a lot balloons!
[17:22] <jussi> hey dholbach! Happy birthday!
[17:25] <dholbach> thanks jussi
[17:29] <dholbach> all right my friends - I call it a day - see you all tomorrow!
[17:29] <dholbach> daker, شكرا :)
[17:30] <daker> :)
[20:46] <Mez> Hi all, any update on when the Global Jam for Raring will be?
[20:47] <pleia2> I proposed Feb 22-24 for a nice time QA-wise, but I don't know if they ever decided on anything
[20:48] <Mez> being harassed at work "when's the next one?" seems they liked it.  (and need to book out conference centre)
[22:08] <balloons> mhall119, jcastro, is there a way to sign a package with a team as a maintainer, or do I have to be the maintainer?
[22:09] <balloons> I trust that makes sense.. I can't builddeb without being able to sign with a valid gpg key.. but of course I don't have a key for a "team"
[22:09] <cjohnston> balloons: just put that the maintainer is the team
[22:09] <cjohnston> your the uploader in this situation
[22:09] <cjohnston> afaik
[22:10] <balloons> Now signing changes and any dsc files...
[22:10] <balloons>  signfile ubuntu-autopilot-tests_0.10ubuntu1-1.dsc Ubuntu Quality Team <ubuntu-quality@lists.ubuntu.com>
[22:10] <balloons> gpg: skipped "Ubuntu Quality Team <ubuntu-quality@lists.ubuntu.com>": secret key not available
[22:10] <balloons> gpg: /tmp/debsign.hpINwOam/ubuntu-autopilot-tests_0.10ubuntu1-1.dsc: clearsign failed: secret key not available
[22:10] <balloons> debsign: gpg error occurred!  Aborting....
[22:10] <balloons> debuild: fatal error at line 1278:
[22:10] <balloons> running debsign failed
[22:10] <paultag> balloons: use -k
[22:10] <mhall119> -k with your personal key id
[22:11] <balloons> paultag, I'm building with bzr bd, I don't see a -k
[22:11] <paultag> balloons: use -uc -us # and use debsign by hand
[22:11] <mhall119> I *think* you can do "bzr bd -- -k $keyid"
[22:11] <paultag> or that
[22:11]  * balloons rattles head
[22:11] <mhall119> or set an env variable with your key id
[22:11] <balloons> ok, that makes sense..
[22:11] <balloons> heh
[22:11] <balloons> let me try
[22:11] <mhall119> paultag: what's the env, do you know off the top of your head?
[22:12] <paultag> mhall119: DEBSIGN_MAINT
[22:12] <paultag> or DEBSIGN_KEYID
[22:12] <mhall119> DEBSIGN_KEYID, that's the one I use
[22:12] <mhall119> mhall@mhall-thinkpad:~$ cat ~/.devscripts
[22:12] <mhall119> DEBSIGN_KEYID=8981F572
[22:12] <mhall119> balloons: ^^
[22:13] <mhall119> I'm pretty sure bzr bd will use what's in ~/.devscripts
[22:13] <paultag> (or bashrc ;) )
[22:13] <balloons> hmm.. yea, my stuff is in bashrc now
[22:13] <mhall119> or there, but then you only get it if you're running bash
[22:13] <paultag> aye
[22:13] <balloons> why would I run anything else :-p
[22:13] <mhall119> maybe you wouldn't be running it from a shell :P
[22:14] <paultag> wait, this is community-team, why am I in here
[22:14] <paultag> oh god autojoin
[22:14] <paultag> hey guys
[22:15] <mhall119> ah hah ahah
[22:15] <mhall119> you can't escape us paultag
[22:15] <paultag> :)
[22:16] <balloons> lol
[22:16] <balloons> I appreciate the help
[22:16] <paultag> np brotato
[22:16] <balloons> ok, I cheated for a min and built without signing
[22:17] <paultag> (if you're a dude, otherwise something else there)
[22:17] <balloons> yes, I am male :-)
[22:18] <paultag> then brotato stands
[22:18]  * balloons increments the 'mistaken for a female on irc' counter
[22:18] <paultag> no, it's a neutral name and I didn't want to make that mistake.
[22:18] <balloons> lol
[22:18] <balloons> sidebar story: I worked with some folks for like 6 months on another community oss project
[22:19] <balloons> we finally all met in person at a conference, and they were shocked to learn I was male
[22:19] <balloons> apparently between my name and speech, I was clearly female?
[22:19] <balloons> sidebar off
[22:19] <paultag> haha
[22:20] <balloons> context for the joke.. anyways, it happens.. best to not assume etheir way :-)
[22:20]  * mhall119 is shocked to learn that balloons is male
[22:20]  * balloons falls off chair
[22:20]  * mhall119 is even more shocked to see somebody actually say "brotato"
[22:21] <paultag> (clearly not serious)
[22:21] <mhall119> then again, it took me years to realize that jcastro was actually a robot
[22:22] <paultag> .oO(brobot)
[22:23] <balloons> totally..
[22:52] <balloons> mhall119, paultag .. ok, had some other issues to work out, but I can't get -k to work
[22:53] <mhall119> balloons: use DEBSIGN_KEYID instead of -k
[22:53] <balloons> i place it in bashrc and source it
[22:54] <balloons> with the -k, I get:
[22:54] <balloons> debsign: Must be run from top of source dir or a .changes file given as arg
[22:55] <balloons> I could send the it the .changes, if I knew how
[22:55] <mhall119> balloons: what are you trying to sign and for what reason?
[22:56] <balloons> a new package for a new ppa
[22:56] <mhall119> so you need a signed source package to dput?
[22:57] <balloons> yes
[22:57] <balloons> I made an unsigned deb.. looks good in lintlian
[22:58] <balloons> installs ok
[22:58] <Mez> balloons: debsign -kyourkeyid *.changes
[22:58] <balloons> now I want to test it in pbuilder and dput it up :-)
[22:59] <Mez> But the changelog entry should really have your name/email - rather than the teams :)
[23:00] <balloons> yay, it worked
[23:00] <balloons> mez, yes, that was really the source of the question
[23:00] <balloons> I wanted the team to stay as maintainer
[23:00] <balloons> I could overwrite the changelog as myself
[23:00] <Mez> control specifies who the maintainer is :)  It's not particularly important as it gets overriden in ubuntu anyway :)
[23:01] <Mez> (though that may only be for non-ubuntu-specific packages)
[23:01] <Mez> the changelog will get parsed for who to send notifications regarding ACCEPT or REJECTs though aswell as some other things.
[23:02] <Mez> The only other consideration is if it's a debian package rather than an ubuntu one - where it has to have a specific version numbering (upstream-debian.point) and mention it's an NMU
[23:02] <Mez> or have you listed in the control under uploaders/maintainer
[23:03] <balloons> at this point it's just attempting to get into the ppa
[23:04] <balloons> but yes, this will stay a ubuntu only package once it hits the wild
[23:04] <balloons> it has ubuntu tests in it.. perhaps debian would be interested, but ?
[23:05] <mhall119> balloons: can you just re-run "bzr bd -S"?
[23:06] <balloons> yay! it's uploading..
[23:06] <mhall119> \o/
[23:06] <balloons> ok, now to somehow figure out how this happened again
[23:07] <balloons> and why it differed from last time ;-(
[23:07] <mhall119> tail ~/.bash_history
[23:07] <balloons> thanks to all
[23:07] <Mez> balloons: personally, if it's not available in debian - then I'll upload it to debian - always good to have a canonical - espescially if you can build it so it works for both, and maintain it in one place :)
[23:07] <balloons> Mez, nothing preventing it.. I'll keep that in mind when we go to push it in
[23:07] <Mez> balloons: what is it ?
[23:08] <balloons> right now it harldy belongs in a ppa ;-0
[23:08] <balloons> haha
[23:08] <balloons> automated tests
[23:08] <Mez> for ?
[23:08] <balloons> using autopilot specifically
[23:08] <balloons> for the default desktop applicatons
[23:09] <Mez> hmm... drop me an email (mez AT debian.org or mez AT ubuntu.com) when you're done - will have a look and see whether it's something I'm willing to sponsor for debian
[23:09] <balloons> thanks mez!
[23:09] <mhall119> Mez: while you're at it, how about uploading all of Unity ;)
[23:09] <balloons> is autopilot itself in debian? if not, it certainly could be.. it's a seperate package from unity mnow
[23:09] <Mez> np - though - my stuff mainly centres around server based stuff - so might not be the best idea
[23:10] <balloons> but these would require it ofc
[23:10] <Mez> mhall119: Make it work with an nvidia quadro and 3 screens and I'll consider it :P
[23:10] <Mez> currently stuck on lucid at work due to unity :(
[23:10] <mhall119> :(
[23:10] <mhall119> buy Intel
[23:11] <Mez> mhall119: do they make a sensible solution for 3/4 screens on a single PC?
[23:11] <Mez> (all HDMI)
[23:12] <mhall119> three fourths of a screen?
[23:12] <Mez> 3 or 4
[23:12] <mhall119> oh
[23:12] <mhall119> I saw them working on usability on multiple screens, but don't have any myself to try it on
[23:13] <mhall119> is your issue usability, or hardware support?
[23:13] <Mez> both
[23:13] <balloons> I had good usablity with precise on multi monitor
[23:13] <mhall119> usability should be there (I hope)
[23:13] <Mez> usability is ... ok
[23:13] <balloons> I've since gone to one big one :-)
[23:13] <Mez> (but that's personal preference)
[23:13] <mhall119> nVidia support, well, ask Linus how that goes :)
[23:13] <Mez> balloons: I have 3 26" monitors on my workstation
[23:13] <balloons> nice!
[23:13] <Mez> mhall119: lucid works with the 3... precise doesn't
[23:14] <Mez> balloons: switching to 4 soon.
[23:14] <balloons> hehe
[23:14] <balloons> I like the simplitcity of only one now
[23:14] <mhall119> Mez: you know there's this cool thing call workspaces
[23:14] <balloons> but we'll see
[23:15] <Mez> mhall119: yes - which I use :)
[23:15] <mhall119> just checking ;)
[23:16] <Mez> Screen 1: Browsers. Screen 2: Code/Image manipulation, Screen 3: Consoles/Systems Overview/Feeds/Other stuff
[23:17] <Mez> Screen 3 is getting cluttered.
[23:17] <Mez> I need to see all these things at a movement of the eye as part of my day by day job
[23:17] <Mez> Home - I can deal with 2.
[23:17] <mhall119> ctrl-alt-(left|right), saves me the eye and neck movement
[23:18] <Mez> ah, but - that means I can't be alerted by the big thing flashing red on screen 3.
[23:18] <mhall119> then again, I have one 12.5" screen too, and that's enough for me
[23:18] <Mez> it means I can't compare the HTML to what's on the page
[23:18] <Mez> It means I can't see when someone pings me on IRC :P
[23:18]  * mhall119 does that all the time
[23:19] <mhall119> that's what indicators and launcher are for
[23:19] <mhall119> and notifyosd
[23:20] <Mez> notifyosd is ok - but doesn't let me, for example, see a graph spiking (I have to write some elaborate code to see that something is spinking and notify me)
[23:20] <Mez> it's all about the fingerspitzgefuhlen :)
[23:20] <cjohnston> 40
[23:21] <Mez> http://goo.gl/wkr8Q <-- my current workstation during a break on a seperate viewport than the ones I usually use (hence a blank screen 3)
