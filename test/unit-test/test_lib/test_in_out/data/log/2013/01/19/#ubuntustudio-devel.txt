[14:16] <smartboyhw> Good evening gyys
[14:16] <smartboyhw> zequence, new raring kernel is on:P
[14:19] <zequence> smartboyhw: I'm not following :). You installed a new kernel, or you mean there's a new update coming up?
[14:20] <smartboyhw> zequence, new update:P
[14:20] <smartboyhw> I thought you was supposed to update the -lowlatency kernel to a new version
[14:21] <zequence> smartboyhw: We don't update the release version right now. Also, I'm not seeing any bug about it. Which are you referring to?
[14:22] <smartboyhw> zequence, ah:P  referred kernel= 3.8.0-1
[14:23] <zequence> smartboyhw: I mean, which bug report are you referring to
[14:23] <smartboyhw> zequence, you mean a -lowlatency kernel or the new -generic kernel bug?
[14:23] <zequence> We only deal with bugs for lowlatency
[14:24] <smartboyhw> zequence, the strange thing is that they don't create one..... They just created it for -ppc and -ti-omap, which made me went ????
[14:26] <zequence> smartboyhw: Well, it's nothing to worry about anyway. 
[14:38] <smartboyhw> No we are still NOT getting precise live builds:( (cjwatson is fixing it now I think)
[14:38] <smartboyhw> I mean for x86
[14:40] <smartboyhw> zequence, people are asking me if we wanna use 3.2 or 3.5 kernel in 12.04.2...
[14:41] <zequence> smartboyhw: What people?
[14:41] <zequence> Asking who?
[14:41] <zequence> Where?
[14:41] <smartboyhw> zequence, look at #ubuntu-release (or are you there)
[14:41] <smartboyhw> ?
[14:42] <smartboyhw> Asker: cjwatson Answerer: smartboyhw Location: #ubuntu-release
[14:59] <smartboyhw> 12.04.2 x86 live images are BACK!
[15:07] <zequence> nice
[15:12] <zequence> smartboyhw: So, how did your exams go?
[15:12] <smartboyhw> zequence, quite good
[15:12] <smartboyhw> With improvement :P
[15:12] <zequence> That's nice
[15:12] <smartboyhw> Nicer than I thought!
[15:13] <zequence> Are you applying for high school next year? I'm guessing you are that age now
[15:13] <zequence> smartboyhw: What will be your major?
[15:13] <smartboyhw> zequence, Well we don't have to apply for high school. secondary schools run from Form 1 to Form 6 (12-17)
[15:14] <smartboyhw> zequence, we have four compulsory subjects
[15:14] <smartboyhw> Chinese, English, Maths and Liberal Studies
[15:14] <smartboyhw> 2-4 Electives
[15:14] <smartboyhw> For electives I will probably choose Physics, Chemistry and ICT (though ICT might be replaced by biology)
[15:15] <zequence> No programming?
[15:15] <smartboyhw> zequence, what do you think about http://www.2buntu.com/1286/is-ubuntu-phone-targetting-4k-uhd-video-capturing/ ?
[15:16] <smartboyhw> zequence, programming is included in ICT
[15:16] <smartboyhw> Well the Computer Literacy exam was **** this term
[15:16] <smartboyhw> Almost everybody failed...
[15:16] <zequence> heh
[15:17] <zequence> And about the Ubuntu phone, I'll be happy if it is a well working phone once it comes out. I'll probably get myself one
[15:17] <smartboyhw> zequence, yep...
[15:17] <smartboyhw> zequence, I want to load it onto my phone (Remark: It is a cheap Samsung Galaxy Pocket(
[15:17] <zequence> I'm not too concerned with the resolution in the camera. Seems quite adequate already
[15:18] <smartboyhw> zequence, come on my phone has a 2MP camera (Remember: It's an Android 2.3.6)
[19:36] <len-1304> zequence, Have you ever played with netjack?
[20:43] <zequence> len-1304: nope
[20:50] <zequence> len-1304: I'm getting a bit more organized with testing. Installing all releases, both 32 and 64 bit on different partitions in one machine.
[20:50] <zequence> LTS, latest stable, and development release. So, 6 installs all and all
[20:51] <len-1304> Wow, thats a lot.
[20:51] <len-1304> Are you doing reinstalls all the time or just updates
[20:52]  * len-1304 asked about netjack over on LAU
[20:52] <zequence> I'll only be using those 6 for testing, so for the released versions, I'll only be updating. The development release I guess I'll reinstall now and then
[20:53] <zequence> I also be keeping a user/development install of Ubuntu, where I do all the development work
[20:54] <zequence> Thinking the last stable is the best for doing that
[20:55] <zequence> So, 7 installs including that.
[20:56] <zequence> Time for another install..
[22:30] <zequence> len-dt: I didn't realize -generic was installed when installing from the 32 bit isos
[22:30] <zequence> Both 12.04 and 12.10
[22:31] <zequence> amd64 12.04 only installed -lowlatency
[22:31] <len-dt> Thats new.
[22:31] <len-dt> Thtas because there is no PAE any more
[22:31] <zequence> To clarify, both -generic and -lowlatency were installed from the 32 bit ISOs
[22:31] <len-dt> Thats still new
[22:31] <len-dt> They didn't at release.
[22:32] <zequence> 12.04 has pae, both for -generic, as well as -lowlatency
[22:33] <len-dt> That would be correct then... except only one kernel should be there
[22:33] <zequence> Well, worth looking up. I still need to install three more ISOs
[22:33] <zequence> bbl
[23:30] <zequence> len-dt: Also raring
[23:30] <len-dt> Huh.
[23:31] <len-dt> Found my problem with netjack BTW
[23:31] <zequence> Both generic and lowlatency when installing the 32bit ISO
[23:31] <zequence> Haven't read the mail for a while, so I missed what the problem was
[23:31] <len-dt> I was using jackd 1.9.8 in one machine and 1.9.9.4 on the other
[23:32] <len-dt> Works fine with 1.9.9.5 on both (kxstudio version for precise)
[23:49] <zequence> 64bit install of raring failed. md5sum was correct. Retrying making a usb.
