[16:40] <krava> could anyone help me?
[16:50] <Baribal> krava, just ask your question directly, only then people here will see if they can help you.
[16:56] <krava> sorry, I've just not hit Enter...
[16:57] <krava> for this time I've installed MAAS on other hardware, it's working
[16:57] <krava> and ok, I have one node, it is in 'commisioning' state. on console I see login query
[16:58] <krava> hmm... I can't login to node. What's next? Juju?
