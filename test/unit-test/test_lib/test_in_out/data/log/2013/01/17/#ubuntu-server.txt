[14:16] <jamespage> freeflyi1g, ah! I know what that is
[14:17] <jamespage> freeflyi1g, that probably means you have the stock openvswitch module which ships with the kernel loaded
[14:17] <freeflyi1g> jamespage: lemme check

[17:47] <axisys> how can I tell if it is a LUN or physical disk?
[17:47] <axisys> lspci shows
[17:47] <axisys> 07:00.0 RAID bus controller: Adaptec AAC-RAID (rev 09)
[17:47] <axisys> mdstat show
[17:47] <axisys> md0 : active raid1 sdb1[1] sda1[0]
[17:48] <axisys> how can I tell if sda is either JBOD disk or a LUN provisioned by the raid controller?
[17:49] <RoyK> axisys: use a tool for the RAID controller - it's usually exposed as a SCSI device, and linux normally can't see what's underneath
[17:49] <RoyK> most RAID controllers have tools for linux showing the underlying structure
[17:52] <axisys> I wonder if this is a pass through one.. would be easier to replace with bigger size disk then
[17:53] <RoyK> axisys: what controller?
[17:53] <axisys> 12:47:39 < axisys> 07:00.0 RAID bus controller: Adaptec AAC-RAID (rev 09)
[17:54] <RoyK> axisys: http://hwraid.le-vert.net/wiki/Adaptec
[17:54] <axisys> RoyK: thanks
[17:54] <RoyK> iirc that raid controller is a 'true' raid controller, so if configured with RAID, it should show up as a single device in linux
[17:55] <RoyK> but then, you can always configure it in JBOD mode, dunno
[17:55] <axisys> I usually only create single disk raid0 luns
[17:55] <axisys> easier to manage at OS that way
[17:56] <RoyK> yeah, I prefer software RAID over hw raid too
[17:56] <RoyK> configuring each disk as raid0 is normally the same as JBOD
[17:57] <axisys> RoyK: yep.. I would prefer rip the controller out and talk to the disk directly if I could.. lol
[17:57] <RoyK> axisys: perhaps better if you have SSDs, since most (or all?) RAID controllers don't support TRIM/UNMAP
[17:57] <koolhead17> hi all
[17:58] <axisys> they have 300G SSDs relatively cheap?

[18:02] <axisys> RoyK: my bad
[18:07] <axisys> http://pastebin.com/c0figCNK
[18:08] <RoyK> looks like JBOD to me
[18:09] <axisys> please explain (learning)
[18:09] <RoyK> I guess you'll have to reconfigure new devices in the controller's BIOS if replacing drives, though, but that may be different with other BIOSes than the ones I've tried
[18:09] <axisys> I am thrown off by logical device with raid level simple_volume
[18:09] <RoyK> JBOD == just a bunch of disks
[18:10] <RoyK> aka no RAID config on the RAID controller
[18:10] <axisys> i thought each disk is configurd as raid0 lun
[18:10] <axisys> no?
[18:10] <RoyK> yes, which means no redunancy on the controller
[18:11] <axisys> RoyK: correct..
[18:11] <axisys> i do the raid1 using the software raid
[18:11] <RoyK> yes, so did also mdstat show
[18:12] <axisys> so if I want to replace with larger disk.. I will have to take it offline in md first and then offline in the raid controller while system is live..
[18:12] <axisys> correct?
[18:13] <RoyK> in your raid-1, yes
[18:13] <RoyK> do you plan something raid-[56] for the other drives?
=== negronjl` is now known as negronjl
[18:13] <axisys> no .. i only use raid1 and raid10 in OS
[18:14] <axisys> disks are cheap
[18:15] <RoyK> just thinking if you were using raid-5 or raid-6 (which may be slower, but in the case if raid-6, safer), it would be easier to use a disk as a spare, so you could replace that and mdadm --replace to that before removing a device
[18:17] <axisys> gotcha..
[18:18] <RoyK> raid-10 will allow for a single drive failure per mirror, raid-6 will allow for any two drives failing without data loss
[18:19] <RoyK> so unless you're placing a high-traffic database or something like that needing high iops, better use raid-6 (IMO)
[18:24] <axisys> so if I want to replace it bigger size disk I need to take the system down?
[18:24] <RoyK> that depends on the controller firmware
[18:24] <axisys> I was hoping arcconf can offline it and allow to put a new disks and online it back
[18:25] <RoyK> last I worked with that controller, it needed the new device to be defined in its BIOS

[18:26] <RoyK> no idea
[18:26] <RoyK> better try it
[18:26] <axisys> i am looking for how to offline a disk
[18:26] <RoyK> axisys: if you have another drive that will fit in there, just try it
[18:27] <RoyK> axisys: I guess this system isn't in production yet?
[18:27] <axisys> RoyK: it is in production
[18:27] <axisys>  DELETE                  | deletes one or more logical devices
[18:27] <axisys> that might do it
[18:27] <axisys> once i remove it from md raid1
[18:28] <RoyK> just make sure to run a scrub before you remove a disk
[18:28] <RoyK> something like echo check > /sys/block/md0/md/sync_action
[18:29] <axisys> I thought this should be enough
[18:29] <axisys> mdadm /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sdb1 --remove /dev/sdb1
[18:30] <RoyK> that works well
[18:30] <RoyK> but then, if there are errors on the other side of the mirror, you're in trouble
[18:30] <RoyK> so better run a check first
[18:32] <RoyK> what is the application for this server?
[18:35] <adam_g> jamespage: zul http://people.canonical.com/~agandelman/g2_deps/ are these okay to upload to grizzly-staging CA pocket? they'll get rid of all/most the red in staging @ http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/cloud-archive/grizzly_versions.html
[18:36] <zul> damn it i havent looked at it
[18:36] <zul> gimme a couple of minutes
[18:37] <zul> shouldnt ceph be precise-grizzly?
[18:37] <zul> adam_g: ^^^
[18:37] <RoyK> axisys: ?
[18:38] <zul> adam_g: alembic looks ok
[18:39] <zul> adam_g: why is leveldb needed?
[18:39] <adam_g> zul: actually, yeah, exclude the ceph stuff
[18:40] <zul> adam_g: k
[18:45] <zul> adam_g: they look good although you will need a newer testrepository (ubuntu6 runs the testsuite during the build)
[18:45] <zul> and we already talked about ceph
[18:46] <axisys> RoyK: oops.. sorry went to pick up something for lunch..
[18:46] <zul> adam_g: i think we might need the openvswitch snapshot from raring in there as well
[18:46] <axisys> RoyK: it is for splunk
[18:46] <RoyK> so I guess no big needs for high iops :P
[18:47] <axisys> RoyK: yep
[18:49] <RoyK> then my suggestion is, get a couple of 1-2TB drives and create a raid-5 on those, copy the data over to them (or perhaps you have another server somewhere), and start from scratch with two drives in raid-5, add more drives as needed, extend to raid-6 if you're paranoid
[18:49] <axisys> looks like only disks (raid0 luns) under raid10 will be replaced with bigger disk
[18:49] <axisys> RoyK: ^
[18:49] <RoyK> you can do all that dynamically
[18:49] <RoyK> (mdadm raid, I mean)
[18:49] <SpamapS> smoser: hey, are you aware of any bugs in cloud-init's handling of the legacy 'user:' cloud-config option?
[18:49] <stemid> anyone had success with user --groups staff in kickstarting ubuntu Precise? whenever I add --groups staff to the user line in my kickstart file the install stops at the user creation bit, as if the whole line is made invalid by this.
[18:49] <SpamapS> smoser: having some trouble with it in 12.10 images
[18:50] <RoyK> axisys: I'm quite sure that's not right - I think replacing drives with bigger ones in a raid-[56] should work well
[18:50] <smoser> SpamapS, it would not surprise me if there were a bug, but i thought we'd got it working right.
[18:50] <smoser> SpamapS, example ?
[18:51] <axisys> raid10 gives best performance
[18:51] <RoyK> axisys: yes, it does, but do you need that performance?
[18:51] <axisys> I guess I will trun off splunk and then run check and offline and fail on each disk.. at a time
[18:51] <RoyK> axisys: if you don't, better spend time on safety
[18:52] <RoyK> axisys: install sysstat and enable it and you'll see over time what the i/o load is
[18:52] <RoyK> probably very low
[18:52] <SpamapS> smoser: trying to use heat w/ stock 12.10 images
[18:52] <SpamapS> smoser: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1542277/
[18:53] <SpamapS> smoser: ec2-user is created, but never gets ssh keys
[18:53] <axisys> we have all splunk servers on raid10.. wont have enough time to redo all
[18:54] <SpamapS> smoser: root does actually end up getting the specific ssh key though
[18:54] <jamespage> adam_g, yes - leveldb, ceph (in that order - otherwise it won't pickup the new version)
[18:54] <jamespage> thats the bobtail release
[18:54] <jamespage> and python-hp3parclient as well
[18:54] <jamespage> for cinder
[18:57] <adam_g> jamespage: okay, adding hp3parclient. what are we doing with ceph? 0.56.1 into precise-grizzly?
[18:58] <SpamapS> smoser: also in root's authorized_keys file, the user is not 'ec2-user', it is 'NONE'
[18:59] <RoyK> axisys: well, raid-10 should do as well, but I don't know it too well in terms of replacing drives
[18:59] <SpamapS> smoser: hrm, you know what? This was with 0.7.0-ubuntu2 ... let me try again w/ the latest cloud image.

[19:11] <smoser> SpamapS, it is a bug.
[19:11] <RoyK> axisys: try at off hours first, after a scrub, to remove a drive and reinsert another, perhaps the raid tool can do a rescan and recreate a raid-0 on that drive, after that you should be able to mdadm --add that drive
[19:15] <jamespage> adam_g, yes please re ceph
[19:15] <jamespage> but please make sure the leveldb package is updated first; there are some improvements worth having :-)

[19:16] <adam_g> jamespage: ok

[19:21] <smoser> you can just declare it in the new form

[19:21] <smoser> so just declare both.
[19:21] <smoser> i think

[19:51] <smoser> SpamapS, just fyi, apparently (through documentation i just read) you can snpecify ssh authorized keys for each user.
[19:51] <smoser> and even per-user ssh-import-ids
[19:51] <smoser> but it still "should work" what you want
[19:51] <SpamapS> smoser: in this case I just want the instance keypair for the user. :)
[19:52] <smoser> anyone else having issues with ec2 today?
[19:52] <smoser> euca-describe-instances is blocking
[19:52] <SpamapS> smoser: still no ssh keys for ec2-user with 'default: true'
[19:59] <SpamapS> smoser: I am thinking this might be something else in the stack causing issues
[19:59] <SpamapS> smoser: booting a quantal instance with just that userdata produces a key just fine
[20:00] <SpamapS> smoser: as in, just 'user: ec2-user'
[20:01]  * SpamapS decides to consider it over lunch
[20:03] <smoser> well, SpamapS please open abug if its not working right.
[20:03] <smoser> but i thought i had reproduced

[20:25] <jkyle> I have a file that's been modified after installation. when dpkg prompts for how you want to handle it
[20:25] <jkyle> how can I force apt to accept the maintainer's version? I tried -y & --force-yes

[20:46] <adam_g> jamespage: thoughts on retargetting the nova live migration charm work under review as merges into the respective branches of ~openstack-charmers, to condense the # of in-flight changesets?
=== Ursinha is now known as Ursinha-afk
[20:58] <jamespage> adam_g, sounds like a good idea - I've been having trouble keeping track
[21:01] <adam_g> jamespage: yah, same here. ill see about resolving conflicts and proposing some merges to the ~openstack-charmers branches for nova-compute, nova-c-c, keystone, glance. also gonna stick a rabbitmq-server charm with hacluster support and propose changes to the amqp hooks of the other charms

[22:03] <hallyn> say (looking at an untriaged bug) is tomcat7 explicitly not meant to run with oracle java?
[23:02] <TLoT> is it possible to restrict only certain SSH logins to have key-auth only?
[23:02] <TLoT> thereby prevent password auth for a user?
[23:03] <sarnold> most admins prefer disabling password auth for everyone
[23:04] <TLoT> true, however i can't do that globally because of one user.
[23:04] <TLoT> who is already on ther eceiving end of hell for using insecure passcodes
[23:08] <adam_g> roaksoax: ping
[23:09] <sarnold> TLoT: the only thing I can think of -- and it's a bit ugly, but I'm saying it in the hopes that someone else will have a good idea :) -- is to run a second sshd, with a different set of PAM modules (pam_succeed_if?), on a different port for your special user.
[23:09] <TLoT> eww that does sound ugly :p
[23:09] <TLoT> i'd rather just kick the one user who needs password-only auth to /dev/null :P
=== ariel__ is now known as Guest88403
[23:12] <Guest88403> anybody here?
[23:12] <sarnold> TLoT: oh! pam_succeed_if could probably do it just for the one user
[23:13] <sarnold> TLoT: .. without a second daemon.
[23:14] <TLoT> sarnold, still ugly
[23:14] <TLoT> Guest88403, sup
[23:15] <sarnold> TLoT: sure, but much less ugly.
[23:16] <Guest88403> can you show me how to put my ip on the map
[23:24] <roaksoax> adam_g: pong
[23:26] <irv> how do i make a directory writable by my user
[23:27] <adam_g> roaksoax: are you doing work on DRBD /w the hacluster stuff?
[23:27] <roaksoax>  adam_g yes
[23:28] <adam_g> roaksoax: where at? and hows it going? thinking maybe need that for this rabbit stuff
[23:28] <roaksoax> adam_g: most of the stuff is here: https://code.launchpad.net/~andreserl/charms/quantal/mysql/hacluster-support
[23:28] <roaksoax> all of the stuff for now
[23:29] <roaksoax> so it is up to mysql to set its own DRBD stuff and then passes resources,constraints, etc to hacluster to be configured
[23:36] <adam_g> roaksoax: hmm. wondering if theres anyway to make the drbd stuff more consumable from other charms.
[23:39] <roaksoax> adam_g: we can have some of it in an external lib or something. I wanted to make it in the hacluster charm at first but in reality it didn't fit there
