[00:33] <mhall119> jono: starting to see some first designs on balsamiq: https://ubuntu.mybalsamiq.com/projects/ubuntuphonecoreapps/grid
[00:34] <jono> mhall119, yeah, I saw that :-)
[00:35] <mhall119> gods the wiki is slow though, subscribing should not be a multi-minute process
[00:36] <mhall119> I like the "contants" tab on this calculator mockup: https://ubuntu.mybalsamiq.com/projects/ubuntuphonecoreapps/CoreApp+Calculator+Retrieve+from+Memory
[00:36] <mhall119> I've not seen that on anything before, but it sounds convenient
[00:38] <jono> mhall119, I pinged IS about that earlier
[00:38] <jono> but when I pinged them it sped up
[00:38] <jono> lol
[00:40] <mhall119> they probably have an IRC bot that restarts services whenever "wiki" is mentioned in their channel
[00:40] <mhall119> or if they don't, they should
[00:41] <cjohnston> sounds like jcastro needs to get a dele initiative going again
[00:41] <cjohnston> delete
[00:41] <jcastro> did someone say delete?
[00:42] <cjohnston> hehe
[00:42] <cjohnston> jcastro: rm -rf *?
[00:45] <jono> there is not enough coffee in the world
[00:45] <jono> what a week!
[00:45] <cjohnston> there is for that command
[00:45] <cjohnston> oh
[00:46] <jono> mhall119, lol
[02:19] <jcastro> man, whose idea was it to use balsamiq for this
[02:19] <jcastro> buy them a beer!
[02:28] <mhall119> jcastro: dpm's
[04:41] <jono> would someone mind redditing my Q+A from today - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=synlnIErJKU&feature=plcp ?
[04:41] <jono> just so people can be up to date with the questions and answers
[07:17] <dholbach> good morning
[07:20] <JoseeAntonioR> hey, dholbach!
[07:20] <dholbach> hola JoseeAntonioR
[07:21] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: how's it going?
[07:21] <dholbach> good good - how about you? how's life over there?
[07:21] <JoseeAntonioR> pretty fine, we just got canonical hosting for onair
[07:21] <dholbach> yes, I saw the mail
[07:21] <dholbach> good work!
[07:22] <JoseeAntonioR> can  you please login so I can get the account right?
[07:22] <dholbach> when I try to log in, I get to Not Found
[07:22] <dholbach> Apologies, but we were unable to find what you were looking for. Perhaps searching will help.
[07:22] <dholbach> and it says "Howdy, login.ubuntu.com/+.....
[07:23] <dholbach> let me retry
[07:23] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: try with onair.ubuntu.com/login
[07:23] <dholbach> aha
[07:23] <dholbach> same thing
[07:24] <JoseeAntonioR> oh, wait, but you're in
[07:24] <JoseeAntonioR> that's a known issue :)
[07:24] <dholbach> I can edit my profile
[07:24] <JoseeAntonioR> looks like you didn't provide the info (username, email, name, etc)
[07:25] <JoseeAntonioR> that's why it uses your openid as username
[07:25] <dholbach> For security reasons, your profile URL must be one of your claimed OpenIDs:
[07:25] <dholbach>     https://login.ubuntu.com/+id/....
[07:26] <dholbach> I'm not sure where I can put that into a text box anywhere
[07:27] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: when you login into the page it says it's requesting some info, were the boxes unchecked?
[07:27] <dholbach> yes
[07:27] <dholbach> I checked them
[07:27] <dholbach> or actually I tried both
[07:28] <JoseeAntonioR> if you checked them after logging in for the first time, won't work
[07:28] <dholbach> ok, let me try again
[07:28] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: one sec
[07:29] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: try now
[07:30] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, great
[07:30] <dholbach> the dashboard still looks a bit empty
[07:31] <JoseeAntonioR> blargh, it's showing your username as your openid
[07:31] <JoseeAntonioR> I just set you as admin
[07:32] <dholbach> yes, and it can't be changed
[07:32] <dholbach> but I just added a nickname and set it as "publicly display as"
[07:32] <dholbach> not sure if that helps
[07:32] <JoseeAntonioR> wanna try again? I can delete the account for you to login again, if you one
[07:32] <JoseeAntonioR> s/one/want
[07:33] <dholbach> as long as I can log in and do stuff that's fine with me :)
[07:34] <JoseeAntonioR> ok, you can do that :)
[07:34] <dholbach> cool
[07:34] <dholbach> thanks a lot for taking care of it
[07:34] <JoseeAntonioR> no worries
[07:35] <JoseeAntonioR> btw, do you know how to remove that search bar?
[07:35] <dholbach> no, no idea
[07:36] <JoseeAntonioR> np then
[07:36] <JoseeAntonioR> so everything should be set up for your devel hangout, if you run into any troubles just ping me
[07:37] <dholbach> thanks a bunch Jos√©!
[07:38] <JoseeAntonioR> :)
[09:27] <dholbach> brb
[14:37] <jcastro> <-- bbi 20min
[14:44] <popey> miss you already!
[14:44] <popey> probably would have had more impact if I'd said that 6 minutes ago
[14:57] <mhall119> well it does take a little while
[15:11] <dpm> man, I was saying this earlier already, but the mockups for the phone apps look awesome. The ones for the RSS Feed Reader have been created by an actual UX designer who said he happens to use Balsamiq for the daily job -> https://ubuntu.mybalsamiq.com/projects/ubuntuphonecoreapps/grid
[15:12] <dholbach> smartboyhw, I had a chat with balloons yesterday and we'll sort it out
[15:14] <popey> those balsamiq designs are great, and less than 24 hours after the call to action!
[15:16] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, do you mind if we use other colours on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek/Timetable? the orange will clash with links in there when we link to logs later :)
[15:16] <dholbach> that's the reason I went for light and dark grey
[15:16] <dpm> popey, indeed!
[15:17] <dholbach> ... which indeed is not very colourful
[15:18] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, and I added "(Hangout!)" to the sessions which are hangouts - if you also want to make that more colourful or stand out more, just do it :)
[15:27] <smartboyhw> dholbach, thx
[15:53] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, do we still have to fill out the classroom calendar thing?
[17:22] <jcastro> czajkowski: hey you still doing MAAS things?
[17:23] <czajkowski> jcastro: I think so
[17:23] <czajkowski> mailed the questions to the guys this week
[17:23] <jcastro> oh
[17:23] <jcastro> yeah I was just wondering about the missing wiki page
[17:23] <jcastro> http://askubuntu.com/questions/245096/adding-nodes-to-maas
[17:23] <jcastro> just as proof to people that sometimes I do care about missing wiki pages. :p
[17:23] <czajkowski> hm  let me ask nick
[17:24] <czajkowski> but I didnt think the Avahi stuff was ever up there
[17:24] <czajkowski> 2 ticks
[17:26] <czajkowski> jcastro: he says it's server team page, smoser may know more
[17:26] <jcastro> k
[18:06] <dholbach> all right my friends - I call it a day - see you all tomorrow!

[19:22] <jono> mhall119, around?
[19:31] <mhall119> jono: yes
[19:32] <jono> mhall119, I have a quick Django question
[19:32] <mhall119> sure
[19:32] <jono> mhall119, is there a way to customize the drop down menus in Django's admin panel
[19:33] <mhall119> yes, but...
[19:33] <jono> as an example, if I have a field for 'Category' and a drop down menu item is "foo", can I programmatically append something before "foo":
[19:33] <jono> oh?
[19:33] <mhall119> you end of creating custom Admin classes that override the defaults
[19:34] <jono> mhall119, I thought that was just for laying out the admin interface?
[19:34] <jono> so essentially I want to just customize the text in the combo box but still return the same value
[19:34] <mhall119> oh, then it migh tbe easier
[19:35] <jono> oh?
[19:35] <mhall119> is the drop-down list from a foreign key, or a choices=[] list?
[19:35] <jono> mhall119, foreign key
[19:35] <jono> and I essentially want to put prepend another database entry in the combo
[19:36] <mhall119> so instead of "foo" you want it to say "something foo"?
[19:36] <mhall119> or you want "something" to be an option above "foo"?
[19:38] <jono> mhall119, quick G+?
[19:38] <mhall119> sure
[20:54] <jono> balloons, quick G+?
[20:54] <balloons> sure, just a sec
[20:54] <balloons> finishing a blog post
[20:55] <balloons> well nvm... I'll hold it :-)
[20:55] <jono> cool
[20:55] <jono> balloons, invite sent
[21:07] <daker> hi
[21:17] <jcastro> man so I guess the css on planet for overflowing images isn't fixed
[21:17]  * jcastro clobbers planet with impunity
[21:19] <bkerensa> jcastro: looks like debian carries the same bug :) http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=613598
[21:19] <ubot2> Debian bug 613598 in www.debian.org "planet.debian.org: large images can overflow into the sidebar, obscuring its content" [Normal,Open]
[21:20] <jcastro> ours is a bit different, the sidebar remains on top
[21:34] <daker> jcastro: no one cares https://code.launchpad.net/~daker/ubuntu-website/light-planet-theme2-fixes/+merge/45245
[21:36] <jcastro> !
[21:36] <jcastro> ok who can I poke about this
[21:36] <daker> i don't know
[21:36] <daker> jcastro: rhlee ?
[21:38] <jcastro> hah
[21:38] <jcastro> how do you approach someone like that
[21:38] <jcastro> "Hey dude, no pressure, it's only been 2 years, but mind checking out this merge proposal?"
[21:38] <daker> hahaha
[21:42] <popey> !
[21:44] <daker> !
[21:48] <daker> bkerensa: same bug
[21:49] <jcastro> popey: I like this new transforming window when you place them thing in unity
[21:49] <jcastro> the new special effect
[21:49] <jcastro> though it looks like you guys squared off the icons on the launcher
[21:49] <popey> it doesnt work for me
[21:49]  * jcastro prefers the old tv lens look
[21:50] <popey> same ubuntu corner as the phone ui
[21:52] <mhall119> jcastro: we're the last generation that'll recognize that as a TV screen
[21:53] <jcastro> mhall119: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-s8NtxG5baS0/TtOc-85lE3I/AAAAAAAAESY/-IMhm077mnE/s1600/cassette-tape-and-pencil-li.jpg
[21:54] <mhall119> jcastro: exactly :)
[21:55] <bkerensa> daker: I know who to poke :) and they will be poked
[21:58] <mhall119> daker: I think you still have a year to go before you beat the Forum's waiting record
[21:58] <daker> Ubuntu World Record!
[22:05] <bkerensa> Why is the forum still waiting?
[22:05] <bkerensa> I thought the fix was ready?
[22:06] <jcastro> waiting on the templates
[22:07] <bkerensa> ah
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
[22:45] <jcastro> s-fox: do you have a screenshot of the progress to share with bkerensa?
[22:46] <jcastro> last I looked they're making good progress, before it was like orange on orange and unreadable
