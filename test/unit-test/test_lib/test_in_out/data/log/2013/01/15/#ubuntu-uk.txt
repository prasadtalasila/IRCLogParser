[00:18] <bootkigftrgds> Just watching the action Linux Show 'bout Übuntu Phone. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=33GiecW1E-4#!
[00:18] <bootkigftrgds> sorry Linux Action Show I meant.

[00:22] <Azelphur> Operation ikea galant megadesk complete https://www.dropbox.com/s/1pjwb9qwf4wfnz3/2013-01-15%2000.12.29.jpg
[00:22] <Azelphur> one coffee table was harmed during the making (it was cannibalised for parts, it will be missed.)
[00:26] <daftykins> Azelphur: good work ^_^
[00:26] <daftykins> those diagonal legs would cause me to be screaming in pain before too long i sense
[00:27] <Azelphur> nah, they don't come out from under the table
[00:28] <daftykins> ah
[00:28] <daftykins> your place's tubes come yet?
[00:28] <Azelphur> tubes?
[00:28] <Azelphur> oh internet, no
[00:28] <Azelphur> not till feb :(
[00:29] <daftykins> ah ye =[
[00:34] <Seeker`> Azelphur, thats a lot of desk space
[00:34] <Azelphur> indeed
[00:34] <Seeker`> Azelphur, just how much space do you need to blow up arduinos?
[00:34] <Azelphur> Seeker`: lots, haha
[00:35] <daftykins> where else do you stack the dead parts? bins are too small
[00:37] <Azelphur> shh :p
[00:37] <Azelphur> I don't kill most of my things :(
[00:38] <Azelphur> https://www.dropbox.com/s/c6d1t5pbugxfc67/2013-01-15%2000.36.38.jpg is my hack involving coffee table legs
[00:39] <Azelphur> that panel is supposed to have legs on the right where that place is
[00:39] <Azelphur> but instead I used coffee table legs to attach it to the desk right next to it, that does have legs
[00:39] <Azelphur> xD
[00:39] <Azelphur> hopefully it won't fail.
[00:40] <daftykins> Azelphur: sorry i didn't even know about this, i just joined in :<
[00:40] <Azelphur> daftykins: hehe, yea I have a rep for breaking everything, although I usually break software ;)
[00:40] <daftykins> :D
[00:41] <daftykins> i got shipped an internal matrix orbital LCD display once, that had the serial cable wired wrong
[00:41] <daftykins> it caught fire in the bottom of my case 8D
[00:41] <Azelphur> meep o.O
[00:41] <daftykins> i email'd and said, hai guys, um, it kinda burnt?
[00:43] <Seeker> daftykins: a long long time ago, every time Azelphur plugged an arduino in to his computer, it stopped working
[00:43] <daftykins> XD
[00:43] <Azelphur> yea lol
[00:43] <daftykins> so, last year? :>
[00:43] <Azelphur> I never did get it to work
[00:43] <Seeker> completely killed it
[00:44] <Azelphur> I don't think it's actually dead
[00:44] <Azelphur> I think it just hates my PC.
[00:44] <Azelphur> I had them ship me a replacement out, and they said the one they got back worked fine, and the new one I got didn't work in exactly the same manner
[00:44] <Azelphur> so, I call software issues xD
[00:44] <Azelphur> either that or my PC asplodes arduinos.
[00:45] <daftykins> :D
[00:46] <daftykins> hate it when that happens
[00:46] <daftykins> you need a second less-attacked PC for such times ;)
[00:46] <daftykins> at least now you have a victim next door to demand things of :D
[00:49] <directhex> 7 new games saw the first stages of being added to steam for linux today
[00:49] <popey> yay
[00:49] <popey> which ones?
[00:50] <Azelphur> daftykins: hehe
[00:51] <Azelphur> oO, new games
[00:51] <directhex> not sure, i haven't kept a log of that kind of data. X3 is new. so is Lume. and Shank 2.
[00:53] <directhex> some other odds & sods added recently. spacechem dlc; various dedicated server apps
[00:53] <daftykins> the army grows
[00:54] <bootkigftrgds> I got Empathy to load up on my Lubuntu netbook, but when I ask it to load 'an account' it just ges to system setting .. what am I doing wrong ?

[02:31] <bootkigftrgds> Quick question : When's the next ubuntu uk podcast ?? (this month ??)
[02:34] <popey> bootkigftrgds: dunno actually
[02:34] <popey> we take a break over xmas and usually start in feb
[02:35] <popey> we tend to go out for a curry to decide what we're going to do the same/differently
[02:35] <bootkigftrgds> damn. you doing the graveyard again ?
[02:35] <popey> graveyard?
[02:36] <bootkigftrgds> Well my point would be to add a answering machine to the skype phone for the channel (free) and also flatter so I can fund it/you.
[02:36] <bootkigftrgds> **flattr
[02:36] <bootkigftrgds> meant graveyard-shift.
[02:37] <popey> no, I'm in California
[02:38] <bootkigftrgds> Wow, I'm sure I can hear highway 1 in the background !!
[02:39]  * bootkigftrgds wonders if popey has seen any lost boys ?
[02:40] <bootkigftrgds> right this is serious ,::: We will definitely need a pic of you in Bermuda shorts :)

[02:42] <popey> finally Azelphur ☺
[02:42] <Azelphur> indeed :D
[02:42] <Azelphur> I kinda had to cannibalise a coffee table to make it work.
[02:42] <Azelphur> but, it works \o/
[02:43] <bootkigftrgds> popey, did you bring the inflatable beach ball too ??
[02:44] <bootkigftrgds> Azelphur: What graphics card are you using ??
[02:44] <Azelphur> bootkigftrgds: GTX 570 + GT 630
[02:44] <bootkigftrgds> so the screens just work outta the box ??
[02:45] <Azelphur> no.
[02:45] <Azelphur> if your going multi screen get an ATI card
[02:45] <bootkigftrgds> Azelphur .. what tweaks did you do ?
[02:46] <Azelphur> bootkigftrgds: nvidia deliberately brick multi monitor support on Linux, the only way it works is with separate X screens, which is buggy, and generally crap.
[02:46] <Azelphur> get ATI cards, it works much better I hear.
[02:46] <Azelphur> I'm planning on switching at some point.
[02:47] <bootkigftrgds> you just need my carpet office mat from Viking, that's all.
[02:47] <bootkigftrgds> or do you stay in one place ??
[02:47] <Azelphur> carpet office mat? :p
[02:47] <Azelphur> I stay in one place pretty much
[02:48] <bootkigftrgds> mmm.. I have 4 computers running 7 screens in my lounge... so I need to scoot about on the floor etc ..
[02:49] <Azelphur> fun
[02:49] <popey> i didnt bring my silly shorts with me
[02:49] <bootkigftrgds> buy some !!
[02:50] <bootkigftrgds> Azelphur:  do you think we can crowdfund popey some silly shorts ??
[02:50] <Azelphur> haha, maybe
[02:50] <Azelphur> I have to head off now though, gotta be up early tomorrow
[02:50] <bootkigftrgds> np
[02:50]  * Azelphur waves
[02:51] <bootkigftrgds> o/
[02:52] <bootkigftrgds> popey, I remember California radio being quite bad, have you got used to it yet ??
[02:52] <popey> not listened to it
[02:52]  * popey goes for beer
[02:52] <bootkigftrgds> Have you met Mickey ?
[03:04] <popey> I thought he lived in Florida
[03:10] <bootkigftrgds> No he travels to California too .. he lives at Universal Studios.. :)
[03:14] <bootkigftrgds> & if you see Arnie, tell him I want a refund on his Terminator film as I can't hack a ATM with an Amstrad NC200 like it shows !! :D
[09:12] <Azelphur> whats the general opinion on how long I should leave a freezer standing after being transported? It's a reasonably new freezer (I think it came out sometime in 2011), LEC u5526w (manufacturer conveniently has no way to get the manual)
[09:12] <diplo> Thought it was like 2 hours from memory
[09:12] <knightwise> 24 hours
[09:12] <diplo> Could be wrong, I always used to leave it over night though
[09:12] <knightwise> to make sure.
[09:12] <Azelphur> ^ welcome to the responses I find online haha
[09:12] <knightwise> diplo: same her
[09:12] <knightwise> e
[09:12] <Azelphur> 2...no 24...no 48!
[09:13] <Azelphur> I got it in at like 2pm yesterday and I got food arriving at 3pm today to go in it, so pondering when I should turn it on
[09:13] <Azelphur> or if I should abort and find an alternative storage location for said food :P
[09:13] <diplo> now or in the next couple of hours will be fine Azelphur
[09:13] <Azelphur> righto :)
[09:13] <Azelphur> I'll fire it up, inb4 explosions
[09:13] <diplo> never had an issue in 20 years of doing it the above way
[09:14] <daftykins> is this all about letting the gas settle and acclimatise or something?
[09:15] <diplo> yep daftykins, I honestly don't think it's an issue now adays
[09:15] <diplo> I think this was a thing from years ago
[09:16] <daftykins> i bet the manuals say
[09:16] <diplo> It's mainly if it's been on it's side etc
[09:16] <diplo> If it stood upright, I don't believe it's an issue
[09:16] <czajkowski> aloha
[09:17] <Seeker> Azelphur: is there still snow outside?
[09:17] <Azelphur> Seeker: nope
[09:17] <Azelphur> there we go powered it up, no explosions as of yet
[09:17] <daftykins> Azelphur: *slap crash bang wallop*

[09:18] <hoover> morning all

[09:34] <knightwise> just type /nick and then your nick
=== bootkigftrgds is now known as solarcloud
[09:48] <solarcloud> Awesome !!
[09:50] <dwatkins> tada
[09:51] <brobostigon> good morning everyone,
[09:52] <dwatkins> ello ello
[09:52] <daftykins> heya
[09:52] <brobostigon> morning dwatkins and daftykins
[09:53] <daftykins> just email'd the guy that has my email address @gmail.com except with an "8" before the @ to ask if he is related to another person who lives near him and seems to be signing me up to their online purchases also :D
[09:53] <daftykins> brobostigon: hello sir
[09:53] <dwatkins> daftykins: I discovered yesterday that there are tens of people in the US with my name
[09:53] <MartijnVdS> dwatkins: DW Atkins?
[09:54] <dwatkins> MartijnVdS: heh, no - Dominic Watkins
[09:54] <daftykins> dwatkins: :D
[09:54] <dwatkins> one of them is a production designer, see IMDB
[09:54] <daftykins> Dustin kept signing me up (Dave) and now Deborah seems to be at it too
[09:54] <daftykins> they're both in Arizona :>
[09:54] <daftykins> i've got her company on the emails so i can just try and contact someone directly otherwise
[09:55] <MartijnVdS> There's only one person who shares my name
[09:55] <daftykins> be so funny phoning the US and asking for someone by name
[09:56] <directhex> it's not that there are other jo shieldses, i think there's more than one directhex
[09:57] <daftykins> :D
[09:59] <daftykins> if ever there were a conference i would imagine the conversation would be very indirecthex
[09:59] <daftykins> (sorry)
[10:04] <daftykins> ah c'mon it was good :<
[10:04] <directhex> heh
[10:04] <directhex> poor daftykins, not appreciated for his comedy
[10:04] <daftykins> ;)
[10:04] <daftykins> inorite
[10:04] <directhex> y'know, all the best artists only got appreciated after their death
[10:04] <daftykins> www.themu.co.uk
[10:05] <daftykins> glad that guy made that product after all, but £25 is a rip
[10:29] <dwatkins> yeah daftykins - I was hoping for a mains cable for laptops with that on
[10:29] <dwatkins> he seemed to be in talks with Apple, not sure where that went, if anywhere.
[10:30] <daftykins> :O
[10:34] <daftykins> ugh hate when the sun shines directly in on your screens and your contrast ratio drops to nil
[10:34] <daftykins> :>
[10:38] <ubuntubhoy> Morning folks - is it possible to disable the Unity sidebar ?
[10:38] <MartijnVdS> ubuntubhoy: you can make it autohide
[10:38] <ubuntubhoy> yeah
[10:38] <ubuntubhoy> not quite the same
[10:39] <ubuntubhoy> still gives notifications
[10:39] <MartijnVdS> uh?
[10:39] <MartijnVdS> notifications are not in the sidebar
[10:39] <MartijnVdS> they're top-right
[10:40] <ubuntubhoy> the icons jiggle when wanting attention
[10:40] <MartijnVdS> ubuntubhoy: you can disable that
[10:40] <ubuntubhoy> I didn't mean system notifications
[10:40] <ubuntubhoy> aha
[10:40] <ubuntubhoy> how so my good fellow ?
[10:41] <MartijnVdS> probably using ccsm or dconf-editor
[10:41] <ubuntubhoy> will have a little look about
[10:41] <ubuntubhoy> cheers
[10:41] <SuperMatt> I'm actually finding that I'd quite like the dodge behavior back
[10:44] <SuperMatt> I've been playing around with blender in full screen, and it's a little annoying that it doesn't disapper by default
[10:44] <SuperMatt> in fact, it'd be nice if I could chose behavior based on application
[10:47] <gord> i had to approve the merge to remove the dodge behavior (in code) from unity, i got angry emails for that
[10:47] <SuperMatt> yeah? what was the reason for removing it?
[10:47] <SuperMatt> I guess lack of consistancy?
[10:48] <gord> was never sure about that, i think it didn't user test well or something. i liked it
[10:48] <SuperMatt> well, you can't really complain about user testing
[10:49] <SuperMatt> I guess it is a bit of a confusing feature
[10:49] <SuperMatt> especially if a new user is on a laptop
[10:49] <SuperMatt> sure they get more screen space, but they don't know how to open stuff
[10:50] <dwatkins> I noticed my search box pops up whenever I press alt if I have the bar set to auto-hide, perhaps I should upgrade...
[10:50] <MartijnVdS> dwatkins: that's the menu thingy
[10:50] <MartijnVdS> or whatever the official name is
[10:50] <MartijnVdS> I've disabled it.
[10:51] <dwatkins> I'm still not sure about the whole thing, especially as I can't move the bar, but that's another discussion entirely ;)
[10:51] <directhex> i'm deploying gnome fallback, i think, in a corporate environment
[10:52] <directhex> feedback from users is that shell is terrible and unity is terrible
[10:52] <directhex> the real issue is discoverability
[10:52] <dwatkins> directhex: yeah, I got that impression when I used fluxbox recently, and it reminded me how I'd discovered a whole bunch of applications by exploring the menus
[10:53] <gord> i find if you base too many decisions on user testing you just end up with an overly homogeneous design
[10:53] <dwatkins> granted, fluxbox isn't the most modern window manager, but still - I learned a lot by just looking at what's available
[10:53] <dwatkins> agreed, gord
[10:53] <directhex> gord, true. but the counterpoint to that is if you run a business & expect users to do their jobs, they need to be able to use their computers
[10:54] <dwatkins> sadly it reminds me of Windows 8 - many people who use it for the first time have trouble finding fundamental things like the start menu and the shutdown button: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheMissingWindows8InstructionalVideo.aspx
[10:54] <gord> sure, but its not one or the other, i doubt the mouse would of user tested well back in the day
[10:55] <daftykins> i couldn't find shutdown the first time i ran win8 in a VM :(
[10:55] <dwatkins> I may be set in my ways, but I liked the idea of an 'applications' menu in Gnome which you could browse through to find types of apps, like video-related ones etc.
[10:55] <daftykins> though going for the screen edges is totally counter-intuitive with a VM
[10:55] <daftykins> and hard to pull off even
[10:55] <directhex> there's a big difference between testing on users, and asking users what they think
[10:55] <dwatkins> daftykins: indeed, that's the main issue I have with that 'corners' thing
[10:55] <directhex> if you ask users what they think, you'll get bull answers
[10:55] <MartijnVdS> directhex: not always
[10:55] <directhex> if you observe users' behaviour when trying to use it, you get useful data
[10:55] <MartijnVdS> directhex: you need to do both :)
[10:56] <directhex> the answer to "what do you want" is *always* "what i'm used to"
[10:56] <dwatkins> find out what they need?
[10:56] <daftykins> silly change haters
[10:56] <dwatkins> personally I need a way to find out what apps there are for a given task, and a way to get to the control panel items easily
[10:56]  * MartijnVdS has Alt+F2 for both ;)
[10:56] <dwatkins> so the old ways of Gnome suit me well
[10:57] <dwatkins> MartijnVdS: what if you don't know the name of an app, though?
[10:57] <MartijnVdS> dwatkins: apt-cache search
[10:57] <dwatkins> MartijnVdS: yeah, I've used that a lot, but straightaway we're in command line territory, when it should just be a case of looking in a folder
[10:57] <directhex> menus are discoverable
[10:57] <dwatkins> e.g. 'video' or 'audio' etc.
[10:57] <dwatkins> as directhex says
[10:57] <directhex> i know they're the least fashionable thing in computers right now, but they are
[10:57] <dwatkins> and on that note, I'm off to a meeting, have fun :)
[10:58] <directhex> so much as we want to move to a post-menu touchscreen world, menus are the easiest way for a user to look at her options & select the appropriate one
[10:59] <gord> menus are pretty bad at that really, but i don't think there is a good replacement yet that isn't too "out there"
[10:59] <daftykins> dwatkins: i'm watching that guys shorter 4 min video, hilariously the more i learn how windows 8 works the less it makes sense to me XD
=== Guest40495 is now known as mgdm
[11:00] <directhex> _I_ don't know how to see which apps i have that i could run, in unity
[11:00] <daftykins> directhex: i totally agree, if something is presented you can discover and learn how to use it
[11:00] <daftykins> although truth be told i accidentally learnt some gestures on an OS X snow leopard touchpad recently by just trying 3 finger swipe left and right in Safari
[11:00] <directhex> i mean, seriosuly, unity is awful for discoverability
[11:00] <daftykins> i had a feeling since two scrolled, more might do that - and i was right!
[11:01] <directhex> it's great if you already know what you want, much like with shell and win8
[11:01] <directhex> i.e. just type
[11:01] <directhex> but that's not a step forwards. especially in touchscreenland
[11:01] <daftykins> yeah the first time i saw unity i just thought - where the hell did everything go? my first task was to find the desktop resolution settings, i didn't think more stuff would be glued on the menu that comes down beneath the power button :S that was odd
[11:01] <directhex> also, i freaking HATE the modern multi-window paradigms. i've slowed down so much since i stopped having one taskbar button per window
[11:01] <gord> i recently needed to export a pdf from safari in ios to a pdf reader. it took me about ten minutes to figure it out. turns out you have to tap, once the pdf is open in safari, but on the content not any of the safari gubbins. then you get a send to menu
[11:02] <directhex> if i have ten terminals open, with useful titles on them, unity multiplies the number of clicks i need
[11:03] <daftykins> first thing i disable in windows 7, those silly 'tiles' on the taskbar instead of text-adorned items
[11:03] <daftykins> no grouping permitted, no combining
[11:03] <directhex> the global menu is one of apple's stupidest design decisions since it forces the user to manually track which window has focus (therefore which window the global bar applies to). totally counterintuitive
[11:03] <daftykins> gord: haha nice
[11:04] <daftykins> directhex: yeah took me a while to get used to that. plus then shortcuts aren't available system wide, e.g. command+shift+u opens the utilities folder but only IF the finder is the currently active process
[11:04] <directhex> all of unity's messing about is fine from an experimental perspective, but lucid was a more usable business desktop than precise, purely due to all the ubuntu design team's stuff. and using shell on precise would be no better, since shell has its own set of user-hostile paradigm shifts
[11:07] <directhex> i'm not saying ubuntu sucks any more than i'm saying upstream gnome sucks, when it comes to blithely changing established computer usage patterns for the very well justified reason of LOOK BEHIND YOU A THREE-HEADED MONKEY
[11:07] <directhex> unity is far far more usable than shell, IMHO
[11:07] <directhex> but that's like picking your favourite STD
[11:07] <daftykins> i can't even try gnome3 in a VM 'cause it falls to fallback saying i have no hardware support, despite 3D accel being enabled O_O
[11:07] <mungbean> tried elementary?
[11:08] <daftykins> my dear watson?
[11:08] <mungbean> quickest and nicest DE around IMO
[11:09] <directhex> mungbean, how do i install it on precise?
[11:11] <daftykins> directhex: do you ever have a fiddle with debian still?
[11:11] <mungbean> directhex: best to boot from liveusb at the mo
[11:12] <mungbean> as its still beta
[11:12] <mungbean> i tried adding the repo to 12.04 but some other DE/theme settings interfered - might be OK on relatively clean install though
[11:13] <directhex> mungbean, then it's not something i care about
[11:13] <directhex> daftykins, i use debian as my "place to upload things". i don't upload to ubuntu directly
[11:13] <mungbean> try it out anyway
[11:18] <SuperMatt> ooh, fedora 18 today
[11:18] <neuro> it's finally old enough to drink
[11:20] <daftykins> directhex: not sure i follow
[11:20] <daftykins> neuro: perhaps in giving it a spin, that shall show
[11:21] <directhex> daftykins, i use and deploy ubuntu, on desktops. i'm a debian developer & contribute to debian
[11:22] <daftykins> oh ok
[11:22] <daftykins> upload in that sense

[11:52] <solarcloud> When I try to Add an account in Empathy, It just opens up the System settings .. What am I doing wrong ???

[11:53] <directhex> solarcloud, nothing, in modern gnome. empathy gets its accounts from the Ubuntu Online Accounts pane in system settings
[11:53] <Mez> solarcloud: is there an online accounts option in there ?
[11:53] <solarcloud> daftykins: Fifth element ?
[11:53] <davmor2> morning all
[11:53] <ahayzen> solarcloud, empathy uses the online accounts part of system settings now to manage accounts
[11:53] <daftykins> solarcloud: hrmm which bit?
[11:54] <solarcloud> daftykins: Dunno, just a hunch.
[11:54] <solarcloud> thanks about Empathy .. there's no 'onlne' A/c.s things afaik

[12:04] <beatsonline> basically, it's useless , then.
[12:04] <ali1234> yeah pretty much
[12:04] <ali1234> once again all the other desktops have been thrown under a bus to make something trivial work in unity
[12:05] <beatsonline> how do I get unity working for Lubuntu ??
[12:05] <ali1234> you don't
[12:05] <beatsonline> oh poo.
[12:06] <ali1234> just stop using empathy and install pidgin
[12:07] <beatsonline> but i want to use all the other services .. is there a message aggregator other than empathy ( to use identi.ca etc ) . ??
[12:07] <MartijnVdS> your web browser?
[12:07] <beatsonline> it's too slow .. i want to et message updates etc ..
[12:07] <beatsonline> **get
[12:08] <beatsonline> althou, it is chrome :)
[12:10] <ali1234> if you install gnome-control-center-signon
[12:10] <ali1234> and then modify the .desktop to remove the OnlyShowIn: line
[12:10] <ali1234> and then install gnome control center
[12:10] <beatsonline> I'm doing that ..
[12:10] <ali1234> then you will be able to configure accounts in empathy

[16:18] <shauno> playback is fine on my pi.  (and my 900MHz celeron).  it tends to be the UI that gets sloppy first
[16:18] <DJones> installed the remote control on my phone to control it rather than having to go to a keyboard/mouse

[19:50] <BigRedS> meet: what happens when you try?
[19:50] <meet> BigRedS: shall i give you the output?
[19:50] <meet> the thing is i am not able to apt-get update also.
[19:50] <BigRedS> pastebin it

[19:54] <BigRedS> there doesn't appear to be a quantal version of that ppa
[19:55] <BigRedS> http://ppa.launchpad.net/mefrio-g/plymouthmanager/ubuntu/dists/ is all the releases for which there is a repo
[19:56] <meet> so how to remove that error?
[19:56] <meet> moreover can i install the package despite these errors?
[19:57] <BigRedS> well, if you remove the ppa it'll stop trying to downloa it and stop triggering the error
[19:58] <meet> how to remove the ppa?
[19:58] <BigRedS> it might be that the oneiric one works, but it may well not, I've no idea
[19:58] <popey> sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
[19:58] <BigRedS> you'd need to check with the maintainer, probably. There might be a newer PPA supplying the same thing
[19:58] <meet> i got a blog which said they worked on the 12.10 and 12.04
