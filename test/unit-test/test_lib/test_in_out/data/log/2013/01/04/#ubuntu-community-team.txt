[00:44] <jcastro> Have you ever used a Nexus phone (like Galaxy Nexus or Nexus 4) with ICS? If so, how can you claim the interface is not beautiful and polished?
[00:44] <jcastro> I have, and I can claim the interface is not beautiful and polished.
[00:45] <jcastro> that's the best thing I've heard all day
[00:45] <jono> jcastro, lol :-)
[01:21] <jcastro> jono: ah! look at this one

[01:29] <jono> jcastro, who did that?
[01:33] <jcastro> some guy, it's posted here: http://www.iloveubuntu.net/how-create-currency-converter-app-ubuntu-phones-step-step-official-guide
[01:33] <SergioMeneses> jcastro, ++
[01:33] <SergioMeneses> btw good evening
[02:15] <mhall119> 45 minutes to go through the currency converter tutorial, and that include a break to put the kids to bed
[02:15] <mhall119> not bad at all

[03:00] <hrabbey> Hi; Not sure which channel / path best.
[03:00] <hrabbey> Trying to figure out where / who best to contact for setting up a quick face-to-face chat on 1/9 at CES 2013 in Las Vegas.
[03:01] <hrabbey> Company reason for chat: We are helping IVI (via GENIVI) with Navigation (Mapping, GPS, etc.) core tech.
[03:01] <hrabbey> I am interested in how IVI-Remix and Ubuntu phone could mesh with that work.
[03:02] <hrabbey> To put it a different way: Any plans yet for the project /workgroup to put maps & location support in Ubuntu phone?
[03:05] <hrabbey> I will drop by the booth in any case, but it is nice to avoid that the best person to talk to did not just step away for a break.
[03:27] <bkerensa> hrabbey: There is a formhttp://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone/contact-us
[03:28] <mhall119> hi hrabbey
[03:28] <mhall119> popey: are you around to help hrabbey?
[03:28] <mhall119> or jono ?
[03:29] <mhall119> hrabbey: if you come back around here in, say, 12 hours, there will be more folks around :)
[03:31] <hrabbey> Will do.  So this is an OK channel for the question then?
[03:32] <hrabbey> I always hesitate on forms, cause I feel they are impersonal, and the form kind of hinted they didn't have time to talk to anyone other than phone manufacturers.
[03:32] <hrabbey> If it is a waste of time, I do not want to waste their time.
[03:34] <JoseeAntonioR> hrabbey: this is the right channel to ask, and it's not a waste of time :)
[03:34] <JoseeAntonioR> the people in charge are away, so if you come back you'll probably find them onlie
[03:35] <hrabbey> Thanks.  I'll check back in tomorrow then.
[03:35] <JoseeAntonioR> thanks to you for the interest! :)
[03:35] <hrabbey> I figured it was a bit late, but hoped I could at least get a hint that I was on the right track.
[03:36] <hrabbey> Thanks for all the work in making Ubuntu the great platform it is and will be.
[03:41] <jono> hrabbey, can you email me?
[03:41] <jono> jono@ubuntu.com
[03:41] <hrabbey> Sure.  Will do.
[03:42] <jono> thanks!
[03:43] <hrabbey> My pleasure.  Good night.
[04:05] <marcoceppi> Hey jono, if you're around would you care to weigh in on this: http://meta.askubuntu.com/questions/5682/do-we-need-a-new-ubuntu-for-phones-tag The AU community is in a strong disagreement with the mobile tag being used for the tablet and phone questions on the site. Is there a preferred tag from a Canonical standpoint?
[04:05] <marcoceppi> I just want to make sure the right people track the right tags on your end
[04:06] <jono> marcoceppi, thanks for letting me know
[04:06] <jono> I will weigh in

[09:55] <dpm> gooooood morning everyone!
[10:14] <czajkowski> dpm: is there a place to send web app developers to in particular?
[10:16] <dpm> hi czajkowski, on IRC, if they've got questions specific to Ubuntu web apps, then #ubuntu-webapps. If they've got questions about app development in general (including web development), then #ubuntu-app-devel. For questions on Ask Ubuntu the tag is 'application-development'
[10:16] <dpm> and we probably have a tag for web apps there, let me see if I can find it...
[10:17] <czajkowski> dpm: cool and is there any website ?
[10:18] <dpm> czajkowski, http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/webapps/
=== kloeri_ is now known as kloeri
[10:19] <czajkowski> dpm: perfect thanks
[10:19] <dpm> np. There's also http://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/webapps, but it's more for user questions rather than for dev questions
[10:20] <czajkowski> nods
[10:20] <czajkowski> cheers
[10:54] <AlanBell> dpm: most of that is outdated and doesn't quite work
[10:56] <dpm> AlanBell, what do you refer to by "that"
[10:56] <AlanBell> http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.04/javascript/ for example, I think if you click all the links the calls are wrong
[11:00] <dpm> AlanBell, I don't have a 12.04 system to test. Do you think, or do you know they are wrong? If they are wrong and you could file a bug on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntudeveloperportal/+filebug I can fix those docs myself on the site.
[11:01] <AlanBell> they are wrong in 12.10, they used to wrok
[11:02] <AlanBell> showNotification can't take two parameters, it needs a third for example
[11:04] <AlanBell> http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/webapps/ links to that documentation, however look what I found http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.10/
[11:05] <AlanBell> http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.10/javascript/uwapi-ref.html
[11:05] <AlanBell> that is updated but seemingly not linked to from anywhere
[11:06] <AlanBell> there is a bigger problem that I can't now write a webapp and having specified in the init call that I want version 1.0 of the API I don't know whether that is a 12.04 or 12.10 client with different APIs so why on earth is there a version number in the API call?
[11:08] <AlanBell> bug 1035581
[11:08] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1035581 in WebApps: Applications "Unity Web API Documentation code snippets don't work" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1035581
[11:14] <czajkowski> AlanBell: that bug is assigned to alex
[11:15] <czajkowski> good job it'll be fixed then
[11:17] <AlanBell> the documentation might be fixed (well it has been to an extent, just not put in the navigation)
[11:18] <AlanBell> the problem is that we are making it very hard to develop webapps that work on multiple versions of Ubuntu
[11:23] <AlanBell> actually it looks like the API was changed within 12.04 as well from the bug
[11:52] <dpm> AlanBell, ok, I've updated the page with the 12.10 link now: http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/webapps
[11:53] <dpm> in doing that, I've broken the embedded video, though
[11:55] <AlanBell> excellent!
[11:57] <AlanBell> dpm: does the last one adding launcher items work for you?
[11:57] <AlanBell> Error while dispatching call to Launcher.addAction: TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method '_addAction'
[11:58] <dpm> webapps are unfortunately pretty broken on my system, so I'm probably not the best reference :)
[11:58] <AlanBell> ah OK
[11:58] <dpm> sorry
[11:59] <AlanBell> well at least having most of the calls work is a huge improvement
[12:00] <dpm> AlanBell, alex-abreu on #ubuntu-webapps might be the best person to ask atm. I've got access to the API docs on d.u.c, so if you find out more, just ping me and I can apply the changes straight away
[12:02] <AlanBell> great. And, yes that video has gone :( but with the hello world example working I think more people will stick with it
[12:08] <dpm> yeah, I don't know why wordpress is no longer embedding the video, I've been playing with it for 20 mins, and I even restored the original version, but no joy. I give up :/
[13:50] <jcastro> dpm: wordpress hates you today
[13:51] <jcastro> it gets like that sometimes, mean spirited.
[13:52] <dpm> jcastro, indeed, I think it needs some rest after the hammering in the last 2 days
[13:59] <doctormon> jcastro: The ghost of wordpress present is here to show you the error of your blog! ~wooo~
[14:38] <mhall119> dpm: wasn't it a plugin that embedded the videos?  Maybe IS just needs to re-enable it
[14:40] <dpm> mhall119, good point, but I think it's standard WP functionality, and not handled by a plugin. Oddly enough, the embedding was working before I did my (unrelated) edit to the page. I'm not really sure what's going on.
[14:41] <mhall119> ah, nvm then
[14:41] <jcastro> maybe it's the cache in front of it?
[14:54] <dpm> jcastro, yeah, I was thinking about it as well, but as I have no idea on how caches work, I'm a bit at a loss :(
[16:02] <jono> dpm, jcastro, mhall119, balloons invite sent
[16:03] <dpm> ok!
[16:03] <jcastro> I will be 60 seconds late
[16:04] <jcastro> wrapping up a call
[17:09] <SergioMeneses> morning!
[17:10] <SergioMeneses> balloons, let me know when you will be available
[17:12] <balloons> SergioMeneses, kk
[17:47] <doctormon> jono: Any movement on the design-team email I sent you before UDS?
[17:47] <jono> doctormon, I will check back into it
[17:47] <doctormon> OK, thanks jono
[18:44] <jcastro> jono: lol didn't we have a call today?
[18:52] <jono> jcastro, I figured we talked yesterday
[18:52] <jcastro> works for me
[18:52] <jcastro> I have one thing to bring up by I can PM
[19:16] <jcastro> hey AlanBell
[19:16] <jcastro> there's a bug for being able to granularly turn lenses/scopes' online thinger on and off
[19:16] <jcastro> do you have that handy?
[19:56] <AlanBell> hi jcastro
[19:56] <AlanBell> bug #1087873
[19:56] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1087873 in unity (Ubuntu) "lens privacy feature does not work on all lenses" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1087873
[19:57] <AlanBell> not quite
[20:01] <AlanBell> I sent some emails to the ayatana list about it and did a blog article, not sure there is a bug about more granularity, just lots about "it doesn't work"
[20:22] <AlanBell> bkerensa: you know this is not about the default lenses right?
[20:22] <bkerensa> AlanBell: Ahh I thought it was
[20:23] <bkerensa> AlanBell: then its not really a bug is it since they are third party ppa mostly?
[20:23] <AlanBell> nah, they are all coded up to check the flag
[20:23] <AlanBell> it is a huge bug
[20:23] <jcastro> right, but isn't there a bug for "I should be able to turn some online searches on, and some off."?
[20:24] <AlanBell> I don't believe there is a bug for that because it is working as designed
[20:24] <AlanBell> to the extent that it works
[20:25] <AlanBell> bkerensa: http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2012/12/privacy-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/
[20:27] <AlanBell> I was told to file bugs like Bug #1092279 for things that don't respect the single flag
[20:27] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1092279 in Google Documents Lens "does not respect the privacy flag" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1092279
[20:28] <AlanBell> but there are just too many and I can't be bothered to review them all because I don't agree with the fix it in every lens approach
[20:37] <jcastro> oh, I remember seeing a mockup of what that would like like and assumed there would be a bug
[20:39] <AlanBell> oh that, um one sec
[20:40] <AlanBell> http://people.ubuntu.com/~alanbell/Privacy.png
[20:41] <AlanBell> that was on an email to the design list to spark discussion about the design

[21:13] <jcastro> yeah
[21:17] <jono> snap-l, nice!
[21:17] <jcastro> this guy is kind of creepy at getting the personalities right
[21:17] <jcastro> I like how he kind of overplays it to make a point
[21:17] <jcastro> Like the Van Halen one, lol
[21:20] <snap-l> Van Halen really is about overplaying, though
[21:20] <snap-l> It's somewhere between the balance of the right amount of notes for the measure, and too many notes. ;)
[21:21] <jcastro> yeah

[21:42] <rrnwexec> mhall119: if you want a copy of the unedited i can get it to you though :)
[21:42] <mhall119> it's cheating to do interviews half-way through a party with free beer

[21:43] <rrnwexec> mhall119: will let you in on the pre-release then. your interview was quite awesome.

[21:58] <jcastro> have a good weekend everyone
[21:58] <cjohnston> that's all you had to tell me?

[21:58] <jcastro> snap-l: you get our housewarming invite?
[21:58] <jcastro> cjohnston: yeah, think of it as motivation to work on the django charm
[21:58] <jcastro> hah
[21:58] <cjohnston> i thought there was one
[22:03] <mhall119> jcastro: is there a charm for dovecot?
[22:03] <JoseeAntonioR> mhall119: I think yes
[22:10] <snap-l> jcastro: Yeah, I did
[22:26] <jono> mhall119, around?
[22:41] <jono> cjohnston, ping?
[22:41] <jono> Quick Django question: I have three tables, A, B, and C, each is linked via a Foreign Key C(B), B(A) and I know the pk of A - how do I return all records from C when I just know the pk of A with this relationship?
[22:50] <james_w> jono, C.objects.filter(b__a=pk) might work
[22:50] <james_w> where "b" and "a" are the attribute names of B and A on C and B respectively
[22:53] <james_w> yeah, seems to work fine
[22:54] <jono> james_w, so does b__a specify two keys I can search?
[22:54] <james_w> jono, if C.b is the attribute that refers to B
[22:54] <james_w> then C.objects.filter(b=<id>)
[22:55] <jono> james_w, gotcha
[22:55] <james_w> will find you all Cs that reference the B with <id>
[22:55] <jono> thanks james_w, will give that a try
[22:55] <james_w> double underscore moves another link down the chain
[22:55] <james_w> so b__a=<pk> finds all C where C.b.a.pk == pk
[22:59] <jono> james_w, I get: Cannot resolve keyword 'b' into field
[22:59] <james_w> jono, you need to use the attribute name for B that is used on C
[22:59] <james_w> jono, if you share your model definitions then I can be more precise
[23:00] <jono> james_w, sure, I will pastebin it
[23:01] <jono> james_w, ahhh I got it working
[23:01] <jono> like you say, I specified the attributes
[23:01] <jono> thanks james_w!
[23:02] <james_w> np
