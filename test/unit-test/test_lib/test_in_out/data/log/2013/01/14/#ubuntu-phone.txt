[09:33]  * Tak blink
[09:35] <mesquka> Preliminary ROM's could be expected in late Febuary
[09:37] <dwatkins> ROM's what? ;)
[09:38] <atiti_> how about pre-preliminary roms :D
[09:39] <atiti_> or a very very short "building from sources"
[09:39] <atiti_> or "getting started with porting to your phone"
[09:40] <mesquka> pretty much
[11:59] <elkng> is ubuntu-phohe will contain regular ARM version of linux where one can get any open source software compilled and run and no need to have market as for android phones ?
[12:03] <hourd> no reason why not
[12:38] <damian_^> so ubuntu hinted at the 14th? did anything happen?
[12:39] <Tm_T> 14th?
[12:43] <hourd> of Feb?
[12:43] <damian_^> ahh nevermind, i was reading a forum last night and people were trying to solve some riddle shuttleworth gave, they had it come down to a date, 14th january. but i have just noticed that 14.14 is the version number of ubuntu-phone so im assuming that has something to do with it
[12:44] <hourd> wouldnt it be somethign like 13.04?
[12:45] <damian_^> http://www.extremetech.com/computing/102599-ubuntu-14-04-will-be-a-smartphone-and-tablet-os-so-what
[12:45] <damian_^> i had read that, but noticed its from 2011. im trying to hunt down the forum post and riddle...
[12:47] <damian_^> internets full of rumors and lies anyway
[12:51] <ubuntubhoy> damian_^: they dont expect a release of a handset till early next year
[12:51] <ubuntubhoy> but the first images and source will fall in Feb
[12:52] <damian_^> oh so they will be releasing their own handset or expect other manufacturers to use it next year?
[12:52] <damian_^> and yeah, i own the nexus, patiently waiting :)
[12:52] <hourd> deals with manufacturers
[12:52] <ubuntubhoy> other OEMs
[12:52] <ubuntubhoy> that's why they announced now
[12:53] <ubuntubhoy> to cast their net at CES
[12:53] <ubuntubhoy> and hopefully strike a deal somewhere along the line
[12:53] <hourd> i would think they will get a deal pretty quickly
[12:53] <ubuntubhoy> so I doubt they will call anything a full release until the handset comes to market
[12:54] <ubuntubhoy> hourd: hopefully
[12:54] <damian_^> awesome, it really looks like an ios killer, hope it is recieved well :) android is great and all but being a dev myself i know first hand the troubles with using a virtual machine on low powered hardware..
[12:55] <damian_^> and ios being so closed... nightmares... i gave up developing for it
[12:55] <Walther> Yeah. And one thing particularly important to me: security.
[12:55] <ubuntubhoy> dev'ing should be a lot easier
[12:55] <ubuntubhoy> and you can start now
[12:55] <Walther> I hope the ubuntu phone will have decent security for apps
[12:55] <ubuntubhoy> test on your Ubuntu PC OS
[12:56] <Walther> The android way has its benefits (running each app in a separate sandbox) but the apps tend to ask for ridiculous permissions
[12:57] <ubuntubhoy> to be fair, there have not been many stories of large apps abusing their permisions
[12:58] <damian_^> tbh deving for me is about money, its my job, and my passion dont get me wrong, but it pays well and ive made a living from it and just dont have the time to support ubuntu until it is financially feasable...
[12:58] <damian_^> hehe yeah, live wallpapers requesting to send sms's and make calls,
[12:59] <Walther> ubuntubhoy: but why the hell does e.g. angry birds want permissions to read my phone calls and have network access -> potentially sending my phone logs to Rovio for what reason exactly
[12:59] <damian_^> (and yes i know im not very open source spirited but i dont have hours to spend coding for free...)
[13:00] <damian_^> although given the posix compliances and etc, it seems dead easy to port between ios and ubuntu-phone
[13:01] <Tak> hah
[13:01] <damian_^> lol, i bet i just pissed off a lot of people
[13:03] <ubuntubhoy> Walther: I am not saying it is right, just that of the major apps from trusted backgrounds there has been very little reports of abuse
[13:04] <damian_^> i just installed angry birds, all is asks for is access to internet, and i assume thats for ads and purchases. didnt ask to read call logs or anything
[13:04] <ubuntubhoy> I think it was a general example rather than exact
[13:05] <Tak> there's no such thing as a general example
[13:05] <Tak> it's either an example or it isn't
[13:05] <damian_^> turns out the star wars and seasons versions do want to read my call logs anyway... highly suspicious
[13:06] <ubuntubhoy> Tak: that's just being anal
[13:06] <Tak> no, it's not rationalizing being wrong
[13:10] <Walther> damian_^: yes, it is very weird.
[13:10] <Walther> and those are not the only apps <.<
[13:11] <Walther> otoh, i may have some hope that google some day calls me and hand a job offer, now that they can read not only my search history and email but my notes, calendar, etc as well
[13:11] <Walther> :OP
[13:11] <Walther> :P *
[13:12] <mint_> give here
[13:13] <mint_> hi
[13:13] <ubuntubhoy> Walther: they can only read your info if you use their services
[13:14] <ubuntubhoy> it's the choice you make
[13:14] <Walther> Yes, yes... But well, point me a single mail and/or calendar app that works on par
[13:14] <Walther> Apart from pen and paper, that is :P
