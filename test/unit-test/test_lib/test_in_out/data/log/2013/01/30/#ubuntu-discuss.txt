[15:02] <bluefoxxx> What is the appropriate way to file feature requests?
[15:03] <IdleOne> you file a bug at launchpad.net and in the bug title you put WISH:
[15:03] <bluefoxxx> Next question
[15:03] <IdleOne> rest of your title
[15:03] <bluefoxxx> Are useful administrative tools "feature requests" or out of scope?  Or does it depend on the scope of the tool (i.e. apparently Apport was not out of scope)
[15:04] <bluefoxxx> Specifically I have been want for a Linux analog of http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645 with command line and GUI interfaces for quite some time
[15:05] <bluefoxxx> and no, that is not 'strace' or 'ltrace' (it's more like 'strace and ltrace everything all at once and apply filters')
[15:06] <IdleOne> looks like you want htop with a GUi
[15:10] <bluefoxxx> most of the stuff I work on has no gui but htop sounds good
[15:12] <bluefoxxx> IdleOne, not sure that's relevant
[15:13] <bluefoxxx> I just used process monitor here to deal with Aptana on Windows being stupid (and Windows being stupid in general)
[15:14] <bluefoxxx> There's no visible configuration for ssh, and when Aptana tries to use git it calls sshw.exe, which calls ssh... telling it to filter for 'ssh.exe' and for 'id_dsa' in "path" got me down to 214 events (from 2,870,000)
[15:14] <bluefoxxx> one of which showed me that it was searching a network path for .ssh/id_rsa instead of a local path
[15:14] <bluefoxxx> (filtered for 'id_rsa' rather)
[15:15] <bluefoxxx> that's what I'm looking for:  Admin tools that let you specify that vague things are happening on your system, and please tell me why and what
[15:19] <bluefoxxx> oh well.  At least we have stuff like Puppet and Pulp and mcollective and ldap that can keep up with WSUS and SCCM and ActiveDirectory now.  Getting closer to parity.
