[00:17] <krabador> hi ubuntu-phone devs, i'm not a developer, i only would know if with the source to be released, it would be possible to port ubuntu phone os on other devices than galaxy nexus
[00:18] <k1l> krabador: that should be possible, _but_ keep the hardware specs in mind and be aware that the driver situation is a mess on arm
[00:20] <krabador> yes, i know about no documentation
[00:20] <krabador> of arm soc
[00:22] <bef0rd> as long as you are able to flash other custom ROMs, I think it would be possible to do it
[00:22] <krabador> k1l, i really would use ubuntu-phone on mine, without an app store too
[00:22] <krabador> bef0rd, that's properly what i'm hoping for >(
[00:23] <krabador> :)
[00:25] <krabador> i really hope in a possibility of canonical to support more platoforms possible
[00:29] <Hashcode> I'm not sure canonical even needs to directly support more platforms, if the main build is open sourced similar to AOSP.
[00:29] <Hashcode> I think devs will find a way to make it work :)
[00:29] <krabador> many dual core with 1gb of ram will never have the actual android version, and especially the next. with ubuntu os properly working, without features of future high specs phones too, i think it would be a great popularity boost for canonical, and for next canonical business
[00:31] <Hashcode> I have full Android running on 512MB ram devices which never had an original 3.0 kernel.  It's all possible.
[00:32] <Hashcode> I think Ubuntu will probably run even better on those devices due to the native code etc.
[00:32] <krabador> Hashcode, yes i was mean "officially"
[00:32] <krabador> yes
[00:43] <krabador> i'm really waiting the end of february with impatience, i'm the user type that don't uses all the "core apps" :)

[00:58] <e3mark> Hello everyone good morning
[01:27] <surgemcgee> I can not for the life of me figure out why the Template element works in the show case but not alone in my apps! Ahhhhhh
[01:34] <surgemcgee> Also, encouragement to the Ubuntu team. It feels good to be a IT dev only due to the dedicated teams at Canonical.
[01:35] <surgemcgee> Like it or not ;)

[06:54] <_raven> hi
[06:54] <_raven> how vis the chace to get ubuntu phone for asus  padphone2?
=== XenGi is now known as XenGi_
[07:21] <livefree424_> Anyone excited to wait about a year
[07:36] <_raven> how vis the chace to get ubuntu phone for asus  padphone2?
[09:13] <_raven> anyone here?
[09:40] <popey> _raven: yes
[09:40] <_raven> popey how think you about the chance to get ubuntu phone on the asus padphone 2?
[09:41] <popey> depends if someone is willing to put the work in to make it happen
[09:43] <_raven> i have to make the decision to send it back
[09:43] <_raven> obviously there is not at least a cyanogenmod rom for it
[09:44] <popey> dont bet on us making an image for it
[09:47] <_raven> means less chance?
[09:48] <popey> someone in the community might do it, but there's no guarantee of it
[09:48] <_raven> ok i hope for it
[09:58] <karanluthra> Im a 3rd year comp sc undergrad, looking forward to contribute to the calendar app for ubuntu mobile os. Where to start from? I just read the user requirements.
[10:22] <doomlord> _raven: you could consider offering  bounty
[10:22] <_raven> ?
[10:22] <doomlord> maybe other padphone owners would do the same
[10:23] <doomlord> i think its  big job though
[10:24] <doomlord> Question: What QuadCore phone is most likely to get ubuntu-phone first

[14:28] <doomlord> ubuntu / google nexus: is there Camera app (stills)
[14:29] <doomlord> ubuntu / ^galaxy nexus: is there Camera app (stills) .. is it likely to work from the outset
[14:33] <Yugge> karanluthra: The sourcecode for the ubuntu-phone project will be released in late february, I think it is closed to canonical employees until then.
[14:36] <popey> yes, there is a camera app
[14:36] <Robbilie> popey do you think canonical might be interested in a "unity-web" version like i did :D
[14:37] <Robbilie> http://jsfiddle.net/Robbilie/7CbDn/24/show/
[14:38] <popey> heh
[14:38] <Robbilie> ?
[14:38] <popey> for what purpose?
[14:39] <Robbilie> showing unity off :)
[14:39] <Robbilie> what it looks and feels like :)
[14:39] <popey> pass
[14:39] <Robbilie> pass?
[14:40] <Robbilie> couldnt you simplay write full sentences instead of single words? :P
[14:41] <popey> pass = I don't know. Commonly used in quiz shows when the contestant doesn't know the answer to the question presented.
[14:42] <Robbilie> well thought smthng like this but didnt know the context :P
[14:42] <Robbilie> do you know who to ask?
[14:43] <popey> pass ☺
[14:43] <Robbilie> damn :D
[14:43] <Robbilie> arent you support? :D
[14:44] <popey> nope
[14:45] <Robbilie> anybody else from the irc team here who could help me then? :D
[14:46] <popey> unlikely on the weekend
[14:46] <popey> try emailing the mailing list?
[14:47] <Robbilie> hum which one? :D never used a mailing list ;)
[14:48] <popey> https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/
[14:50] <Robbilie> hm thanks
[14:53] <Robbilie> should i just mail in or mail "this teams admins"
[14:54] <popey> join the team, subscribe to the list
[14:54] <Robbilie> already done that but after i joines
[14:54] <Robbilie> *joined
[14:54] <popey> email ubuntu-phone@lists.launchpad.net
[15:02] <doomlord> does ubuntu-phone do any of the sandboxing android/ios do
[15:02] <doomlord> (i gather in android every app runs in a seperate user?)
[15:08] <netcurli> doomlord: in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZv7aoiq1Kw jono did talk about sandboxing (at around min 19), that they want to do
[15:09] <popey> thats the plan
[15:20] <M4rtinK> as long as it is user configurable I'm okay with it :)
[15:21] <doomlord> i suppose web apps are already sandboxed by the browser
=== rZr is now known as RzR
[15:37] <popey> depends on the browser surely?
[15:40] <Robbilie> popey, i sent a mail about half an hour ago and nothing changed on the mailing lists website, did i d smthng wrong...?
[15:42] <doomlord> heh. google NaCl for sandboxing native code in the browser :)
[15:43] <popey> Robbilie: did you subscribe to the list first?
[15:43] <Robbilie> sure xD
[15:44] <Robbilie> oh wait i know what the problem is xD
[15:51] <Robbilie> now it works xD
[16:30] <Sinan___> Guys does anyone know that, Since Galaxy Nexus has MHL version 1.0, it doesn't support USB host and HDMI output simultaneously. So how will we use keyboard, mouse and usb storages when we connected to a TV ?
[16:35] <doomlord> i think one wants a wifi NAS box and bluetooth keyboard
[16:35] <Sinan___> what about other unique usb devices?
[16:35] <Sinan___> not just storages
[16:36] <doomlord> i think one wants a propper hub
[16:36] <Sinan___> what kind of proper usb hub? there is no usb host on the device
[16:37] <Sinan___> you can't use usb host and HDMI simultaneously via MHL V1.0
[16:38] <doomlord> ok one wants another phone and port later :)
[16:39] <Sinan___> haha
[16:39] <doomlord> unles one can control things across the network... evreything that matters is networkable i think
[16:39] <doomlord> phones are about wireless connectivity i think
[16:39] <Sinan___> but the problem is ubuntu-phone is fully compatible with ONLY Galaxy Nexus
[16:40] <doomlord> yaeh its a start
[16:40] <doomlord> i want to know what quadcore phone  will get it first
[16:40] <doomlord> that'll be my next purchase
[16:40] <Sinan___> I have a note 2 and I want it to be first :)
[16:40] <doomlord> i'd love a note 2
[16:41] <doomlord> i like nexus 4 benchmarks though
[16:41] <doomlord> so for a pocket computer ..

[18:12] <doomlord> if you dual boot ubuntu/android on nexus7 - is it possible to have shared storage (one accessing others filesys)
[18:13] <doomlord> Sashko depends what phone; andriod SDK is availble everywhwere, and iOS sdk on macintosh
[18:14] <doomlord> android sdk is mostly java
[18:19] <kevkid> hello all!
[18:47] <Sinan___> Sashko: you need eclipse and android sdk
