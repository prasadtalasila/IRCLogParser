[00:00] <mij> I like the automatic window tile, but it doesn't work with multiple workspaces as moving a window next to the window border moves to the adjacent workspace instead of tiling. Any workaround?
[02:02] <xubuntu-anon1> Hello all, I am new here..
[02:02] <xubuntu-anon1> hello... I am looking for a way to promote linux (my favorite flavor is xubuntu), and will be putting on a small promotional event in a month or so, but I need to know, is there a way to show the install process in real time via a projector?
[02:03] <xubuntu-anon1> If anyone has any insight, I would apreciate it...
[02:04] <xubuntu-anon1> It may be a simple answer, as I think I am over looking something... I can't seem to put my finger on it.
[02:08] <well_laid_lawn>  have you got the projector working with the live cd yet?
[02:31] <NickRivers> Hello, when is expected that duplicate filesystem issue will be fixed. Listed here http://xubuntu.org/news/12-10-release
[03:07] <xubuntu-anon1> <well_laid_lawn>  have you got the projector working with the live cd yet? No... unfortunately I do not own one...
[03:07] <xubuntu-anon1> I have to hope the projector I get access to (the day of the event) "just works"...
[03:09] <xubuntu-anon1> I spoke with a friend of mine, and he thinks my Dell 15R I just ordered should work via VGA port, and use th eprojector as the default monitor in this senario
[03:09] <xubuntu-anon1> Thanks for your input, I apreciate it!

[04:28] <ens1> Hello!
[04:29] <ens1> Just have a quick question for the xfce wizards out there :]
[04:29] <ens1> How can I have one xfce panel permanently above another xfce panel? The bottom one spans the entire width of the screen, and the other is only a certain width, and set to autohide. The only problem is that once I click on the bottom panel (the one that spans the entire width), it covers the one that I want to stay on top, making it impossible to get to come out of hiding. How can I set the panel that I want on top to be permanently ov
[05:15] <aperson> are there no keyboard shortcuts switchg tabs in xfce4-terminal ?

[08:53] <DoDiesis> Buongiorno
[08:54] <DoDiesis> Avrei una domanda: all'avvio del sistema si apre sempre, automaticamente, una finestra con il browser Chrome. Quale comando/istruzione devo lanciare affinché questo non si verifichi?
[09:00] <DoDiesis> ok, ripasso più tardi... Un saluto :-)
[10:10] <Ronalds_M> catfish is dependent on zeitgeist?
[10:10] <Ronalds_M> I turned Zeitgeist off, and on, now it doesn't find anything
[10:17] <baizon> Ronalds_M: what search method are you using?
[10:23] <Ronalds_M> well, maybe it's because I'm searching on some partition
[10:23] <Ronalds_M> anyway, Installed gnome-utils
[10:23] <Ronalds_M> and using search util
[10:23] <Ronalds_M> it works faster
[10:23] <Unit193> What's it's backend?
[10:24] <Unit193> If you compare gnome-search locate to catfish find, no kidding it'd be faster.
[10:24] <Ronalds_M> you mean what's installed with it?
[10:24] <Ronalds_M> baobab, some other tools
[10:24] <Ronalds_M> gnome journaling
[10:27] <Ronalds_M> tiling works weird in xfce
[10:27] <Ronalds_M> if you push it to top panel, it doesn't go fullscreen

[11:04] <ubottu> DoDiesis: Vai su #ubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie! (per entrare, scrivi « /join #ubuntu-it » senza virgolette)
[11:05] <DoDiesis> Sorry, I did not know it. I came here through Ubuntu Italia, but I can also write in English,
[11:05] <DoDiesis> May I ask my question?
[11:06] <Myrtti> Of course, you already did
[11:07] <DoDiesis> Why launching xUbuntu 12.04 is at the same time launched the browser Chromium? What could I do to avoid it?
[11:07] <DoDiesis> thanks Myrtti
[11:09] <Myrtti> you must have it in your saved session then, I think
[11:10] <DoDiesis> Myrtti: it is possible, but there is an instruction I could enter via the Terminal in order to avoid this automatic opening?
[11:11] <Unit193> rm -rv ~/.cache/sessions/
[11:19] <DoDiesis> Unit193: it is an indication for me?
[11:20] <Unit193> DoDiesis: That's how you can remove saved sessions, then click log out, look for "save session" and uncheck it, log back in.
[11:21] <DoDiesis> thanks, Unit193 , will follow youtr indication. Sorry for being new for xUbuntu, but now my very old PC seems to have a new life :-)
[11:22] <DoDiesis> Thanks a lot. Have a nice day :-)
[11:22] <DoDiesis> Bye for now :-)
[11:22] <Unit193> Adios.
[11:23] <DoDiesis> Arrivederci... e grazie! :-)

[11:36] <moetunes> !hostname
[11:36] <ubottu> Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hosts to include BOTH the old and new hostname and then change /etc/hostname to the new one. WARNING! Make sure that your current hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly.

[17:34] <samsunghelp> anyone know how to get xubuntu to recognize my samsung galaxy note 2 as an external device so i can transfer music to it? driver support maybe?
[17:34] <samsunghelp> i couldnt find it in the SC
[17:37] <pleia2> samsunghelp: the older androids just mounted it as usb, but you need an MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) app installed now to access data on phones from ICS on
[17:37] <TheSheep> samsunghelp: you need a program that supports MTP
[17:39] <samsunghelp> suggestions on a program to use? or just search MTP in SC?
[17:40] <samsunghelp> qlix looks like bad reviews
[17:40] <pleia2> I've never done it, but searching the SC sounds like a good way to start
[17:40] <samsunghelp> under 2 stars
[17:40] <pleia2> MTP is a finicky technology and it's slow, I anticipate most apps will get poor reviews
[17:41] <samsunghelp> gmtp looks like 3 starts. guess ill try it. thanks for the help. ill see what happens
[17:41] <pleia2> good luck :)
[17:42] <samsunghelp> i forgot but im also a dummy...samsung has kies air and i can just send thru router to phone online. :)
