[13:57] <yeehi> How do I keep the su login for my session  so that I don't have to re-enter it every time i install a package?
[14:05] <geirha> you mean sudo?
[14:05] <geirha> you can configure sudo in various ways. You can for instance say that your user should be able to run sudo apt-get without entering a password
[14:05] <geirha> !sudoers
[14:05] <ubot2> Factoid 'sudoers' not found
[14:06] <geirha> !sudo
[14:06] <ubot2> sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[15:02] <yeehi> The command: sudo sha256 file.tgz requires a passphrase - which passphrase is that? I get gobbledegook when i just hit enter
[15:08] <smartboyhw> yeehi, your password presumably
[15:10] <yeehi> smartboyhw, i enter my su command but then I need another passphrase...
[15:12] <SnowmanX11> yeehi: sudo su - then your password and after you do not need password again.
[15:13] <SnowmanX11> yeehi: you can use root commands without password
[21:31] <yeehi> i installed conky - it says disk: 60% what does this mean? Disk is nowhere near 60 percent full...
[21:53] <geirha> yeehi: It's been ages since I've looked into conky, but I'm guessing it's the default configuration of conky that's a bit weird
[21:53] <geirha> I'm guessing "disk" means "/"
[21:53] <geirha> Did you get your other issue solved?
[21:54] <yeehi> thanks, geirha - i wonder what it could mean... i did spend a bit of time writing over some SDD space during installation, maybe that has something to do with it
[21:54] <yeehi> other issue not solved yet - asking at debian forum - they will know there
[21:56] <geirha> is there a /etc/conkyrc file? or anything in /etc with conky in its name?
[21:56] <geirha> If so, open it in a pager or editor and search for "disk:"
[21:56] <geirha> might give some clues if you combine it with "man conkyrc" (or maybe man conky)
[21:59] <geirha> Anyway, as for the previous issue. Neither sudo or su will ask for a passphrase; they'll ask for a password
[21:59] <geirha> I'm guessing this sha256 command is the one asking for a passphrase. I'm not familiar with that command.
[22:00] <yeehi> thanks geirha - v helpful
[22:21] <yeehi> geirha - one different thing, i keep having to log in as su.  Where do I set it so that i login as su for one session and then stay logged in, eg for synaptic or running terminal commands?
[22:35] <geirha> not possible
[22:35] <geirha> you can configure sudo to not ask for password though
[22:36] <geirha> and we don't really support suing to root
[22:38] <geirha> In ubuntu, you should use sudo rather than su
