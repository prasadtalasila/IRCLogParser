[00:12] <c7p> godbyk: hey
[00:12] <godbyk> Hey, c7p. You're up late!
[00:12] <c7p> :P sorry i couldn't make it
[00:13] <c7p> how did it go ?
[00:13] <godbyk> No problem. The meeting went pretty well.
[00:13] <c7p> \me i'm diving into irc logs
[00:14] <godbyk> Cool
[00:17] <c7p> is you googledoc down ?
[00:17] <godbyk> It's working okay for me at the moment.
[00:18] <c7p> Sorry, the file you have requested does not exist. :/
[00:18] <godbyk> Were you looking at the meeting notes file or the authors/editors spreadsheet?
[00:18] <c7p> yes
[00:18] <godbyk> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLwhH9I_Q9rZw98tovNy97MnC43bBkaGuXZmHz6r3C4/edit
[00:18] <c7p> ahh
[00:18] <c7p> ok now, thx
[00:19] <godbyk> np
[00:24] <c7p> how many people where on channel during meeting ?
[00:24] <godbyk> I don't know. A decent number, though.
[00:25] <c7p> happy for that :D
[00:25] <godbyk> The French had a decent delegation. :-)
[00:25] <c7p> hehe translation teams seems to refresh main project
[00:26] <c7p> i've read quickly the discussion
[00:26] <c7p> i've already sent a message to authors almost a week back, but got 5 responses only
[00:27] <godbyk> Ah, okay.
[00:27] <c7p> so i'll resend it now
[00:27] <godbyk> So it sounds like we may need to find some new authors, eh?
[00:27] <godbyk> Okay.
[00:27] <c7p> and wait how long till we announce openings ?
[00:28] <godbyk> How long do you think we should wait?
[00:29] <godbyk> We probably shouldn't wait longer than a week, I don't think.
[00:29] <c7p> ok
[00:29] <c7p> do we have a spreadsheet for 13.04 ?
[00:29] <godbyk> Hannie linked to it in the chat.
[00:29] <godbyk> Let me find it.
[00:30] <godbyk> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApS28NMLnYJXdGd1LVl5X2hvNkg2SEZiVzZ2RnYtWHc#gid=0
[00:30] <c7p> ahh nice
[00:58] <c7p> hmm, i see some names on 13.04 column
[00:58] <c7p> Joel Pickett, John Cave etc. did someone added them ?
[01:10] <c7p> i've sent the message to those who didn't reply
[01:10] <c7p> and also drop a mail to 2 decent past contributors, Che and Senthil :D
[01:13] <c7p> my first impression is that Working with Ubuntu may need some love from new authors, in worst case
[01:14] <c7p> but i think we are very good at this stage. Also, hopefully we got a very strong editor team
[01:15] <c7p> so in case any author is missing on a section that not much changes, the section doesn't hold back the release
[01:17] <c7p> got to sleep ! big day tomorrow ! good afternoon/night :)
[07:47] <teolemon> #1 and #2 in the linux section
[07:47] <teolemon> http://www.amazon.fr/gp/bestsellers/books/407682/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_4_last
[14:01] <teolemon> we're now #44 in Amazon.fr's computer books section :-)
