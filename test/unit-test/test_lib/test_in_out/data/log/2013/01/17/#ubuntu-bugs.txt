[01:23] <antarus> ok python-gobject just became the worst thing I have ever seen
[01:23] <antarus> and i cannot unsee it :/
[04:19] <savio> what is triage?
[04:19] <savio> can anyone explain me
[04:26] <savio> is today hug day
[04:29] <micahg> savio: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/HowToTriage
[04:29] <savio> micahg, i read it once but i don't understand where to start
[04:30] <savio> or what to do with bug report
[04:32] <micahg> I'm about to head to sleep, so I don't think I can walk you through the process, but maybe someone else will come along soon
[04:36] <savio> micahg, thanks for your help though
[04:36] <savio> right now i'm on this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/transmission/+bug/703221
[04:36] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 703221 in transmission (Ubuntu) ""Verify Local Data" does not check file size" [Undecided,New]
[04:37] <savio> now figuring out the next step ????
[05:12] <savio> does while processing bug did we need to reproduce the bug?
[05:15] <savio> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/transmission/+bug/1096815
[05:15] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1096815 in transmission (Ubuntu) "installed 'transmission' program crashed when accessing speed-settings" [Undecided,New]
[05:15] <savio> what to do next?
[06:12] <om26er> Bug Day, lets get started
[06:36] <antarus> om26er: so I am looking to fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/bash/+bug/778627 for Precise
[06:36] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 778627 in bash (Ubuntu) "In natty, bash completion now quotes shell variable references rather than expanding them" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[06:37] <antarus> for SRU I need to fix it in P, Q and R, correct?
[06:38]  * antarus has no idea if it is still broken in R or Q
[06:40] <om26er> antarus, first you would need to fix it in R then you may backport
[06:40] <antarus> om26er: and if it works in R already?
[06:55] <antarus> om26er: I downloaded the bash for R and Q, it is fixed there
[06:55] <antarus> om26er: am I allowed to simply backport from Q to P in this case?
[06:56] <antarus> (I presume I just want to backport the one readline patch that fixes this bug, and nothing else?)
[07:07] <om26er> antarus, sorry i was in the shower, if its not an issue in R then just propose a backport
[07:08] <om26er> antarus, you would need someone for a code review, maybe the developers of bash itself.
[07:09] <antarus> om26er: my aim is to do it and get it sponsored, so I can get it SRU'd
[07:09] <antarus> I'm just not sure what the backport entails
[07:09] <antarus> are you just looking for a debdiff of the P package witht he readline patch included?
[07:09] <om26er> antarus, to get it quickly sponsored you may want to go with the patch pilot it will make it quite efficient for your fix to get uploaded
[07:10] <om26er> antarus, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/CodeReviews
[07:10] <om26er> or precisely https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/CodeReviews#Patch_Pilots
[07:13] <antarus> om26er: I guess I'm unsure what the patch is supposed to include. I can clone the bzr and submit something, or I can apt-get source and build a debdiff; is there one that is preferred?
[07:15] <om26er> antarus, i'll go with former
[07:21] <antarus> Thanks
[09:53] <mcclurmc> i just found, fixed and submitted a patch for a bug in indicator-weather. can anyone review and apply it for me? https://bugs.launchpad.net/indicator-weather/+bug/1100680

[16:50] <Kalidarn> ah crap :( accidentally filed a bug in the wrong place
[16:50] <Kalidarn> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-fsevents-daemon/+bug/1100846
[16:50] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1100846 in Ubuntu One FsEvents daemon "Backport pcmanfm 1.1.0 - pcmanfm can't open files with hash (#) in their filename" [Undecided,New]
[16:50] <Kalidarn> its got nothing to do with FsEvents daemon
[16:50] <Kalidarn> can i fix this?
[16:51] <Kalidarn> i think i have to close it as invalid
[16:51] <Kalidarn> and open an new one, doesn't seem you can remove "affects"
[16:52] <Kalidarn> oh wait maybe i can
[16:52] <hjd> Kalidarn: Sure, click the arrow next to the package name and enter a different package name :)
[16:53] <Kalidarn> yeah
[16:54] <Kalidarn> does that look right hjd https://bugs.launchpad.net/pcmanfm/+bug/1100846
[16:54] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1100846 in PCManFM "Backport pcmanfm 1.1.0 - pcmanfm can't open files with hash (#) in their filename" [Undecided,New]
[16:54] <Kalidarn> maybe the case is wrong :S cos it's not linking to the right thing
[16:55] <Kalidarn> oh wait, it shouldn't matter, i think that's right :P
[16:58] <hjd> Kalidarn: That's the pcmanfm project, not the ubuntu package. What you probably want to to is select distribution: Ubuntu, package: pcmanfm.
[17:01] <hjd> The project field is used if the upstream project use Launchad for tracking bugs and you wish to notify them, or in some cases where you can track a bug reported elsewhere (for instance GNOME).
[17:01] <Kalidarn> oh oops :P
[17:01] <Kalidarn> yeah it won't let me change it now
[17:03] <Kalidarn> sorry for mucking that up :P - should be in bed :D
[17:05] <hjd> Actually since this is regarding a backport, it's possible it should be assigned to one of the backport projects instead. Have you read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports#Requesting_a_Backport? :)
[17:12] <Kalidarn> i might have missed that page ;)
[17:13] <Kalidarn> the package is already built and in the daily ppa though
[17:13] <Kalidarn> so i assume it would be that one that one which gets backported.
[17:14] <Kalidarn> no doubt the maintainer plans to do it shortly anyway for other reasons
[17:15] <dkessel> Hello. I have submitted kernel bug 1100004 and I have a question on the additional information to provide when sending this bug upstream.
[17:15] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1100004 in linux (Ubuntu) "compal-laptop reports bluetooth device, even if there is none" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100004
[17:15] <mfisch> anyone else doing the hug day?
[17:15] <dkessel> do you think it would be ok to reference the launchpad bug page, as it already contains all the additional files which may be needed?
[17:15] <hjd> Looking at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pcmanfm, I see version 1.1.0-0ubuntu2 is available in the development version of the next Ubuntu release, so I would assume that would the package which is backported to older releases.
[17:15] <hjd> Kalidarn: ^
[17:24] <dkessel> hggdh, do you have a moment? what would you do if you would file the kernel bug (above) upstream? would you attach the BIOS files etc. again, or would you reference the launchpad bug's URL for all the files which may be needed?
