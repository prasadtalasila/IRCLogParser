[10:51] <java_lfs> A "seek" with offset larger than 2GB (-1)  does not work under Ubuntu 10.04 32Bit. But in the bash shell I can easily cat a 8 GB file. How can I fix this 2GB barrier in Java?
[10:51] <java_lfs> .seek(1024*1024*1024*2-1); Result: OK. .seek(1024*1024*1024*2); Result: java.io.IOException: Negative seek offset
[10:53] <java_lfs> I would like to use Large File Support in Java, without the need to switch to a 64Bit JVM. Is this possible ?
[11:37] <java_lfs> anyone there ?
