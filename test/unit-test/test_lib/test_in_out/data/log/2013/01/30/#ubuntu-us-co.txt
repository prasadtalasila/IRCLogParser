[23:30] <joey> w00t, my hexbrights came today

[23:30] <joey> FOSS arduino based flashlight
[23:33] <FunnyLookinHat> ooooh
[23:33] <FunnyLookinHat> I literally never thought I'd see the day that someone built an open-source flashlight...
[23:33] <FunnyLookinHat> haha
[23:47] <joey> they are sweet
[23:47] <joey> I backed them a long time ago on kickstarter
[23:47] <joey> 1 hour on 500 lumens (high), 8 hours on med, 30 hours on low
[23:47] <joey> plus you can control the motion detection + button functions
[23:48]  * med_ looks around and sees it's not hom
[23:48] <med_> him
[23:50]  * med_ highlights on med
[23:50] <med_> and reading the line highlighted, I thought that was a cooking recipe. I somehow thought you were grilling something on your LED flashlight.
