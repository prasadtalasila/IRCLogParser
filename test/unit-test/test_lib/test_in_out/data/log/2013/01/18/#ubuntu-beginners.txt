[00:00] <PhysicsBrain> Great! How can I do it? Canyou help me fella?
[00:00] <holstein> PhysicsBrain: i would just boot the live CD, and open the file with the text editor of your choice... the one that you used to edit it in the first place should do
[00:01] <holstein> PhysicsBrain: fix it back, and reboot
[00:02] <PhysicsBrain> Ok. Let me see! I have to boot with the live CD, open the file and edit. but, where is it in the test mode of the live CD?
[00:02] <holstein> PhysicsBrain: ?
[00:03] <holstein> PhysicsBrain: it'll be right there on your hard drive.. assuming you arent using encryption, you open it from the live CD and edit it
[00:03] <PhysicsBrain> How I access my HD from there?
[00:03] <holstein> PhysicsBrain: you'll see it in the file manager..
[00:04] <PhysicsBrain> OK. I'll try. Thank you fella!

[13:10] <yeehi>  I have a large library of mp3 files I want to compress. Which is the most efficient way to zip them, to save space? Quality? Speed?
[13:11] <yeehi> mp3 is already compressed
[13:15] <histo> yeehi: well if you don't want to compress them you could use tar
[13:15] <histo> yeehi: or you could tar gzip if you want to.
[13:17] <histo> !best | yeehi
[13:17] <ubot2> yeehi: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[13:21] <yeehi> thanks for that histo! I didn't know about ubuntu-bots - how would i format a question in #ubuntu-bots?

[15:49] <jonny2> Hello. I wanted to use Pendrivelinux and bought a 8g Flash drive. I didnt want to use all 8g for my linux would I be able to partion it so that I can have 4g available for other uses?
[16:06] <holstein> jonny2: heres what i do
[16:06] <holstein> i just install to the USB sticks.. as if ther are normal media
[16:06] <holstein> i dont use an persistent setup.. or any pendrive anything.. i just install
[16:07] <jonny2> holstein: So you mean by removing the HD and doing the instalation into the USB
[16:08] <holstein> jonny2: if you want to remove the hard drive, but you dont have to .. you can just not change the hard drive
[16:08] <holstein> !grub2
[16:08] <ubot2> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[16:08] <holstein> jonny2: the grub install can be tricky.. i just put grub on the USB stick
[16:08] <holstein> jonny2: i would say, just grab unetbootin, and put a live distro on the stick, and see what your needs are
[16:09] <holstein> jonny2: you can use the space on the unetbootin
[16:10] <jonny2> Thanks holstein.
[16:13] <jonny2> Oh one more thing Holstein can this work for any flavor of linux like red hat?
[16:13] <holstein> jonny2: unetbootin supports many distros
[16:14] <holstein> jonny2: all distros are likely to have a "supported" way to use a USB stick
[16:14] <holstein> jonny2: i have used it with fedora many times
[16:14] <jonny2> Thanks

[19:24] <earthling_> hi, how do I tell what wireless card I have on my laptop?
[19:30] <earthling_> I think I found it
[19:31] <earthling_> how do I turn on my BCM4312 Broadcom wireless card?
[19:31] <Unit193> !bcm | earthling_
[19:31] <ubot2> earthling_: Help with Broadcom bcm43xx can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
[19:31] <Unit193> Pretty easy, considering.
[19:32] <earthling_> I'll check it out
[19:32] <earthling_> thx
[19:32] <Unit193> I have one of those.
[19:36] <earthling_> it says my pci-id is supported for (2.6.33+)
[19:37] <earthling_> that is the kernel version?
[19:38] <Unit193> Kernel version in quantal is 3.5.0-21
[19:40] <earthling_> Im using lucid live usb
[20:45] <geirha> lucid has a 3.2 kernel
[21:44] <Geothst> I'm getting some errors on my splash screen when I boot up but they're just kinda randomly all over the screen and I don't have time to read exactly what the errors are. is there a way to pull up boot-up errors after the fact?
[21:45] <geirha> It depends on what stage of the boot they occur, but if it's late enough in the boot, check /var/log/boot.log
[21:56] <Geothst> It looks like everything on here has an [ok] after it.
[22:08] <Geothst> It says could not write bytes: broken pipe, then it says lots of stuff... starting crash report submission daemon, hardware RNG device inode not found, cannot find hardware RNG device to use, topping save kernel messages, sane disabled: edit /etc/default/saned
[22:09] <Geothst> Oh that's weird. that didn't go through.
[22:23] <geirha> ok, something weird is going on there, but not enough information to suggest what
[22:35] <Geothst> It's a fairly fresh install. I am trying to install steam but it's not working. I installed the very latest beta nvidia drivers.
[22:35] <Geothst> synaptic, xchat, GIMP, inkscape, normal stuff. I haven't done anything wild yet.
