[00:46] <mrafcho001> I'm having an issue with the python-qt4 package. It wont install due to dependency on sip-api-8.1, which seems to be some kind of a virtual package provided by python-sip... which is already installed. Does anyone know whats going on?
[00:50] <sbivol> mrafcho001: which Kubuntu version and PyQt4 version?
[00:51] <mrafcho001> Kubuntu 12.10 and the package is python-qt4 (4.9.3-4)
[00:51] <ovidiu-florin> mrafcho001: do you get an error on apt-get update ?
[00:52] <mrafcho001> ovidiu-florin: I do not
[00:52] <sbivol> mrafcho001: I have the same setup as you, with python-sip 4.13.3-2
[00:53] <mrafcho001> I have same version installed as well
[00:54] <sbivol> if you haven't forced any package installation, there should be no problem at all
[00:54] <ovidiu-florin> in case you have a dependency problem try apt-get -f install
[00:55] <ovidiu-florin> it shoul install any missing dependencies
[00:55] <mrafcho001> On a closer look I see I have version 4.14-5~exp1... hmm
[00:56] <sbivol> mrafcho001: maybe you used some PPA to install a newer version of the package
[00:57] <mrafcho001> How can I tell which PPA is the origin of the package?
[00:59] <yofel> mrafcho001: apt-cache policy <package>
[01:01] <sbivol> yofel: nice!
[01:01] <mrafcho001> oh how interesting, I think the software I'm trying to install (Calibre) is the one thats breaking everything, since the 4.14-5~exp1 package originates from there, yet it breaks python-qt4 which is required by Calibre.
[01:02] <ovidiu-florin> yofel: I should remember that command :D thank's
[01:02] <ovidiu-florin> mrafcho001: how are you installing calibre?
[01:03] <mrafcho001> ovidiu-florin: PPA... ppa:n-muench/calibre
[01:03] <yofel> mrafcho001: tell the PPA owner that he can't just backport SIP, he needs to rebuild everything that uses it
[01:04] <mrafcho001> yofel: meanwhile, any way to remove all packages from that PPA?
[01:04] <yofel> (which IIRC is only python-qt)
[01:04] <yofel> ppa-purge can do that
[01:04] <ovidiu-florin> yofel: can you give an example of that command?
[01:05] <yofel> uh, I think it's just ppa-purge ppa:owner/ppa
[01:05] <yofel> haven't used it in a long time
[01:06] <ovidiu-florin> and that restores all changed packages to the version they were before the ppa waas added?
[01:06] <ovidiu-florin> or removed?
[01:06] <ovidiu-florin> I mean removes the packages from that ppa?
[01:07] <yofel> "       This script provides a bash shell script capable of automatically downgrading all packages in a given PPA back to the ubuntu versions."
[01:08] <ovidiu-florin> what about the paackages that aren't in the ubuntu ppa's? and that were added from that ppa?
[01:09] <mrafcho001> yofel: I just tried, it and it did not downgrade my python-sip. I ended up manually purging it.
[01:09] <yofel> ovidiu-florin: I don't know
[01:09] <mrafcho001> more interestingly, it did not disable the PPA... I was able to install calibre  without re-adding the PPA
[01:10] <ovidiu-florin> calibre is in the official ubuntu repos
[01:10] <ovidiu-florin> or in the partner, I don't know exactly
[01:11] <mrafcho001> ovidiu-florin: Good catch!

[07:06] <RadSurfer> Does anyone know how to clear the "authorization" data when trying to access a file-share folder?
[07:06] <RadSurfer> If you key in wrong thing, it doesn't seem to let you ERASE it...
[07:08] <gnomefreak> RadSurfer: change owner, but IIRC you need the paswrd to unlock it and change ownershio of file
[07:08] <RadSurfer> What file?
[07:08] <RadSurfer> I just want to delete/reset all data for that "authorization" dialog box for that particular file-share
[07:09] <gnomefreak> oh
[07:09] <RadSurfer> Using Dolphin to drag/drop files; but data that went into initial"Authorization" was all wrong
[07:09] <RadSurfer> now its hung up and won't work... so there must be a way to ERASE that wrong entrys
[07:11] <RadSurfer> Does anyone know what I'm talking about? & how to fix this?
[07:16] <user94202> how do i delete autologin and passwords for websites in Konqueror?
[07:16] <user94202> it keeps logging into ebay with my password. I want to delete that.
[07:48] <phoenix_firebrd> bookmarks shows up in the kmenu and krunner, how do i distable that
[07:52] <tsimpson> phoenix_firebrd: right click the kmenu icon, click on Application Launcher Menu Settings, deselect the Bookmarks option. similar for krunner, click the settings icon on the far left, deselect Bookmarks
[07:57] <soapee01> anyone else seeing X go NUTS and warnings about lsb_release not found even though it exists. Especially X though at 100%?
[07:58] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: there is no such option as Application Launcher Menu Settings,  there is one called Application Launcher settings, but that doesn't contain options for bookmarks. The krunner solution works
[07:59] <tsimpson> phoenix_firebrd: ah, you have the newfangled Launcher, I don't think you can stop it from searching bookmarks there (at least I don't know of one)
[07:59] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: 100% of what?
[08:00] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: oops, sorry i should have told you first, i am using kde 4.9.97
[08:01] <tsimpson> phoenix_firebrd: yeah, but there are 2 launchers available and I use the "Classic Menu Style"
[08:02] <soapee01> phoenix_firebird. I have an 8 core 16gb machine that becomes unusable after 3 days. X goes nuts one one core.
[08:02] <tsimpson> like the old kmenu
[08:02] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: oh
[08:02] <soapee01> machine is alive via ssh phoneix_firebird; however graphics, not so much.
[08:02] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: kubuntu version?
[08:03] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: any particular reason why they removed this option
[08:03] <phoenix_firebrd> ?
[08:03] <soapee01> precise
[08:04] <soapee01> but honestly kde4 has been massively unstable for me
[08:04] <soapee01> kde 2 was much better and that was a piece of shit.
[08:04] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: using any propitiatory graphics driver?
[08:04] <soapee01> oh fuck all that of course
[08:04] <soapee01> this isn't 1999
[08:04] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: also is the cpu overclocked?
[08:05] <soapee01> no
[08:05] <soapee01> i never do
[08:05] <FloodBotK1> soapee01: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:05] <soapee01> I'm not flooding damn bot
[08:05] <soapee01> it's nvidia modest graphics
[08:05] <soapee01> let me lspci
[08:06] <soapee01> lspci | grep -i nvidia
[08:06] <soapee01> 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GT218 [GeForce 210] (rev a2)
[08:07] <soapee01> lsmod |grep nv
[08:07] <soapee01> nvidia              11283521  30
[08:07] <soapee01> it's not video though. it's CPU.
[08:07] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: do you know that we don't support proprietary stuff here
[08:08] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: proprietary driver could crash the xserver and that could lead to the cpu being high.
[08:08] <tsimpson> phoenix_firebrd: I don't think it was removed, it just never existed
[08:09] <soapee01> phoenix_firebrd you know the proprietary drivers for nvidia are in the repos?
[08:09] <soapee01> and you know that's not my fucking problem?
[08:09] <soapee01> I've been using debian since potato.
[08:09] <soapee01> this didn't happen on lucid (kde) on the same machine.
[08:09] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: I am wondering how it could read my bookmarks from my chromium browser
[08:09] <soapee01> but ubuntu does so much weird shit
[08:09] <soapee01> on the desktop
[08:10] <soapee01> it makes it really hard to track shit down.
[08:10] <Tm_T> soapee01: please calm down and cut the cursing
[08:11] <soapee01> Tm_T I'm not upset honestly.
[08:11] <soapee01> it's just an issue, and I'm profane.
[08:11] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: during installation of the proprietary stuff you should have come across a leagal notice that says canonical doesn't support it
[08:12] <Ab3L> soapee01: i've logged in too late and have an nvidia. could you make me up to date? can you remember me what is your problem?
[08:13] <soapee01> phoenix_firebrd really?
[08:13] <soapee01> that is not my problem.
[08:13] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: it is simple, uninstall the propitiatory driver and check and if the x crashes
[08:13] <soapee01> honestly, if you don't know, don't offer advice phoenix_firebrd
[08:14] <soapee01> it's not a driver issue
[08:14] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: its Nvidia's problem , you should consult them
[08:14] <Tm_T> soapee01: cut the attitude please
[08:14] <soapee01> no, it isn't
[08:14] <soapee01> it's not how the software works.
[08:15] <soapee01> I see it on a laptop with nouvoue as well.
[08:15] <phoenix_firebrd> soapee01: If you had tested the system without the propitiatory driver and still the X crashes , then we can help you
[08:15] <soapee01> x isn't crashing.
[08:16] <soapee01> if it did, I'd have log files
[08:16] <soapee01> it just goes to 100% cpu (on one core)
[08:17] <soapee01> and it's irritating.  I have to restart precise every few days like I did windows 98.
[08:17] <soapee01> and I've been using Linux since 1999. This has been the most unstable release I've ever seen.
[08:19] <soapee01> I'm also fighting an install on an IBM server (so says my client), but I'll believe that when I get KVM access.
[08:26] <copacetic> The display settings application does not save my changes past a reboot, how can I make it do this?
[08:34] <soapee01> copacetic: idk for sure these days but it used to be dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

[10:14] <rork> it would be helpfull though if you could share the information ;)
[10:20] <jussi> I suppose: /usr/share/wallpapers
[10:20] <jussi> :)
[10:20] <Peace-> ~/.kde/share/wallpaper

[13:34] <bartar3d> hi all
[13:34] <monkeyjuice> hello bartar3d
[13:34] <bartar3d> hey, monkeyjuice, how are you?
[13:35] <monkeyjuice> not to bad , keeping warm
[13:35] <bartar3d> :-), I try to
[13:36] <bartar3d> I've ran into some sort of an issue here, concerning mounting drives..
[13:37] <monkeyjuice> and what would that be
[13:38] <bartar3d> I've got my music collection on external drive, and even though the drive is auto-mounted on boot, no player seems to find it back, and I have to reselect the directory on each boot
[13:38] <bartar3d> same happens with callibre, when I start it, it seems not to be able to read the library, which also is on an external drive
[13:38] <bartar3d> they are mounted though
[13:38] <bartar3d> and accessible from dolphin
[13:42] <monkeyjuice> once you reselect it  then it works fine?
[13:42] <bartar3d> yep
[13:42] <monkeyjuice> hmmm a bit strange
[13:42] <BluesKaj> bartar3d, have you tried adding the drive to fstab or perhaps linking your external drive music folder to your /home/user dir
[13:42] <invariant> bartar3d, are you sure that's not a powersaving feature?
[13:42] <invariant> bartar3d, because mine does the same thing by design.
[13:43] <bartar3d> you mean, the powersaving feature invariant?
[13:44] <BluesKaj> bartar3d, ??
[13:44] <invariant> bartar3d, to test this, start a terminal, go to the right directory and do ls.
[13:44] <invariant> bartar3d, if it returns an answer immediately, then calibre should also work.
[13:45] <invariant> bartar3d, you can tell BluesKaj that he has me on ignore.
[13:45] <invariant> bartar3d, if it doesn't you know that while mounted, it's just in power-saving mode. (this is a hardware feature)
[13:46] <bartar3d> ok, BluesKaj, you seem to have invariant on ignore...
[13:46] <bartar3d> ok, well the drive does shut down automagically after the computer is shut down, but it does start again too when I start the computer
[13:47] <bartar3d> I didn't have this problem on 12.04
[13:47] <bartar3d> Now I'm on 12.10
[13:47] <invariant> bartar3d, can you answer the experiment I devised?
[13:48] <invariant> bartar3d, GUI programs can do all kinds of things to hide reality in their efforts to make it easier for the user (that never works)
[13:49] <BluesKaj> ok , bartar3d , I'll backoff
[13:49] <bartar3d> invariant, well, right now it does show up imediatly, but I'd better check after a reboot
[13:50] <invariant> bartar3d, it has nothing to do with a reboot.
[13:50] <invariant> bartar3d, it has to do with a lack of diskactivity.
[13:50] <invariant> bartar3d, if you don't write anything to it for a few hours, it will go in sleep mode.
[13:50] <bartar3d> hmm, and how to keep it active?
[13:51] <invariant> bartar3d, it's still mounted, but any response will take a longer time (30 seconds or so)
[13:51] <bartar3d> no, that's not the problem, I'm sure
[13:51] <bartar3d> they were were persistent
[13:51] <invariant> bartar3d, simple: you execute the command while sleep 300; do touch /mnt/foo/bar; done
[13:52] <invariant> bartar3d, unless your hardware is broken, this is simply how it works.
[13:52] <invariant> bartar3d, calibre is not going to behave anything different from other applications.
[13:53] <bartar3d> then the only reason for my hardware to break, would have been the upgrade, which sounds not quite reasonable
[13:53] <invariant> bartar3d, which is why it's not a likely hypothesis.
[13:53] <invariant> bartar3d, in short... just look at the problem for some time.
[13:54] <invariant> bartar3d, you will either provide evidence contradicting what I said or you will see that I was right.
[13:55] <bartar3d> ok, maybe it's right, it sounds logical, sleep-mode.. but it does take quite a bit longer to wake pu
[13:55] <bartar3d> *up
[13:56] <bartar3d> and it must have been activated by a change in default configuration between 12.04 and 12.10
[14:01] <BluesKaj> barbar , have you tried linking pertinent files to your ~/
[14:02] <bartar3d> No BluesKaj, with my new info, I'll first test things a little, and then try out other solutions, now I need to get some things done
[14:12] <BluesKaj> bartar3d, I added my external drive to fstab by finding the correct device with fdisk -l, then doing sudo blkid to copy the proper string to fstab like so ," UUID=34ab43d0-f91e-4c5e-8e61-c1ccc7306839 /media/External ext4    defaults        0       2 " ...without quotes of course

[14:43] <DarkSim> Hello! :)
[14:44] <DarkSim> First time to try KDE for me, hope it's good
[14:45] <invariant> DarkSim, which version are you running?
[14:45] <DarkSim> Ubuntu 12.04
[14:46] <DarkSim> The thing that scared me from trying was that I heard it was a) slow and b) not so pretty
[14:47] <DarkSim> I've almost tried all DE's there are so I guess it's time to give KDE a roll
[14:47] <sbivol> DarkSim: you _really_ should give Kubuntu 12.10 a try, or even 13.04 if you feel adventurous.
[14:47] <DarkSim> It's hard to downgrade
[14:47] <DarkSim> last time I upgraded to 12.10 basically everything went crashing down on me
[14:48] <DarkSim> My BURG, applications, system crashes on everything
[14:48] <DarkSim> it was a complete mess
[14:48] <DarkSim> and I'm a newbie too so it's not that nice to troubleshoot literally the whole computer
[14:49] <DarkSim> So I've tried Unity, Xfce, Lxde, Pantheon and even Gnome 3
[14:49] <DarkSim> Let's see if KDE is the miracle and wonder I've been hearing about recently ;)
[14:50] <DarkSim> I just wish something like KDE or Xfce could generally look like Unity or Gnome 3 when it comes to polish, because honestly, Gnome 3 looks gorgeous to me
[14:50] <DarkSim> I know, I know, people hate me for even considering Gnome 3
[14:53] <DarkSim> Got a little freaked out since I had no start button or anything, thankfully I could find it lol
[14:55] <zedority> have you got kde installed now?
[14:55] <sbivol> DarkSim: Take yout time, head to IRC when you have a question, and you'll hopefully find the KDE experience very nice
[14:55] <DarkSim> sbivol, just a wonder, have you for instance seen the..I think it's called verify window
[14:55] <DarkSim> you know you start something and it asks for your password, root access and all that
[14:56] <DarkSim> have you seen that in Gnome 3, that window, the style and all? Can KDE achieve that?
[14:57] <sbivol> DarkSim: I've never used Gnome 3, since Gnome 2 I moved on to KDE
[14:57] <DarkSim> Yeah, but...let me fetch you a screenshot
[14:58] <ScottyK> Greetings! I saw that amarok 2.7 has been released. How long to you think it will be until it appears in the regular repos for 12.10?
[15:02] <sbivol> ScottyK: I think it's been packaged for kubuntu already, try looking for a PPA, like this one: ppa:kubuntu-ppa/beta
[15:02] <yofel> sbivol, ScottyK: wait
[15:03] <yofel> that has the amarok beta + kde 4.10 rc2
[15:03] <yofel> ScottyK: 2.7 can be found in ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports
[15:04] <ScottyK> Is using programs from the backports "safe", or is it reasonably stable?
[15:05] <yofel> maybe not completely safe, but reasonably stable
[15:06] <ScottyK> ok, i'll give it a try. thanks!
[15:07] <sbivol> ScottyK: I use pre-release versions of KDE for my main computer  (even today I upgraded via http://ppa.launchpad.net/kubuntu-ppa/staging/ubuntu), and it never lets me down. the Kubuntu packagers do a great job.
[15:09] <yofel> sbivol: please NEVER mention the staging PPA outside -devel. It's not meant for public use
[15:09] <sbivol> yofel: sorry, I'll keep in mind.
[15:10] <yofel> (we keep work-in-progress packages there, if you use it while we work on them it's likely that you'll break your system)
[15:11] <invariant> They are keeping all the working versions for themselves!!
[15:12] <sbivol> yofel: I've used KDE 4.0. A system can never be more „work in progress” than that :-)
[15:13] <yofel> well, true. Let's rather say that you loose warranty by using it ^^
[15:14] <DarkSim> wtf is up with KDE forcing me to have some random web browser on my taskbar?

[15:14] <yofel> DarkSim: uh, you can always remove the launcher
[15:14] <DarkSim> I do, but it comes back
[15:14] <yofel> o.O
[15:15] <yofel> now that shouldn't happen
[15:15] <DarkSim> As soon as I make a change in Task Manager Settings
[15:15] <DarkSim> it just pops back up
[15:15] <invariant> DarkSim, if you use 12.04 without any updates, like the backports, that's a bad idea.
[15:15] <DarkSim> Like in Windows 7 when it's pinned to the taskbar for quick launch
[15:15] <DarkSim> I'm not using a backport
[15:15] <DarkSim> I just use the latest 12.04
[15:15] <yofel> yeah, but removing the launcher isn't supposed to bring it back
[15:15] <invariant> DarkSim, then do so immediately.
[15:16] <yofel> invariant: 4.8 is still supposed to work right
[15:16] <invariant> yofel, do you backport all fixes?
[15:16] <DarkSim> It also randomly puts two windows together on top of each other on the taskbar as well
[15:16] <DarkSim> So much problem within the first minutes, sigh
[15:17] <yofel> invariant: well, it has the fixes that are in 4.8.5 + some cherry-picked ones. Of course not everything that's in 4.9
[15:17] <invariant> DarkSim, for your own health, go with the above referred backports repo.
[15:18] <yofel> DarkSim: ok, *that* is kind a known issue (on some systems)
[15:18] <yofel> *kind of
[15:18] <yofel> 4.9 might help there. Not sure as I don't use the default task manager
[15:18] <DarkSim> Bit sad it coughs up so many problems all at once
[15:18] <DarkSim> no other DM has given me these kind of problems that fast
[15:20] <invariant> DarkSim, we already know how much it sucked in 4.8.
[15:21] <invariant> Or rather, I know. yofel needs some convincing.
[15:21]  * yofel didn't say that 4.9 doesn't work better
[15:22] <invariant> I don't quite get this attitude where stable software is more buggy.
[15:22] <DarkSim> I'm not accusing anyone
[15:22] <invariant> It's as if developers have no confidence that later versions are not superior to previous versions.
[15:22] <invariant> If you don't believe in yourself, why should anyone else do that then?
[15:23] <DarkSim> I'm sorry, ok
[15:23] <yofel> I think he's talking to me
[15:24] <invariant> I also run Debian Stable still on some desktop system, but it's quite unbearable.
[15:24] <BluesKaj> DarkSim, it's not you , just ignore the and don't feed the troll
[15:24] <DarkSim> Cant I bind the start button to Meta/Super?
[15:24] <yofel> well, that has 4.4 IIRC - which *is* old (has a working kdepim suite though)
[15:24] <DarkSim> I don't want to mash half my keyboard to bring up the start menu
[15:24] <invariant> yofel, I don't use KDE on that machine.
[15:25] <yofel> DarkSim: you'll need to use meta/super+some_other_key
[15:25] <yofel> DarkSim: in KDE meta/super is just a modifier, not a shortcut by itself
[15:25] <DarkSim> That's not good :/
[15:25] <invariant> DarkSim, because of some silly technical excuse which KDE developers make your windows key cannot be used to bring up the start menu.
[15:26] <invariant> They say that because QT simply doesn't work like that, that they don't support it.
[15:26] <DarkSim> :/
[15:26] <invariant> However, QT is open-source and they control the whole operating system.
[15:26] <invariant> This is #kubuntu afterall.
[15:27] <invariant> Meanwhile, I am the troll according to BluesKaj...
[15:27] <yofel> kubuntu tries to stick to KDE for such things (even if I agree that it's annoying)
[15:27] <invariant> yofel, I wonder why....
[15:28] <invariant> yofel, perhaps because they have no idea about software development?
[15:28] <invariant> yofel, the Kubuntu people, that is.
[15:28] <DarkSim> Can I add a caption to the start button as well?
[15:28] <yofel> invariant: I'm a kubuntu-dev myself. We simply try to stick to KDE as soon as possible - randomly patching KDE is already done by other distros
[15:28] <yofel> *as close as
[15:29] <invariant> yofel, there are lots of alternative designs possible too to make it easy to use the start menu with the keyboard.
[15:29] <invariant> Perhaps you are busy fixing all the bugs you have introduced before.
[15:31] <yofel> sticking close to kde has the advantage of being able to blame them for most of those, but we're a small enough team that we're busy even without trying to track down every single bug we see
[15:31] <DarkSim> So far KDE looks better than I expected, but it's customization is mildly speaking a pain, worth noting
[15:32] <john__> Good day! Somebody please take a look at this screenshots of KDE 4.10 B1:
[15:32] <john__> http://imgur.com/a/QS5Gs
[15:32] <john__> See the transparency glitches?
[15:32] <john__> This is from kubuntu 13.04
[15:33] <john__> expected or should I report a bug?
[15:34] <yofel> john__: 13.04 support is in #ubuntu+1, but the only system I'M seing that on is a 12.04 VM (kvm) running 4.9.97 - all other systems are fine.
[15:35] <BluesKaj> john__, there's a large update/upgrade in the works today , have you done so yet ?
[15:35] <john__> yes, seems so, minutes ago
[15:35] <john__> distro-upgrade
[15:35] <BluesKaj> john__, also 13.04 support is at #ubuntu+1
[15:36] <DarkSim> I have a general idea of most DE's now
[15:36] <DarkSim> It's hard to pick a favorite
[15:37] <john__> okay, tkx
[15:37] <BluesKaj> I was missing some toolbar and menu options before the upgrade and they're restored now
[15:37] <yofel> DarkSim: from my experience one ends up picking the one that gets in the way the least when working
[15:38] <BluesKaj> john__, ^ so there may be some otherfixes that may affect you but unfortunately a reboot is required
[15:39] <DarkSim> I know people want me to die in a fire, but Gnome 3 has given me the most pleasant experience yet
[15:39] <DarkSim> The biggest surprise really
[15:39] <DarkSim> Xfce is the best DE for pure Windows-ish workstyle and is very blunt, not that beautiful
[15:40] <DarkSim> KDE comes close, but I still like Xfce just a little itty bitty bit more
[15:40] <DarkSim> Cinnamon is really cool, but it crashes ALL the time
[15:41] <ScottyK> my 7 year old son is a big fan of KDE. On his side of the kid's computer, he has his desktop loaded with widgets..
[15:41] <DarkSim> All my opinions, so I respect your disrespect
[15:43] <DarkSim> If I could create something which looks like Gnome 3 in KDE it would be a instant win, because I like customization, but the general layout and polish on the UI which Gnome 3 is just so.. wow
[15:44] <DarkSim>  my mouse just locked, brilliant
[15:44] <jimbob6996> LOL
[15:45] <jimbob6996> sometimes you can unlock it with the exc key
[15:45] <jimbob6996> but not often
[15:46] <OerHeks> gnome-issue, i guess
[15:48] <jimbob6996> not sure about it being a gnome issue
[15:48] <BluesKaj> <old windows guy , prefer the familiarity KDE gives me
[15:49] <jimbob6996> it's been happening to me off and on since the upgrade to 12.10
[15:50] <jimbob6996> though I've narrowed it down to when the priview image comes up with a mouse over
[16:33] <BluesKaj> BBL, gotta push some snow
[16:41] <jimbob6996> snow :O
[16:47] <insanitywolf> has anyone tried kubuntu in samsung ativ smart pc pro?
[16:48] <soee> what is the command to edit text file inside terminal ?
[16:50] <Kottizen> soee: nano <file>
[16:54] <jimbob6996> to end text file?
[16:54] <jimbob6996> are you talking about exit?
[16:57] <soee> Kottizen, thank you
[17:11] <jimbob6996> and kubuntu 13.04 is available for DL too
[17:16] <Tm_T> jimbob6996: there's no Kubuntu 13.04 yet
[17:17] <riccardone> Tm_T : No, the official 13.04 will be released on April 2013
[17:17] <Tm_T> riccardone: indeed
[17:17] <jimbob6996> it's still in beta
[17:18] <jimbob6996> oops alpha  :))
[17:21] <riccardone> yeah, it's in alpha release
[17:23] <DarkSim> Kubuntu locked my mouse so I had to log out, smooth :/
[17:24] <kotTon_kaNdiy> raring ringtail
[17:24] <riccardone> instead my wireless mouse go wrong ...
[17:24] <Wizard> I don't even know the meaning of "raring" and "ringtail"
[17:24] <Wizard> :P
[17:24] <kotTon_kaNdiy> make sure the batteries are good
[17:25] <kotTon_kaNdiy> the new ubuntu code name
[17:26] <DarkSim> I think he meant the words as a definition
[17:26] <Wizard> I know it's the code name. I just don't understand the words :D
[17:26] <Wizard> Exactly.
[17:27] <kotTon_kaNdiy> ring tail is what they used to call raccoons :)
[17:27] <DarkSim> Can I edit the windows buttons and all that in KDE?
[17:27] <DarkSim> Because I don't like the default art style
[17:28] <Wizard> You can either try changing Oxygen options or switch theme to fit your needs.
[17:29] <DarkSim> in system settings?
[17:30] <Wizard> Yes.

[20:06] <DarthFrog> madconqueror:  If you want to follow Linux conventions, put it under /usr/local/vbvm.  That's your playground.
=== FtMan_ is now known as FtMan
[20:06] <DarthFrog>  /usr (USR = Unix System Resources) is for distro use. /usr/local is for sysadmin use.
[20:08] <DarthFrog> madconqueror:  /opt is OK, too, instead of /usr/local.  Use one or the other consistently, though.
[20:08] <sbivol> DarthFrog: I always thought /usr comes from „users” o_O
[20:08] <DarthFrog> sbivol:  Most people do, I imagine.

[20:18] <DarthFrog> madconqueror:  have you tweaked your system to use a SSD properly? http://apcmag.com/how-to-maximise-ssd-performance-with-linux.htm
[20:18] <DarthFrog> SSDs are fundamentally different from spinning rust.
[20:19] <madconqueror> how come?
[20:20] <DarthFrog> One has rotating platters with moving r/w heads, the other is addressable static memory.  One has virtually unlimited r/w cycles, the other has limited r/w cycles.  Treating a SSD drive like a regular HD can cause it to wear out prematurely and impinge performance.
[20:24] <madconqueror> OK, this is private usage. It's an i5-3210 on ivy that came with 2x2 GB RAM which I replaced with 2x4 GB RAM (1066 CL7...bla) and used it for surfing.
[20:25] <madconqueror> when i wanted to install x DB which demanded 4 GB of RAM I realized one DIMM had died.
[20:25] <madconqueror> now it has 1 8GB CL9
[20:26] <madconqueror> sufficiefect for the VM to provide 6 GB to the VM I want to live on my SSD
[20:26] <madconqueror> the x DB will only be used for traiining
[20:27] <madconqueror> would you rather install real world DBs on rust or on SSDs?
[20:29] <sbivol> I have this issue in KDE 4.9.98 – every notification appears too much to the right, half of it being beyond the visible area. When I try to drag it to its place, Plasma freezes.
[20:30] <DarthFrog> madconqueror:  I have my system and my home directory on a 240 GB SSD.  But I also have a 1 TB HD mounted under my home directory for storage.
[20:31] <kotTon_kaNdiy> backup drive, darth?
[20:31] <DarthFrog> madconqueror: For a database, where r/w access times are critical for performance, SSD's are ideal.
[20:31] <madconqueror> backups are not intended to be connected, kotTon_kaNdiy
[20:32] <DarthFrog> kotTon_kaNdiy: No.  Tunes, ebooks, download & work directories.  I have a 4 TB D-Link NAS for backup.
[20:32] <DarthFrog> Oh yeah, Steam and games are on the storage drive.
[20:32] <madconqueror> haha
[20:32] <madconqueror> thanks DarthFrog
[20:32] <DarthFrog> you're welcome.
[20:33] <kotTon_kaNdiy> my dad woulda been amazed how far drives and storage has progressed since he passed
[20:33] <sbivol> this screenshot shows a misplaced notification: http://cip.md/plasma-notification.png
[20:34] <DarthFrog> madconqueror:  Backups are intended to be used. :-)  Whatever arrangement someone makes that works for them is correct.  If used. :-)
[20:34] <kotTon_kaNdiy> he was used to the old 512 true floppies :))
[20:34] <kotTon_kaNdiy> yuppers
[20:35] <DarthFrog> kotTon_kaNdiy: I used 180 KB floppies and 300 baud acoustic coupler modems.
[20:35] <systemclient> How can I get Telepathy working with Voice and Video? #KDE told me that libtelepathy-qt4-farstream2 is missing, but apparently telepathy has to be build with that
[20:35] <kotTon_kaNdiy> at least I got rid of the oriiginal os on this computer vista :|
[20:35] <kotTon_kaNdiy> whata piece of crap that was
[20:35] <madconqueror> I used the 5.25'' myself, let's leave it at that.
