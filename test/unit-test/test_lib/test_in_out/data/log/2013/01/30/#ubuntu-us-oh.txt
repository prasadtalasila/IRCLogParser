[15:25] <thafreak> Morning Ohio
[15:26] <paultag> moin!
[15:26] <thafreak> sup tags
[15:27] <paultag> chilln'!
[15:27] <thafreak> Debating on whether to purchase the mpeg2 decode license for my pi
[15:27] <paultag> hows you doin?
[15:27] <thafreak> or just re-encode everything in mpeg4
[15:28] <thafreak> meh, I could be doing worse :)
[15:29] <paultag> :)
[15:29] <paultag> I'm trying to fuck with rdio's API
[15:29] <paultag> but it's just not working right
[15:29] <paultag> I need to get some sort of permissions
[15:29] <paultag> very wtfey
[15:40] <thafreak> interesting...
[15:41] <thafreak> I started working on a new system to better track my consulting hours and do better at billing
[15:41] <paultag> just emailed one of their devs
[15:41] <paultag> yeah?
[15:41] <thafreak> but it's morping...
[15:41] <paultag> oh god
[15:41] <thafreak> Might end up being the equivalent of an ERP
[15:41] <paultag> dude
[15:42] <thafreak> First I'm building the parts I need...
[15:42] <thafreak> might add on for one of my customers to use
[15:42] <thafreak> don't give me that dude look
[15:42] <paultag> dude
[15:42] <paultag> so much work
[15:42] <thafreak> besides erp's are where the $$ are at
[15:42] <paultag> haha
[15:43] <thafreak> everyone and their uncle has an erp, and consulting costs are sky high
[15:43] <thafreak> Initially, it's just going to be time tracking and invoicing for my own use
[15:44] <thafreak> but my wife needs some HR tools...so why not build those for her, and add it in
[15:44] <thafreak> Oh, and I don't like my trouble ticket system...why not add that on too
[15:44] <thafreak> and since I'm doing that, expand it a bit to have some CRM features ;)
[15:44] <thafreak> you see how this gets out of hand quickly
[15:48] <thafreak> My latest snippy response to recruiter
[15:48] <thafreak> http://pastebin.com/GhYm7D0H
[15:49] <paultag> oh lordy
[15:49] <thafreak> SEriously though, some one is hurting bad for a "linux engineer" in "cleveland"
[15:50] <thafreak> stupid ass recruiters won't ever tell you WHERE in cleveland though
[15:50] <thafreak> and I've litterally gotten a copy/paste of the job description, identical word for word, from I think I'm up to 3 different recruiting companies
[15:50] <paultag> hahahaha
[15:51] <thafreak> I could train my 5 year old to copy paste job descriptions and email them to everyone on linked in
[15:51] <thafreak> who has linux in their profile somewhere
[15:51] <thafreak> and they get paid what?
[21:12] <thafreak> Anyone have a good gwibber alternative?
[23:41] <skellat> No, not amused: http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=OHZ089&warncounty=OHC007&firewxzone=OHZ089&local_place1=Edgewood+OH&product1=Lake+Effect+Snow+Warning
