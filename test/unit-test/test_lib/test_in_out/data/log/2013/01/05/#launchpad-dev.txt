[00:29] <cjohnston> I'm guessing that adding X-Launchpad headers isn't quite as easy as http://paste.ubuntu.com/1497755/ is it?
[03:02] <cjohnston> uggh.. forgot it was a weekend.. :-/
[03:40] <cody-somerville> cjohnston: That would cause the test to start failing which is a first good step ;)
[03:40] <cjohnston> lol
[03:41] <cjohnston> I don't have a setup to be able to run tests :-/
[03:48] <lifeless> cjohnston: lxc ftw, you can make one easily :)
[03:49] <cjohnston> would be nice if lpsetup worked ;-)
[03:49] <cjohnston> (for something other than 12.04)
[03:50] <lifeless> cjohnston: There were manual instructions on the wiki last I looked ;)
[03:50] <lifeless> cjohnston: its only a few steps...

[16:56] <cjohnston> hrm... lifeless setting up rocket-fuel in lxc is having trouble importing keys :-/

[21:44] <cjohnston> When running rocket-fuel I'm getting "ERROR: Unable to create local copy of Rocketfuel trunk" after "Connection Timeout: disconnecting client after 300.0 seconds"... not sure what is going wrong. It seems to branch launchpad, then goes into something else. :-/
