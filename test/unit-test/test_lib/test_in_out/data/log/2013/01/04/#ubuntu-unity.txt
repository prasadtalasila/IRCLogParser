[01:33] <F^4> G'evening
[01:33] <F^4> Is anyone around by any chance? I can't get unity to play nice with the binary ATI drivers
[02:26] <smspillaz> F^4: what's wrong ?
[02:28] <F^4> smspillaz, The menu bar and dock are missing
[02:30] <smspillaz> F^4: can you click on them as though they were there ?
[02:30] <F^4> I didn't even try tbh. I just installed KDE and I've been using that.
[02:30] <F^4> Let me switch users and see.

[06:42] <didrocks> good morning
[06:42] <Mirv> good morning didrocks and welcome back!
[06:44] <didrocks> thanks Mirv! happy new year ;)
[06:46] <duflu> Mirv: Happy new year. Sorry to ruin it but I found:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1095001
[06:46] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1095001 in compiz (Ubuntu) "[regression] compiz spends 31% of its CPU time in regexec()" [High,Fix committed]
[06:47] <Mirv> indeed
[06:48] <Mirv> duflu: yeah, I noticed your branch
[06:48] <duflu> Just so you know :(
[06:48] <Mirv> the good news is that the previous SRU:s are all in, so we can do small ones
[06:48] <didrocks> Mirv: did you see that unity is FTBFS on the staging ppa (I did quite a lot during my holidays btw)?
[06:49] <Mirv> didrocks: not yet. I tried to stay away from Ubuntu during holidays but just had to eg. verify SRU:s etc :)
[06:50] <didrocks> Mirv: that's a good resolution! :) you are just back today? ;)
[06:50] <Mirv> didrocks: I did came back on Wednesday already
[06:50] <didrocks> ah ok :)
[06:52] <Mirv> it seems satoris' "Fix build settings" did the contrary
[06:53] <Mirv> how it got into staging should be the interesting part
[06:54] <didrocks> Mirv: yeah
[06:54] <didrocks> Mirv: can you ask mmrazik once he's around?
[06:54] <Mirv> sure
[06:55] <didrocks> Mirv: also, let's wait for Satoris and sil2100 once they are around to eventually revert their change
[06:56] <Mirv> yes
[06:56] <didrocks> Mirv: hum, no, it was already FTBFS for some days: https://launchpad.net/~unity-team/+archive/staging/+packages?field.name_filter=unity&field.status_filter=superseded&field.series_filter=raring
[06:56] <didrocks> rev 3002 on 2012-12-19
[06:57] <didrocks> that's the day I started to saw it as well, weird that nobody noticed :/
[06:59] <Mirv> but in staging rev 3008 built fine? https://launchpad.net/~unity-team/+archive/staging/+builds?build_text=unity&build_state=all
[07:01] <Mirv> and in daily two bzr3008:s, one of which built and the other use_pch enabled and failed
[07:01] <didrocks> Mirv: yeah, I'm looking at thatâ€¦ I don't understand why 2 builds by rev
[07:02] <didrocks> even more for 3002
[07:02] <Mirv> actually five for 3008 as well, I wonder if they are doing some by-hand use_pch testing
[07:02] <Mirv> maybe the situation is in control :)
[07:02] <didrocks> Mirv: uploader is ps-jenkins though
[07:03] <Mirv> we'll find out
[07:03] <didrocks> Mirv: please keep me posted :)
[07:03] <didrocks> thanks!
[07:03] <Mirv> yep
[09:57] <didrocks> Mirv: 2 things, thanks for the fw first :) (compiz was one of the first thing I checked before reading my emails TBH ;))
[09:57] <didrocks> Mirv: so, you are tracking with duflu the mesa 9 issue on precise with x-updates?
[09:59] <didrocks> Mirv: I'll ask the second right now, so you did check with mmrazik about the multiple uploads in the ppa with the same version? (like 5 uploads in the staging ppa)
[10:00] <mmrazik> didrocks: unity-team staging ppa/
[10:00] <mmrazik> ?
[10:00] <didrocks> mmrazik: yep
[10:01] <didrocks> mmrazik: look at https://launchpad.net/~unity-team/+archive/staging/+packages?field.name_filter=unity&field.status_filter=superseded&field.series_filter=raring
[10:01] <didrocks> mmrazik: you can see that there is multiple uploads (like 5) with the same bzr<revision>
[10:01] <didrocks> do you know about it?
[10:01] <mmrazik> didrocks: but the version is different, isn't it?
[10:02] <mmrazik> didrocks: its probably because something libunity depends on was uploaded
[10:02] <mmrazik> so a new dput was triggered to make sure libunity gets rebuild
[10:02] <mmrazik> (on a first glance; otherwise fginther will need to have a look)
[10:05] <didrocks> mmrazik: ah, and what the version in the end is about?
[10:05] <didrocks> seems pretty random, but there is maybe a logic :)
[10:05] <mmrazik> didrocks: the last number (after raring) is I believe a jenkins job # or something like that.
[10:05] <didrocks> ah ok
[10:05] <mmrazik> so its indeed kind of random but unique and monotomic
[10:05] <didrocks> makes sense, thanks :)
[10:10] <Mirv> didrocks: do you think it should be tracked, the mesa 9 (only)? so, not yet, since it's not what the .2 release is about
[10:10] <Mirv> duflu is of course aware of the issue, though
[10:11] <didrocks> Mirv: yeah, even if it won't realistically be in .2. It should be tracked I guess
[10:11] <Mirv> if we can confirm that the LTS-Q stack work, we can then try to narrow down why only mesa upgrade isn't enough
[10:11] <didrocks> yep :)
[10:11] <Mirv> ok, consider it being tracked
[10:11] <didrocks> thanks Mirv :)
[10:20] <didrocks> sil2100: hey! checking up now that I'm back from holidays: did you get any progress during the week you were there and I wasn't about the indicator autopilot tests?
[10:20] <didrocks> IIRC, we wanted the number to get down to 0 :)
[10:34] <didrocks> sil2100: sorry, didn't receive a reponse if any, system lock :/
[10:40] <davidcalle> didrocks, hey there, nice to see you back. Enjoyed your Christmas time?
[10:40] <sil2100> didrocks: ok, so - not completely sure what's the current number of failures is, since there has been no new unity daily package since a while ;p But locally I only had 4 failures, all of which were real regressions
[10:41] <didrocks> davidcalle: hey! yeah, was great, even if not as restful as expected (mindwise, hard to disconnect ;)). Yourself?
[10:41] <sil2100> From what I see the regression causing those 4 failures is not yet fixed though, since it's a low priority bug...
[10:42] <didrocks> sil2100: did you open a bug for them? Maybe we can bump the list
[10:42] <didrocks> them*
[10:42] <sil2100> didrocks: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1089482
[10:42] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1089482 in Unity "Unity HUD uses wrong icon when switching from the Dash to HUD" [Undecided,New]
[10:42] <sil2100> didrocks: I also had to re-visit the 'empty-menu-entries' issue with larsu, but after a while we finally sorted it out
[10:42] <davidcalle> didrocks, same for me ;)
[10:43] <sil2100> Since in one moment I thought it was not fixed again, but then in the end it was fixed, but gedit was simply broken ;p
[10:44] <sil2100> So even with larsu's fix, I had to hack-up the autopilot test to work properly with applications like gedit, which add seperators to the main menu bar (huh)
[10:44] <didrocks> sil2100: the 4 failures are because of that?
[10:44] <didrocks> sil2100: oh ok ;)
[10:44] <sil2100> No, the 4 failures are because of #1089482
[10:44] <sil2100> :)
[10:44] <didrocks> sil2100: I think it's worth fixing it then, right?
[10:45] <sil2100> I think so - some days before the holidays I pinged Trevinho about this bug, but I think he was busy with other things
[10:45] <sil2100> I could also ultimately look into it myself
[10:45] <didrocks> sil2100: oh, that would be cool! and then, from your side, it's the only one that needs to be fixed and then, we live in a wonderful world, isn't it? ;)
[10:46] <sil2100> didrocks: let's hope so! The next daily unity package will reveal if all is as wonderful as my test-box says ;p
[10:46] <didrocks> sil2100: heh, indeed :)
[10:47] <didrocks> sil2100: let's wait for unity to have the merge we are waiting on and then, I'll try a build in a ppa
[10:47] <didrocks> sil2100: and then again, we can run the tests :)
[10:47] <didrocks> (with the ppa content)
[10:49] <sil2100> Would be good, since I even added some additional safety waits to some of the risky Autopilot tests, since some failures were due to e.g. a window not opening fast enough
[10:49] <didrocks> excellent! :)
[10:49] <didrocks> thanks again for working on that, it's a hard work that was needed :)
[10:51]  * sil2100 just noticed one old MR not merged in due to some jenkins failure
[10:52] <sil2100> I wonder if it'll still be mergable
[10:53] <didrocks> try it! :-)
[11:35] <didrocks> hey andyrock, how are you?
[11:35] <andyrock> didrocks, not bad you?
[11:35] <didrocks> I'm good thanks!
[11:35] <didrocks> andyrock: looking at https://code.launchpad.net/~3v1n0/unity/remove-bamf-indicators/+merge/140519
[11:35] <didrocks> andyrock: so unity won't build/work with older bamf?
[11:36] <didrocks> or is it the contrary rather?
[11:36] <didrocks> those functions are not used at all in the current code, isn't it?
[11:36] <andyrock> in the current code they are not used
[11:36] <andyrock> in 6.0 trunk yes
[11:36] <didrocks> excellent, just wanted to confirm! Thanks andyrock :)
[11:37] <andyrock> so current code will not work with older bamf
[11:37] <didrocks> so
[11:37] <didrocks> we need to bump the build-dep in debian/control, right?
[11:37] <andyrock> and old unity will not work with new bamf ;)
[11:37] <didrocks> to ensure we build with newer bamf?
[11:37] <andyrock> didrocks, yup i think there was a discussion about that between Trevinho and mterry
[11:38] <didrocks> I don't see the build-dep bump MR though?
[11:39] <andyrock> didrocks, weird, do you want me do it?
[11:39] <didrocks> and Trevinho isn't around or my ping went into void :)
[11:39] <didrocks> well, let's wait for Trevinho maybe
[11:39] <andyrock> Trevinho usually start to work in the afternoon
[11:39] <andyrock> *starts
[11:39] <didrocks> ok, let's see, this can wait now :)
[11:39] <didrocks> thanks andyrock :)
[11:39] <andyrock> ok let me know
[11:39] <andyrock> np
[11:41] <didrocks> andyrock: oh, while you are around: https://code.launchpad.net/~andyrock/unity/update-dash-string/+merge/139897
[11:41] <didrocks> andyrock: you are not testing the gsettings key if remote search is disabled
[11:43] <andyrock> didrocks, you are right. I'll ask John
[11:44] <didrocks> andyrock: thanks! :)
[11:48] <mhr3> i dont think it's desired to check the key, it's a hint, scopes can ignore it
[11:49] <mhr3> and btw hello didrocks, good holidays? :)
[11:49] <didrocks> mhr3: yeah, but as told previously, not really succeeded in disconnecting mentally from work. Yourself? :)
[11:50] <mhr3> it's a fairy tale that it's possible to disconnect mentally :P
[11:50] <didrocks> heh ;)
[11:50] <mhr3> but yea, enjoyed time family and friends... got some rest, killed some aliens... good times :)
[11:52] <sil2100> Aliens?!
[11:52] <didrocks> I rather avoid the world to collapse down replaying broken sword 1 to 4 ;)
[12:14] <alo21> mhr3, hi.... Can I ask you a thing about unity-lens-video, please?
[12:46] <mhr3> alo21, sure
[13:31] <alo21> mhr3, did you used zeitgeist to use a signle instance when someone click on a film to see it?
[13:33] <alo21> use*
[13:45] <mhr3> alo21, what do you mean single instance?
[13:59] <alo21> mhr3, if I open a new film from the dash, and leave totem opens, and then open a new film (from the dash), I can see the film from totem, which was open
[14:01] <mhr3> you mean instead of opening a new totem window?
[14:01] <mhr3> zg has nothing to do with that, totem is implemented that way (using GtkApplication)
[14:03] <alo21> mhr3, oh... OK... thank you for your time

[14:19] <mterry> didrocks, heyo!  sorry for not noticing the PPA failures myself
[14:20] <didrocks> mterry: hey! :) No worry, I think I didn't tell you to monitor it and it's transiant until we have the daily build ppa
[14:20] <didrocks> so now until we have it, I think you will look at it :)
[14:20] <didrocks> mterry: how were your holidays btw?
=== davidcalle_ is now known as davidcalle
[14:21] <mterry> didrocks, good
[14:21] <mterry> didrocks, wait, how is the daily build ppa different than the staging ppa?
[14:21] <didrocks> mterry: btw, I have some small questions if you have time right now
[14:21] <mterry> didrocks, shoot
[14:21] <didrocks> https://code.launchpad.net/~3v1n0/unity/remove-bamf-indicators/+merge/140519 <- andyrock told me you spoke about it with Trevinho
[14:22] <didrocks> it doesn't need to force the build-dep on latest bamf, right?
[14:23] <fginther> didrocks, mmrazik, so here's some background on the unity staging uploads. We noticed that satoris's PCH commit was causing an FTBFS in launchpad, so I hacked the source upload to disable pch builds to keep the ppa building while satoris debugged the issue...
[14:24] <didrocks> fginther: I would prefer in that case that we don't go into this road :/
[14:24] <didrocks> fginther: rather reverting the branch
[14:24] <didrocks> and have that in a separate one
[14:24] <didrocks> fortunately, I disable daily-build during the holidays
[14:24] <fginther> autolanding on the pch commit passed through jenkins because it does a coverage build which somehow avoids the build failure
[14:25] <didrocks> also this kind of hack on a merger side will create a backlog
[14:25] <didrocks> fginther: it was still failing on launchpad though?
[14:25] <didrocks> see  https://launchpad.net/~unity-team/+archive/staging/+packages?field.name_filter=unity&field.status_filter=superseded&field.series_filter=raring
=== dandrader|afk is now known as dandrader
[14:26] <didrocks> every revision failed (even if there are multiple uploads per revision)
[14:26] <fginther> didrocks, correct. launchpad builds continued to fail for future autolands. The rebuild job was disabling use_pch
[14:27] <fginther> (all of the *raring0 uploads are from an autolanding job, the others are from a rebuild due to a changed dependency or manually intervention)
[14:28] <fginther> didrocks, I'll be more cautious in the future and request these commits be reverted when there are launchpad build failures
[14:29] <didrocks> fginther: thanks :)
[14:29] <didrocks> mterry: forgotten me? :)
[14:30] <mterry> didrocks, oh goodness
[14:30] <mterry> didrocks, you didn't highlight me!  :)
[14:30] <didrocks> didn't I?
[14:30] <didrocks> ah yeah :)
[14:30] <didrocks> it was 10 seconds after last sentence! :)
[14:30] <didrocks> come on ;-)
[14:31] <mterry> didrocks, right, doesn't need to bump build dep, since it is merely not using old functionality, rather than using new functionality
[14:32] <mterry> didrocks, ain't no one got time to hang around 10s
[14:34] <didrocks> :)
[14:34] <didrocks> mterry: I think you forgot to rereview https://code.launchpad.net/~3v1n0/bamf/gir-package/+merge/140742 btw
[14:34] <mterry> didrocks, oh ah
[14:34] <didrocks> mterry: also, FYI, sil2100 is working on fixing https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1089482 which will fix the latest tests blocking daily landing
[14:34] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1089482 in Unity "Unity HUD uses wrong icon when switching from the Dash to HUD" [Undecided,New]
[14:35] <didrocks> and that's it from me for you :)
[14:35] <mterry> didrocks, I talked on IRC about that.  We wanted some guidance on gir package naming.  Do you know the policy on that?
[14:35] <sil2100> That's right! (once I finish lunch)
[14:35] <didrocks> mterry: the debian one? I think it's an email
[14:35] <didrocks> one sec
[14:36] <didrocks> sil2100: lunch? this is sooooo 2012
[14:36] <didrocks> sil2100: with the mobile target, no more lunch!
[14:37] <mterry> I couldn't find the email.  I think it's in their bug tracker somewhere...
[14:37] <didrocks> mterry: http://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2009/09/msg00011.html
[14:39] <sil2100> :'(
[14:39] <sil2100> ;)
[14:39] <mterry> didrocks, hrm, OK.  That explains how to name the package based on what upstream gives.  But I guess I really wanted some guidance on what upstream should do.  But clearly the gir typelib does *not* include SONAME (though seems to me like it should?)
[14:41] <didrocks> mterry: yeah, the typelib should have it IMHO
[14:44] <mterry> didrocks, that's what's bugging me.  These versions they use for the typelib don't make sense.  They have Webkit-1.0.typelib, when they should have Webkit-1.0-0.typelib.  :(  Ah well, guess I can't fight convention here
[14:45] <didrocks> mterry: I agree, for me, it should just be the SONAME, it's what is of interest, with a path containing the gir version
[15:56] <mterry> didrocks, btw, you intimated that the staging ppa and the daily build ppa are different?
[15:56] <didrocks> mterry: yeah, the staging is per commit, the daily build is per day
[15:56] <didrocks> mterry: and we are going to kill the per commit once we have the daily landing on
[15:56] <mterry> ah
[16:15] <mterry> didrocks, why do we still build unity-2d?
[16:15] <didrocks> mterry: on precise for SRUs, did you see anything else?
[16:16] <mterry> didrocks, the staging does for quantal
[16:16] <mterry> didrocks, or maybe it's just cruft from when we did build it
[16:16] <didrocks> mterry: still? or was it at the beginning of quantal? we didn't remove unity-2d right away, so we can have some versions
[16:17] <mterry> didrocks, OK, deleted the quantal version from the PPA
[16:17] <didrocks> thanks :)

[21:31] <toabctl> I have a problem with unity/lightdm. When I try to run unity from lightdm, I always return to lightdm. I only can run unity with "sudo stop lightdm && startx && unity".
[21:32] <toabctl> all works fine with the guest session or a new user account.
[21:32] <toabctl> maybe I have to remove/reset some (dconf) settings?
