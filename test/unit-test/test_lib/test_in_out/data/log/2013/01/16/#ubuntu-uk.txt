[00:08] <ali1234> can anyone remember how you install amiga workbench on a new hard drive??
[00:09] <ali1234> it just occured to me that the reason i can't remember is because i only ever had to do it once
[00:09] <ali1234> "progress"
[00:10] <popey> you have an amiga? or you're emulating?
[00:12] <ali1234> popey: i just "fixed" my A4000
[00:13] <ali1234> actually the problem was the VGA adapter
[00:14] <shauno> if you have a proper distribution of wordpress, one of the disks should simply be labelled install.  it'll contain an app on it called HD Install
[00:14] <ali1234> ah yes, the install disk
[00:14] <shauno> "contain an app on it" .. I swear I speak english natively.
[00:15] <ali1234> you also wrote "wordpress"
[00:15] <shauno> good point.  okay, it's time for bed.
[00:15] <exobuzz> there is an "install" disk as part of the amigaos disk set
[00:15] <exobuzz> you are aware of the old 3.1 hd prep limitations and recommendations to use a newer tool to do any partitioning etc. also filesystem/scsi.device limits etc ?
[00:15] <exobuzz> also: pfs is freely available now which you might want to use if you want to use partitions >4gb etc
[00:15] <exobuzz> ouch
[00:15] <exobuzz> oh. sorry i thought you meant i wrote wordpress. hehe.
[00:15] <ali1234> pfs?
[00:16] <exobuzz> http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/pfs3aio
[00:16] <ali1234> i think i have lag
[00:16] <exobuzz> if you want to use partitions over 2gb or 4gb or something you need sfs or pfs3
[00:16] <exobuzz> you probably know all this
[00:16] <ali1234> i put a 1GB HD in it
[00:16] <ali1234> i used to knw it but i forgot
[00:16] <exobuzz> you still might want to use pfs3 or something though due to it being better than ffs in many ways
[00:17] <shauno> where on earth did you get a 1GB hdd?  (and cf-ide ftw)
[00:17] <ali1234> i got it out of my box o'crap
[00:17] <exobuzz> i still use a hd in my a1200, since I have so many old laptop drives lying around. 30gb or so it hink
[00:17] <ali1234> i have a 42MB one in the box
[00:17] <exobuzz> also have CF slot in the side
[00:17] <ali1234> and yeah i want to put a CF-IDE in it
[00:18] <ali1234> but i couldn't find it
[00:18] <exobuzz> inside my a1200 http://malus.exotica.org.uk/~buzz/a1200/IMG_4291.JPG
[00:18] <ali1234> mainly what i want to do is get ppp over serial with amitcp (or whatever networking stack is used these days) and then image all my old disks
[00:18] <shauno> yeah, I have a laptop hdd in my 1200 (and pcmcia-cf in the side for EasyADF)
[00:18] <exobuzz> (new hd since then though)
[00:19] <exobuzz> ali1234, slip works well. you can use magplip for additional speed over parallel but more complex to setup and custom cable etc
[00:19] <exobuzz> ppp over serial is doable. but slip is simpler maybe
[00:19] <exobuzz> i use my pcmcia for ethernet card currently
[00:19] <ali1234> i used to use parnet and a A500/A570 to read CD-ROMs on my A1200
[00:20] <ali1234> lol
[00:20] <ali1234> ppp is going to be easier on linux side
[00:20] <shauno> http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6156/6175483156_43d83bff4d_b.jpg   that's mine.  nothing too amazing.  indivision scandoubler and I think an 040 in the bottom, I can't remember now :/
[00:20] <ali1234> don't wanna do parallel cables again :/
[00:20] <exobuzz> shauno, nice! :) indivision eh? you must be wealthy !
[00:21] <shauno> more foolish :)
[00:21] <ali1234> i have a 030 card in my A1200. i can't remember which one
[00:21] <ali1234> it's actually faster than this 4000
[00:21] <exobuzz> since we are talking amigas, I feel the need to spam my amiga site http://www.exotica.org.uk/
[00:21] <exobuzz> :)
[00:21] <shauno> (I don't regret it, but I'm not sure I'd do it again either)
[00:21] <ali1234> and it has a MMU
[00:22] <ali1234> why a scan doubler?
[00:22] <shauno> so it'll work on a regular vga monitor
[00:22] <exobuzz> for great picture on modern monitors and also you get extra stuff like new screenmodes
[00:22] <ali1234> modern monitors support 576i :)
[00:22] <ali1234> mine does
[00:23] <ali1234> D U2410
[00:23] <ali1234> *Dell
[00:23] <exobuzz> alternatively you can play the "buy an lcd tv/lcd and hope for the best".
[00:23] <shauno> I can do 1024x768 at a relatively sensible refresh rate
[00:23] <ali1234> nah, just by a good monitor
[00:23] <exobuzz> my lcd tv doesnt take 15khz over the vga, but can do via scart, but not a great picture really
[00:23] <exobuzz> U2410 isnt perfect
[00:23] <exobuzz> try interlace modes etc
[00:24] <ali1234> you'll never get a good picture out of a LCD anyway
[00:24] <ali1234> and... yeah this monitor does interlace
[00:24] <exobuzz> my NEC4PG had a nice picture, but it needs recapping etc. its knackered. and not worth the repair costs
[00:24] <shauno> I don't have LCD for it, I have some anchorweight Dell that's so old it's beige (but didn't cost me a penny)
[00:24] <ali1234> it even has composite input
[00:25] <ali1234> someone here recommended it to me
[00:25] <ali1234> i can't remember who it was, but well done anyway
[00:27] <exobuzz> its still easier with a scan doubler. most monitors dont take 15khz on vga etc. and many that do don't work that well with some modes. im pretty sure there will be limitation on the U2410, but it does seem to be pretty good from some pics ive just seen. can you adjust overscan etc for example ?
[00:28] <ali1234> yes
[00:28] <exobuzz> and control the aspect ratio ?
[00:28] <ali1234> yes
[00:28] <exobuzz> nice
[00:29] <ali1234> you get zoom/horizontal position/vertical position
[00:29] <ali1234> and fill/aspect/1:1
[00:29] <ali1234> whatever those mean
[00:30] <ali1234> also there is a setting "pixel clock" but i have no idea at all what that does
[00:31] <ali1234> it also has PIP/PBP mode so i can see PC and amiga display at the same time :)
[00:31] <exobuzz> its to do with the division of the horizontal signal into pixels or something
[00:32] <exobuzz> ideally id like a 4:3 screen. i use a 4:3 lcd monitor on my a4k on the cybervision. but a4k is pieces atm (need to send it off to be recapped)
[00:33] <exobuzz> might look into second hand prices of that dell monitor then if its as good as you make it sound heh
[00:33] <exobuzz> ta

[00:37] <popey> ☺
[00:42] <ali1234> so the problem was the VGA adapter that i used to use with a special CRT wide syncing monitor (which is now dead)
[00:42] <ali1234> it was just wires inside
[00:42] <ali1234> it's supposed to have a buffer, and apparently the A4000 thinks this monitor is a genlock or something
[00:42] <ali1234> so i had to solder a chip inside
[00:57] <dwatkins> I just ordered red function keys for my IBM Model M so it looks like an A3020
[00:57] <dwatkins> ah, that's an Amiga, not an Archimedes, though...
[01:58] <david__> hey guys can anyone help? I uninstalled wine 1.4 by       sudo apt-get purge wine 1.4          and now ubuntu software center got erased, cannot use synaptic and commands apt-get cannot be found, zypper cannot be found, yum cannot be found.. what can I do ?
[01:58] <david__> any1 ?
[01:59] <popey> oops
[01:59] <Azelphur> uhh, yum should never be found on Ubuntu, it's not a RPM distro.
[01:59] <Azelphur> what version of Ubuntu are you on?
[01:59] <popey> you're in a pickle if apt-get has been removed
[02:00] <Azelphur> hehe
[02:00] <Azelphur> popey: I did one better, earlier I had a machine where bash had been removed.
[02:01] <david__> ubuntu 12.10
[02:01] <david__> all that happend by removing wine 1.4
[02:01] <Azelphur> david__: do you have apt-get installed still?
[02:02] <david__> I don't think so
[02:02] <david__> cannot use any aptitude commands
[02:02] <Azelphur> check by trying to run it
[02:02] <popey> what happens if you just type "ap-tget"
[02:02] <popey> er
[02:02] <popey> apt-get
[02:02] <Azelphur> Ubuntu hasn't shipped with aptitude for a while now ;)
[02:02] <david__> apt-get: command not found
[02:02] <Azelphur> yup, it's broke.
[02:02] <popey> you're somewhat knackered
[02:03] <david__> the problem is that
[02:03] <david__> if I could use zypper or yun
[02:03] <david__> yum*
[02:03] <david__> I would reinstall it
[02:03] <david__> but I cannot even use those
[02:03] <david__> gives same error
[02:03] <david__> cannot be found
[02:03] <Azelphur> you certainly don't want to try and install yum on a debian based distro, that's asking for trouble.
[02:03] <popey> those are not commands you should run on ubuntu
[02:04] <popey> you could possibly wget the deb and install it manually with dpkg
[02:04] <Azelphur> ah yea that's a good idea
[02:04] <popey> david__: is it 32-bit or 64-bit install
[02:04] <popey> ?
[02:04] <david__> 64-bit
[02:04] <popey> wget http://ubuntu.mirror.cambrium.nl/ubuntu//pool/main/a/apt/apt_0.9.7.5ubuntu5.2_amd64.deb
[02:05] <popey> and once downloaded do:-
[02:05] <popey> sudo dpkg -i apt_0.9.7.5ubuntu5.2_amd64.deb
[02:05] <david__> first part worked
[02:05] <david__> dpkg: error: dpkg status database is locked by another process
[02:05] <david__> on second part
[02:05] <popey> do you have another apt or dpkg open somewhere?
[02:06] <david__> nope
[02:06] <popey> something is open somewhere
[02:06] <popey> or a stale lock
[02:06] <david__> I'm quite new, cannot tell for sure but I'm pretty much sure I didn't open anything by myself atleat :D
[02:06] <popey> ps aux | grep dpkg
[02:07] <popey> will show any dpkg processes still running
[02:07] <popey> ps aux | grep apt
[02:07] <popey> etc
[02:07] <david__> david     3838  0.0  0.0  13580   936 pts/1    S+   04:07   0:00 grep --color=auto dpkg
[02:07] <popey> so probably a stale lock
[02:08] <david__> and how I unlock it ? :P
[02:09] <popey> is there a file /var/lib/dpkg/lock  ?
[02:09] <popey> ls -l /var/lib/dpkg/lock
[02:09] <david__> -rw-r----- 1 root root 0 Jan 16 04:05 /var/lib/dpkg/lock
[02:09] <popey> ok, lets bin that
[02:10] <popey> sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
[02:10] <popey> then do sudo dpkg -i apt_0.9.7.5ubuntu5.2_amd64.deb
[02:10] <popey> hows it going?
[02:10] <david__> done
[02:11] <popey> ok, lets try to fix it...
[02:11] <popey> sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^
[02:11] <popey> and note the ^ on the end is important
[02:11] <popey> this should download and install everything that was accidentally removed
[02:11] <david__> erm
[02:11] <david__> it did it
[02:11] <david__> but
[02:11] <david__> it means
[02:11] <david__> apt-get is working now
[02:11] <david__> ?
[02:11] <popey> well, lets see if this works first
[02:11] <david__> because before anything related to apt-get would tell me its not a command
[02:12] <popey> yes, we just manually re-installed it ☺
[02:12] <david__> E: Unable to locate package ubuntu-desktop^ E: Couldn't find task 'ubuntu-desktop' E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'ubuntu-desktop^'
[02:12] <popey> sudo apt-get update
[02:12] <popey> do that
[02:13] <popey> and if you get lots of output, pastebin it
[02:13] <popey> http://paste.ubuntu.com/
[02:13] <david__> yeah it gives lot of stuff
[02:13] <david__> will copy once its done
[02:14] <david__> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1536231/
[02:15] <popey> ok, now do the sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^
[02:16] <david__> 0 upgraded, 18 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded. E: Could not get lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) E: Unable to lock directory /var/cache/apt/archives/

[02:18] <david__> -rw-r----- 1 root root 0 Jan 16 03:29 /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
[02:19] <popey> ok
[02:19] <popey> sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
[02:19] <popey> then run the apt-get again
[02:20] <david__> still processing
[02:22] <david__> done
[02:22] <david__> no error
[02:22] <popey> what did it do?
[02:22] <popey> pastebin?
[02:22] <david__> sec

[02:23] <david__> last lines
[02:23] <popey> looks fixed to me
[02:23] <david__> how do I get rid of synaptic now
[02:24] <david__> and install back ubuntu software centre
[02:24] <david__> ?
[02:24] <popey> it added software centre back in
[02:25] <david__> ah ye
[02:25] <david__> and now sudo apt-get purge synaptic manager?
[02:25] <popey> sudo apt-get remove synaptic
[02:26] <david__> okay, thanks alot mate
[02:26] <david__> I was searching stuff on net for 2 days
[02:26] <david__> could not get it fix
[02:26] <david__> appretiate it
[02:26] <popey> no problem
[02:26] <popey> have fun
[02:29] <Azelphur> someone needs to make an easy way to have your entire OS pulled into RAM and lazy write to disk :(
[02:43] <david__> any Ideas how to install dota 2 or league of legends on linux ? :P
[02:46] <david__> popey when I try to save something this is what happens : The folder contents could not be displayed. Error when getting information for file '/home/david/Documents/fixes/Fix apt-get ': No such file or directory
[02:49] <david__> can anyone help?
[02:50] <david__> cannot save anything. was trying to save text document and it gave this error
[06:03] <popey> morning slackers
[06:04] <daftykins> o/
[06:04] <daftykins> morning captain funny
[06:04] <popey> uhoh
[08:05] <knightwise> morning everyone
[08:06] <MartijnVdS> howdy knightwise
[08:08] <knightwise> hey martijn , how are you today
[08:09] <MartijnVdS> cold :)
[08:09] <MartijnVdS> well, not now I'm inside
[08:09] <MartijnVdS> but *shudder* @ outside
[08:09] <knightwise> same here , just pludged through the snow in the direction of eindhoven
[08:10] <MartijnVdS> eek, it's -15ish there
[08:11] <knightwise> About minus ten on the road
[08:11] <knightwise> damn.
[08:11] <knightwise> i decided to be curagious today and bring my netbookt o work
[08:11] <knightwise> running ica client on it.
[08:11] <knightwise> not a big success so far
[08:11] <knightwise> ica client works
[08:11] <knightwise> but now my external screen is stuck at a resolution of 800x600
[08:12] <MartijnVdS> how 90s ;)
[08:12] <knightwise> great for CLI stuff , shit for windwos stuff
[08:12] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: "Treinverkeer Brabant ontregeld door winterweer: storingen Breda, Tilburg en Den Bosch"
[08:12]  * knightwise is by car
[08:12] <knightwise> i live near Maastricht
[08:13] <knightwise> cant believe this no longer words properly in ubuntu
[08:14] <knightwise> I hook up a simple 19 inch display via the VGA connector and it cant figure out the resolution ?
[08:14] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: which graphics chipset does the netbook have?
[08:14] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: if it's "nvidia", blame them.
[08:16] <knightwise> I'll check
[08:17] <knightwise> its an old Medion netbook. :)
[08:17] <knightwise> Intel® 945GME x86/MMX/SSE2
[08:17] <daftykins> ooh-err
[08:17] <knightwise> Wanted to do an article on how you can still use old netbooks as portable thin clients and stuff.
[08:18] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: what does xrandr --auto do?
[08:18] <MartijnVdS> or first:
[08:18] <MartijnVdS> just "urandr"
[08:18] <knightwise> command not found
[08:23] <knightwise> damn
[08:23] <knightwise> system locked up
[08:24] <knightwise> urandr  ? it nows arandr and xrandr
[08:24] <BigRedS> knightwise: The trick is, generally, to not assume you know how to do it and, instead, find out the new Ubuntu way of doing it
[08:24] <BigRedS> not sure if that's exactly what's happened here, but it's the sort of thing that keeps tripping me up
[08:26] <knightwise> BigRedS: but the "new ubuntu way" offfers me no other resolution then 800x600 in the display setting
[08:26] <knightwise> MartijnVdS: what is xrandr --auto exactly ?
[08:30] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: it autodetects screens and sets optimum resolution
[08:30] <MartijnVdS>        --auto For connected but disabled outputs, this will enable them  using
[08:30] <MartijnVdS>               their  preferred mode (or, something close to 96dpi if they have
[08:30] <MartijnVdS>               no preferred mode). For disconnected but enabled  outputs,  this
[08:30] <MartijnVdS>               will disable them.
[08:31] <MartijnVdS> </spam>
[08:31] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: it used to help to boot with the screen already attached.. some old Intel cards needed that.
[08:36] <knightwise> i'm doing that. still no love :(
[08:36] <knightwise> i'll try xrandr in a minute
[08:37] <daftykins> at least it's not an i845
[08:37] <daftykins> that doesn't even boot under 10.04 without a kernel param :>
[08:39] <knightwise> xrandr --auto .. right ?
[08:39] <MartijnVdS> yes
[08:39] <MartijnVdS> just without the --auto firsat
[08:39] <MartijnVdS> to show what it's detected
[08:39] <MartijnVdS> You can also use xrandr to add modes/resolutions
[08:40] <knightwise> http://pastebin.com/kbzdBxTs
[08:41] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: can you pastebin _all_ the output? :) Not just the one connector?
[08:44] <knightwise> http://pastebin.com/S44e4FwS
[08:45] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --output LVDS1 --mode 1024x768
[08:45] <MartijnVdS> ah wait!
[08:45] <MartijnVdS> it's because the panel is 1024x600
[08:45] <MartijnVdS> *facepalm*
[08:45] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: if you disable the internal panel, everything will be fine.
[08:45] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024 --output LVDS1 --disable
[08:46] <MartijnVdS> uhr
[08:46] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024 --output LVDS1 --off
[08:51]  * knightwise KISSIS MartijnVdS !
[08:53] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: you happy now? :)
[08:54] <knightwise> Overjoyed !
[08:55] <knightwise> so if i make a script out of it
[08:55] <knightwise> /bin/bash
[08:55] <knightwise> and then the command
[08:55] <knightwise> i can use that right ?
[08:56] <MartijnVdS> sure
[08:57] <MartijnVdS> but it should also be possible to set this from the default tool
[08:57] <MartijnVdS> the "Screen & display" (monitors?) tool
[08:57] <MartijnVdS> just enable the second screen, then _disable_ the panel.. after that you should be able to select higher resolutions for the external screen
[08:57] <MartijnVdS> it's a multi-stage thing
[09:12] <daftykins> was he not able to run both displays at once at full res then?
=== davidmarais_ is now known as davidmarais
[09:24] <MartijnVdS> daftykins: no, some of those intel chips can't do that
[09:40] <knightwise> Hmm.. I am noticing unity can be a little laggy on my atom netbook with one gig of ram
[09:40] <knightwise> might just boot into xubuntu instead
[09:40] <MartijnVdS> blamepopey.com
[09:45] <brobostigon> good morning everyone.
[09:45] <MartijnVdS> \o brobostigon

[09:54] <rmarcandier> good morning
[09:54] <brobostigon> good morning rmarcandier
[10:34] <knightwise> There :)Alpine all set up :p
[10:37] <BigRedS> I'm running 13.04 with an encrypted ~. How likely is it to not be an arse to install 12.04 preserving /home and have things working afterwards?
[10:37] <BigRedS> it's all in one volume
[10:39] <czajkowski> Laney: xnox ^^^^
[10:41] <xnox> BigRedS: so you want to downgrade 2 releases? sounds like a pain - backup your home & list of packages installed, install 12.04, reinstall packages, bring your home back, fix any settings missmatches.
[10:41] <xnox> there were a lot of changes since 12.04 =/
[10:42] <BigRedS> er, nah, 12.10 would be okay
[10:42] <BigRedS> forgot that was out
[10:42] <BigRedS> just want to not be on a prerelease
[10:42] <xnox> why do you want to downgrade? maybe we can just fix something for you in 13.04? =)
[10:42] <Laney> It's "can the installer reuse an encrypted home"?
[10:42] <xnox> Laney: let's just say that installer can wipe your home sometimes when it's "reusing" the installation.
[10:42] <BigRedS> basically, virt-manager and/or n-m keep having spats and I'm getting really bored of trying to work out why my VMs cant talk to my host any more
[10:43] <BigRedS> but I don't have anything with me on which to back up my /home, but would sort of like to get some work done before I next do
[10:43] <xnox> BigRedS: switching back to 12.10 sounds like a big hammer which might not firx your virt-manager networking problem.
[10:43] <xnox> it's working fine there for me.
[10:43] <BigRedS> no, but I'd at least feel better when I rant about it :)
[10:44] <BigRedS> TBH, Wheezy's looking really likely come Monday now
[10:44] <xnox> wheezy will be delayed as hell. we are looking at ~ april.
[10:44] <MartijnVdS> xnox: why?
[10:45] <BigRedS> er, are there any reasonable docs on virt-manager? Basically, if I can easily have it redo its networking when n-m buggers it up that'd be a better workaround than the current one
[10:45] <BigRedS> which is to reboot
[10:46] <BigRedS> and run a script which tries to configure n-m to not try to manage virt-manager's bridge. Which seems to have something like 50% effectiveness
[10:46] <BigRedS> Though nothing appears to have gone wrong on this boot, though at first glance no VM can find a dhcp server
[10:47] <BigRedS> Basically, I'd rather be in a position where I can reasonably expect everything to work, but just to be somewhere where it does would do for now :)
[10:47] <xnox> MartijnVdS: look how far wheezy is behind http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2013/01/11-Debian_Release_Critical_Bug_report_for_Week_02/
[10:47] <xnox> BigRedS: try to catch folks on #ubuntu-server
[10:48] <xnox> BigRedS: in particular stgraber =)
[10:48]  * xnox is not sure why stgraber idles in #ubuntu-uk =))))
[10:49] <BigRedS> xnox: cool, ta!
[10:56] <czajkowski> xnox: all the cool people idle in here :)
[10:57] <xnox> czajkowski: I guess I should leave then....
[10:58] <davmor2> Morning all
[11:11] <MartijnVdS> whoa.. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-21040410
[11:13] <jpds> MartijnVdS: http://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/505369-helicopter-crash-central-london.html
[11:13] <MartijnVdS> jpds: rumours?!
[11:14] <jpds> MartijnVdS: Actually open the link.
[11:14] <MartijnVdS> ah lots of infos
[11:25] <andrei_> hello guys
[11:25] <MartijnVdS> hi andrei_
[11:25] <andrei_> i was wondering how do I sync the data between two glusterfs servers that are set in replicated mode
[11:26] <andrei_> i've got a file on one server that is different from the second file server
[11:26] <andrei_> and I can't seems to get it in sync
[11:26] <andrei_> i tried the heal option
[11:26] <andrei_> but that didn't work
[11:28] <andrei_> as a result, two of my glusterfs clients see the same file with different sizes
[11:28] <andrei_> even worse, accessing this file gives me md5sum: /mnt/glusterfs/date: Input/output error
[11:29] <MartijnVdS> I don't think there are many glusterfs-knowing people in here..
[14:37] <ali1234> can anyone help me ID these simms? http://al.robotfuzz.com/~al/random/simm1-1.jpg
[14:38] <dwatkins> ali1234: they look lke they might fit in an SGI Indy, if that helps.
[14:38] <ali1234> lolno
[14:39] <ali1234> i know what they are for
[14:39] <ali1234> i want to know the sizes :)
[14:39] <dwatkins> ah ok, no markings to help, I assume
[14:39] <ali1234> a couple of them are marked
[14:39] <ali1234> trouble is if i put them in the machine it will just read 4mb because it can't handle larger
[14:40] <dwatkins> Kingston apparently still have their 'lifetime warranty' thing they're obliged to honour, so if you call them with a failed DIMIM/SIMM, in theory they have to replace it.
[14:40] <ali1234> cool
[14:40] <ali1234> i think one of the kingstons is duff actually so that should be an amusing phone call
[14:40] <dwatkins> as you can imagine, they don't publicise it much
[14:41] <ali1234> these simms are all 20 years old :)
[14:41] <dwatkins> yeah, I used to work with someone who worked there, they apparently had to replace them despite their age
[14:41] <dwatkins> I'd be amused to hear the result
[14:41] <directhex> 72 pin.
[14:42] <directhex> probably EDO
[14:44] <shauno> the kingston ones don't look 20yo, I'd assume 9428 and 9426 are year/week pairs.  so they're not even old enough to drink :)
[14:45] <directhex> kingston still exist. you'll get warranty service from them
[14:45] <directhex> the rest, not so much
[14:45] <shauno> Goldstar are LG, so there's another
[14:47] <directhex> lg don't make ram though
[14:48] <directhex> they don't make the memory, or the sticks. they're in no position to help
[14:52] <shauno> curious who the LGS etched on those chips is then
[14:53] <shauno> I know it's not something they do anymore, but depending on what their warranty offer was like, that could just make it all the more entertaining
[14:54] <directhex> huh, hynix bought LGS
[14:54] <directhex> hynix *does* exist
[15:27] <bubu> hi guys, trying to do an ssh loop script to echo some text into a file on multiple servers
[15:27] <bubu> so far I have
[15:28] <mgdm> You might be better looking into smething like dsh or pssh
[15:28] <mgdm> they're parallelized versions of ssh
[15:28] <bubu> for e in $(knife node list); do ssh $e; echo "node_name $e" >> /etc/test.txt ; done
[15:28] <bubu> but its not working - any ideas?
[15:29] <mgdm> you're sshing to a box, then after ssh finishes, you're running the echo
[15:29] <bubu> ah
[15:29] <mgdm> if you really want to do that, try or e in $(knife node list); do ssh $e 'echo "node_name $e" >> /etc/test.txt'; done
[15:29] <mgdm> note the quotes and the lack of ;
[15:29] <mgdm> but also look at dsh and pssh :)
[15:30] <bubu> ah oki
[15:40] <bubu> thanks mgdm !!
[15:40] <mgdm> you're welcome :)

[18:22] <ali1234> exobuzz: i tried interlaced modes. PAL failed - the fields get reversed
[18:22] <ali1234> NTSC works though
[18:25] <exobuzz> I suspected interlace might be a problem - often is even with screens that work fine otherwise. interesting that NTSC works though.
[18:27] <ali1234> i think the amiga is at fault tbh
[18:27] <ali1234> i bet it doesn't do the interlaced field run in properly
[18:27] <ali1234> you know, the half line thing
[18:28] <ali1234> lots of old computers just do a full line so effectively they are sending only upper or lower fields
[18:31] <directhex> tl;dr: interlaced sucks
[18:35] <exobuzz> my plasma deinterlaces amiga interlace modes (over scart). works quite well, not that I use my amiga on that screen
[18:36] <exobuzz> interlace is important for games like "hollywood poker pro" ;-)
[18:36] <exobuzz> great game that - music from chris huelsbeck too !

[21:23] <AlanBell> don't think the journalist really understood what was going on
[21:23] <AlanBell> but a popey quote is a popey quote \o/
[21:26] <ubuntubhoy> Not totally wrong TBH
[21:26] <Deindre> AlanBell: could I be a bit polemic?
[21:33] <AlanBell> sure Deindre
[21:34] <brunogirin> AlanBell: to be honest, I've seen a lot worse in tech review!
[21:35] <AlanBell> oh it wasn't bad at all, just the fact that it is on the samsung galaxy nexus doesn't mean that it is being released on that hardware as such
[21:35] <Deindre> AlanBell:  speaking as journalist, of course, journalist are all dumb. But sometimes journalist could make a better work, if the had better informations :)
[21:36] <Deindre> if they had, sorry
[21:36] <AlanBell> yeah, the article makes it sound a bit like Samsung is going to be selling nexus devices for ubuntu os
[21:36] <Deindre> I'm a journalst, I'm dumb too
[21:36]  * AlanBell thinks Deindre is not dumb
[21:37] <AlanBell> in fact everything in the article except for the headline and opening sentence seems great to me
[21:37]  * Deindre deeply thanks AlanBell :)
[21:38] <brunogirin> indeed, so once you go past that, it's not a bad article
[21:39] <brunogirin> unless the journalist knows exactly what he's doing and uses that headline on purpose to attract readers ;-)

[22:20] <popey> jnick_tait: http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/
[22:22] <Azelphur> We recognize HTML5 as a core Internet technology often used to develop cross-platform apps. As such, the Ubuntu toolkit offers the flexibility to support HTML5 too. 
[22:22] <Azelphur> ^ I wish android did this
[22:22] <Azelphur> popey: do you know if there are plans to support other devices, such as the Nexus 4?
[22:23] <Azelphur> (/7/10)
[22:24] <ubuntubhoy> source will drop, so I would guess it will be ported to everything
[22:25] <popey> we're just finalising the details of which devices will be supported
[22:25] <Azelphur> cool
[22:25] <popey> i would not be surprised if a nexus device or two was supported
[22:25] <Azelphur> yay
[22:25] <popey> by "supported" I mean "an image made"
[22:25] <Azelphur> if any nexus devices are supported, I'm in by default xD
[22:25] <popey> i doubt there will be any "support" ☺
[22:25] <Azelphur> hehe
[22:26] <Azelphur> living on my own is amusing, on the downside, my landlord doesn't do anything he's supposed to
[22:26] <Azelphur> on the upside, this includes collecting rent
[22:33] <zleap> anyone see te news report on the boing 787
[22:33] <zleap> the have what looks like a computer in the seat booting up with what looks like the kernel type output you get on some Linux desktops
[22:34] <ali1234> popey: yeah there you go with those words again :)
[22:34] <zleap> it then seems to display what could look like the ubuntu splashscreen
[22:35] <ali1234> anyway i doubt you'll need to make images for more than a couple of devices
[22:35] <ali1234> XDA developers will do the rest
[22:35] <ali1234> even if you don't release any source
[22:37] <popey> hmm?
[22:37] <popey> we will release the source
[22:37] <popey> thats for certain
[22:38] <ali1234> they probably won't us it anyway
[22:38] <ubuntubhoy> yeah they will
[22:38] <zleap> about 8 seconds in http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21038128
[22:38] <zleap> could be shutdown or start up not sure
[22:39] <Azelphur> ali1234: thats odd, why would they not use it?
[22:39] <ali1234> Azelphur: because they're used to not having it
[22:39] <ali1234> look at all the rom kitchens
[22:39] <ali1234> no source
[22:39] <Azelphur> they have it for android, and they all seem to wait until the source comes out from what I've read o.O
[22:39] <ali1234> doesn't stop them
[22:39]  * Azelphur shrugs
[22:40] <ali1234> xda has been around longer than android
[22:40] <Azelphur> yea I know
[22:40] <Azelphur> but they that ^ shows they do use the source if they have it :p
[22:40] <ali1234> sometimes
[22:40] <popey> well, they'll get it
[22:40] <Azelphur> :D
[22:40] <Azelphur> I like having the source to things.
[22:41] <ali1234> there's plenty of android roms that are just cooked versions of other roms
[22:41] <Azelphur> indeed
[22:41] <ali1234> lots of rebuilds of leaked roms for instance
[22:42] <ali1234> expect a lot of GPL violations
[22:42] <ubuntubhoy> ali1234: source is always preferred, porting without is a far bigger job
[22:43] <ali1234> there isn't much to port
[22:43] <ubuntubhoy> ?
[22:43]  * zleap was nearly rigt its a touch screen entertainment system running android http://www.ausbt.com.au/boeing-chooses-android-for-787-dreamliner-s-entertainment-system
[22:45] <ali1234> you know the main problem for anything that isn't android right now...
[22:45] <ali1234> android is starting to be used in some really weird stuff
[22:46] <ali1234> it's not really enough to be on phones now
[22:47] <zleap> well it runs limux so is still cool right
[22:47] <ali1234> yes and no
[22:48] <ali1234> it's not cool if you are trying to sell another platform
[22:48] <AlanBell> it will be the embedded GUI on anything where they can't be bothered to put physical buttons
[22:48] <ali1234> apple are probably crapping their pants right now
[22:48] <ubuntubhoy> competition will always be there
[22:48] <ali1234> you'll never see apple making an iOS oven or fridge
[22:48] <AlanBell> so your microwave control will just be a touchscreen running one app with android under it somewhere
[22:49] <ali1234> AlanBell: they already exist
[22:49] <AlanBell> running android?
[22:49] <ali1234> yes
[22:49] <popey> and fridges
[22:49] <ali1234> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXYmsVdqQEw <- there's a bunch in this
[22:51] <AlanBell> nice
[22:54] <ali1234> the problem is if you have an android tv, camera, oven, fridge... are you gonna buy an ubuntu smartphone?
[22:57] <ubuntubhoy> ali1234: as long as they can share data, then why not
[22:57] <ali1234> android shares data through google services
[22:57] <ubuntubhoy> that's why Google services being ported is a big deal
[22:57] <ali1234> who's porting it?
[22:57] <ubuntubhoy> the community will
[22:58] <ubuntubhoy> for most things
[22:58] <popey> unlikely
[22:58] <AlanBell> so, won't get done then
[22:58] <ali1234> i find it unlikely too
[22:58] <ubuntubhoy> lol
[22:58] <ubuntubhoy> nothing like faith
[22:58] <popey> well how can they?
[22:58] <ali1234> just because you can connect to google account with the api and somehow get the raw data, doesn't mean there will be an app that can use it in a meaningful way
[22:58] <popey> thats like saying the community will port skype
[22:58] <ubuntubhoy> hmm
[22:58] <ali1234> and also, if no one buys it, there won't be a community
[22:59] <ali1234> and if nobody ports this stuff, nobody will buy it
[22:59] <AlanBell> I quite like the SIP by default idea
[22:59] <ubuntubhoy> I still think that stuff with open api's will get ported
[23:00] <ali1234> a lot of it is NFC
[23:00] <ali1234> like the TV and phone combo
[23:00] <ali1234> just touch the phone on the TV remote, and get the phone display on the TV wirelessly
[23:00] <ubuntubhoy> but if you guys are right, then Ubuntu for Android could still be a bigger deal
[23:00] <ali1234> someone will probably port it but like everything else, it will be half finished and not work properly
[23:01] <ubuntubhoy> most Google stuff is still in beta anyway
[23:01] <ali1234> official status is irrelevant. the only thing that matters is does it work?
[23:01] <ali1234> and on android, yes, it does work
[23:02] <ubuntubhoy> mostly
[23:02] <ali1234> i'm sure syncing between ubuntu phone and ubuntu desktop will be wonderful
[23:02] <directhex> SIP works fine, as long as nobody has NAT or a firewall at either end
[23:02] <directhex> if they do, then it might work, maybe, ish, if the relevant STUN servers are working right. ish. maybe.
[23:02] <directhex> it also might fail silently
[23:03] <ali1234> SIP is poor :(
[23:03] <ali1234> skype just works
[23:03] <AlanBell> AIX just works
[23:03] <AlanBell> but anyhow, if the phone was VOIP by default and just used data then there would be no roaming, just get a local PAYG data sim
[23:03] <ali1234> license skype already!!!2
[23:04] <AlanBell> and you could provision it to your company PBX
[23:04] <directhex> skype support is done.
[23:04] <AlanBell> VPN client on the phone as part of the setup wizard too
[23:04] <directhex> what isn't done is the licensing, which is very hard to sort
[23:04] <ali1234> lol "company PBX"
[23:04] <AlanBell> yeah, Canonical won't sell it like that
[23:04] <ali1234> no, companies use skype!
[23:04] <AlanBell> consumer is king
[23:06] <ubuntubhoy> why would skype not make their own app ?
[23:06] <directhex> integration > app
[23:06] <ali1234> integration is key for everything
[23:06] <ubuntubhoy> not an integration in Android, but it gets used and downloaded
[23:07] <ali1234> skype on android is kind of bad
[23:07] <ali1234> you have to remember to start up the app every time the phone reboots
[23:07] <ali1234> it does integrate with contacts though
[23:08] <ali1234> it's hard to merge contacts on android though, dunno why, the UI just sucks for it
[23:08] <popey> directhex: whats happening with the empathy skype doohdah?
[23:08] <directhex> popey, nobody wants to pay to ship it on the desktop
[23:09] <ubuntubhoy> ali1234: my point was more, why would these companies not dev for Ubuntu OS also
[23:10] <directhex> e.g. h264 license
[23:10] <AlanBell> if I was doing the phone I would sell it as an asterisk applicance like this http://www.pikatechnologies.com/english/view.asp?x=347 plus a bunch of mobile handsets with data sims
[23:10] <AlanBell> leave Android and ios to fight over the consumers
[23:11] <ali1234> that's suicide
[23:11] <popey> hehe
[23:11] <ali1234> your lunch will be eaten by an identical product that runs android
[23:11] <ali1234> because everyone will go "hey android, i know what that is"
[23:11] <popey> seems there's a lot of people who don't
[23:11] <popey> (know what android / ios is)
[23:12] <ali1234> those people aren't making purchasig decisions for companies that actually need a SIP PBX
[23:12] <directhex> there must be a market for tier 4 ecosystems, given bb10, tizen, ubuntu, firefoxos, etc
[23:12] <directhex> there must be
[23:12] <directhex> but i don't know what that market is
[23:13] <AlanBell> there needs to be a niche where being different is an advantage, and you have to be able to articulate why you are different
[23:13] <ali1234> that's an interesting POV
[23:14] <ali1234> i wonder, how is being different ever an advantage? especially in the post-PC market?
[23:14] <AlanBell> well if you are not different, then you are "similar but not as good"
=== Lcawte is now known as Lcawte|Away
[23:14] <ali1234> how do you even make a phone that is "different"
[23:14] <AlanBell> don't have a phone number
[23:15] <ali1234> so you can't make phone calls?
[23:15] <AlanBell> yes, but you don't buy the phone number with the phone
[23:15] <ali1234> see, as soon as you make it different, you make it impossible for most people to understand :(
[23:15] <Azelphur> ali1234: everything starts of as a niche until it gets big
[23:15] <AlanBell> you get a sipgate number or an ubuntuone number if you are a consumer, or you have it as an extension on your PBX if you are not
[23:16] <ali1234> that's not a good way to sell products
[23:16] <Azelphur> on that basis different wouldn't be an advantage and we'd still be writing on pen and paper
[23:16] <ali1234> AlanBell: oh, so basically like google voice then?
[23:16] <Azelphur> the goal in computing is to be easier, faster and cheaper
[23:16] <AlanBell> ali1234: yes
[23:16] <ali1234> so this is different, how?
[23:16] <AlanBell> cuts out the negotiation with the carriers
[23:17] <AlanBell> I guess it would be like having google voice as the primary dialer
[23:17] <AlanBell> or your internal system
[23:17] <ali1234> google voice is fully integrated
[23:18] <ali1234> there is no "primary dialer" - everything is merged together
[23:18] <ali1234> you just say "call this guy" and it figures out the rest
[23:18] <ali1234> this is a solved problem - if everyone uses android that is
[23:18] <AlanBell> if you set it up as a thing
[23:18] <AlanBell> by default all your calls go through the carrier
[23:18] <AlanBell> you can install sipdroid or whatever
[23:18] <ali1234> no, there is no default
[23:19] <popey> what do you do about calling 911?
[23:19] <popey> there's regulatory controls around that
[23:19] <ali1234> once you have installed whatever app, the contacts can be merged
[23:19] <AlanBell> yeah, 911 would have to go through the carrier but you don't even need a sim card for that popey
[23:19] <ali1234> you don't need a voice codec in the phone though
[23:19] <popey> the carrier would tell you to gtfo
[23:19] <ali1234> *do
[23:19] <AlanBell> popey: nope
[23:20] <AlanBell> the carrier can't. You can roam, take the SIM out, do what the hell you like. If there is a signal then an emergency call must be carried
[23:20] <ali1234> i think he means they'll tell you to GTFO if you try to run your own VOIP system on their data network
[23:21] <ali1234> as they have multiple times in the past by blocking skype, google voice, and SIP traffic
[23:21] <AlanBell> if they sell a data sim then they sell a data sim
[23:21] <shauno> that's the bit that needs to change.  they need to realise they're isps more than telcos now
[23:21] <ali1234> yeah a data sim with 250mb and all VOIP protocols are blocked...
[23:21] <ali1234> vodafone made more money from data than voice in 2012Q4
[23:22] <ali1234> first telco to do so in europe
[23:22] <shauno> I still think this is odd; I pay more for 800mb for a smatphone, than I do for 20GB with a modem.  through the same operator
[23:23] <ali1234> the real thing you want is to be able to use the cheap GSM calls when out, but use free skype on wifi when at home
[23:23] <AlanBell> anyhow, unless the Ubuphone does something slightly off the wall like that then they will have to negotiate country by country with hostile carriers to get it subsidised and if the carrier doesn't like it they can pull the plug on the whole venture
[23:23] <ali1234> without having to know about it
[23:23] <ali1234> and yes, the phones can do this
[23:23] <ormiret> THe numbers are probably still off but mobile bandwidth is more expensive: everybody has the share the same air.
[23:24] <ali1234> GSM calls are incredibly compressed
[23:24] <shauno> I realise 3g data costs more than cable.  but this is a 3g modem vs a 3g phone, both on o2-ireland
[23:24] <ali1234> that's just silly loss leaders
[23:24] <AlanBell> and if there is nothing to differentiate the product then it is "like android or ios but without as many apps" if it is an otherwise perfect implementation
[23:25] <ali1234> yes, that's the problem
[23:25] <ali1234> look at WP8
[23:25] <ali1234> even if it was better than android... does it work with my android TV?
[23:26] <AlanBell> indeed, which is why I think the business market can be simpler
[23:26] <ali1234> the super transforming phone-computer-tv device all-in-one is not a good fix for this problem either
[23:26] <AlanBell> nope it isn't
[23:26] <ali1234> it's better to have multiple devices syncing to your google account
[23:27] <ali1234> but of course you need all android then
[23:27] <AlanBell> or I have to stand in the living room so my kids can watch stuff on my phone
[23:27] <ali1234> or all apple and iCloud
[23:27] <ali1234> or all WP8 and skydrive/live/whatever
[23:27] <AlanBell> the consumer stuff is all a lifestyle proposition
[23:27] <ali1234> the WP8 stuff is not as good as google and apple
[23:27] <ali1234> and there's no WP8 TV
[23:27] <ali1234> or windows-TV or whatever
[23:28] <ali1234> there's crufty old windows media center
[23:28] <ali1234> with a huge x86 HTPC
[23:28] <ali1234> that has noisy fans
[23:28] <directhex> (xbox)
[23:28] <ali1234> like we're stuck in 2003
[23:28] <ali1234> oh yeah there's xbox i forgot that
[23:28] <ali1234> so there you have it
[23:28] <directhex> you're part right
[23:29] <directhex> but what windows phone 7/8 does right, that say the n9 did awfully, is google is a first class citizen
[23:29] <directhex> calendar, mail, etc - on n900 using google calendar was hell
[23:29] <ali1234> it worked for me
[23:30] <ali1234> it did until they shut off exchange support anyway
[23:30] <directhex> i just gave up & went back to android within an hour of using an n900
[23:30] <ali1234> mail never really worked properly cos of my huge mailboxes
[23:30] <directhex> n9 lasted a couple of weeks before i gave up
[23:30] <ali1234> well yes, android is significantly better than anything else if you use all google services
[23:31]  * popey played with the ubuntu phone in the bar last night
[23:31] <popey> was fun
[23:31] <ali1234> but that is only to be expected
[23:31] <ali1234> i'm sure the ubuntu fone will work very well with ubuntuone email, if sucha thing ever exists
[23:31] <popey> shame it's running on a galaxy nexus
[23:31] <ali1234> the problem is everyone has gmail
[23:32] <shauno> and gizmodo didn't steal it?
[23:32] <popey> write an email app ☺
[23:32] <ali1234> you mean it doesn't have one??!?
[23:32] <popey> not today
[23:32] <ali1234> *facepalm*
[23:32] <popey> it doesnt ship today though
[23:32] <popey> there's loads of apps it doesnt have
[23:33] <popey> lots of opportunity there
[23:33] <ali1234> that's not an opportunity
[23:33] <dwatkins> ...not tomorrow, but soon...
[23:33] <ali1234> i mean presumably there is an opportunity to write a contact syncing app
[23:33] <Azelphur> hmm, any reason not to wash an old USB trackball with water?
[23:33] <ali1234> except we don't know how it will sync contacts
[23:34] <Azelphur> it needs some TLC XD
[23:34] <ali1234> but if it launches without this stuff... it's gonna fail
[23:34] <popey> the launch is way off
[23:35] <ubuntubhoy> remember any OEM that takes this will also put their developers on app creation
[23:35] <popey> plenty of time for someone to write some apps
[23:35] <popey> they will?
[23:35] <ali1234> there better be a sync connector API by MWC
[23:36] <popey> why?
[23:36] <ubuntubhoy> popey: directed at me ?
[23:36] <ali1234> because if there isn't everyone will just point and laugh at you
[23:37] <ubuntubhoy> if so, just look at all the OEM's who use android - how many supply AOSP
[23:37] <popey> We'll see :0
[23:37] <directhex> ubuntu phone's lead time right now is insane. this is a market where an exec needs no longer than 6 weeks from announcing "we need a new phone, it must be PURPLE and SIXTEEN CORE and have a MIPS processor" before hardware has landed in every phone shop in the world
[23:38] <dwatkins> MIPS just got bought out
[23:38] <AlanBell> I am a bit confused by the API stuff for the phone, it doesn't seem very phoneish
[23:39] <ali1234> and yes, the phone vendors will set there developers on it... they'll want to completely reskin the UI
[23:39] <ali1234> to work like their android phones
[23:39] <AlanBell> worst possible thing that could be done /o\
[23:39] <ali1234> the HTC guy will be like "how do we port sense to this?"
[23:40] <dwatkins> I have an HTC phone, and I'm having to look HTC Sense up because it's run Cyanogenmod for so long.
[23:40] <AlanBell> I am running CM10 on my Galaxy S2 now
[23:40] <ali1234> then the carriers will want their branding all over it
[23:41] <ali1234> and their own app store
[23:41] <dwatkins> sadly my Desire HD only runs up to CM7.
[23:41] <AlanBell> I might go for firefoxOS at some point
[23:41] <ali1234> android is too good
[23:41] <ali1234> i don't know why anyone wouldn't like it
[23:42] <AlanBell> I am an outlier
[23:42] <AlanBell> I don't like phones much
[23:42] <ali1234> i will run ubuntu phone
[23:42] <AlanBell> scares me when it rings
[23:42] <ali1234> but i fully expect it to be painful, like running linux was 7 years ago
[23:43] <ali1234> where android users laugh at me because nothing works properly
[23:43] <dwatkins> if it's as open as Ubuntu, the modding community will love it
[23:44] <dwatkins> a colleague complained about my linux vmware server the other day, I think he'd tried to use it once on a day it was still being setup - it hasn't been rebooted since then, and has worked flawlessly
[23:44] <dwatkins> admittedly, it's running vmware 2.0, but it's as solid as something rather rock-like
[23:45]  * AlanBell installs the firefoxOS simulator
[23:45] <dwatkins> I wanted something with a web-based interface, even if I have to use *spit* IE in order to run the console browser plugin
[23:45] <ubuntubhoy> AlanBell: why not just build it for your S2 and dual boot ?
[23:46] <ali1234> cos it isn't finished?
[23:47] <ubuntubhoy> but it builds and kind of runs
[23:47] <ubuntubhoy> and will dual boot with Siyah kernel
[23:50] <AlanBell> interesting
[23:51] <ubuntubhoy> very easy to build
[23:51] <ubuntubhoy> even built on my netbook
