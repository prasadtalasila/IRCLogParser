[01:15] <holstein> tagava: i doubt grub has anything to do with it.. i would look into reinstalling.. i would run sudo apt-get update and see if there are errors
[03:13] <user5433> Problem:  No sound from internal speakers on Compaq nx7010 laptop.  Headphones work though.   Checked alsamixer volumes up.
[03:21] <holstein> user5433: could be.. i would suggest trying different kernels and alsa versions from live CD's, and checking out...
[03:21] <holstein> !sound
[03:21] <ubottu> If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.

[10:34] <hpuser44551> How to make a user application autostart on bootup?
[10:34] <hpuser44551> is there an autostart folder I can use to put a script or link a .desktop file?
[10:35] <tsimpson> hpuser44551: ~/.config/autostart/
[10:35] <hpuser44551> checking..
[10:36] <hpuser44551> there is no autostart folder there.  Do i just make one?
[10:36] <tsimpson> you can, yes
[10:36] <tsimpson> though that's for starting upon user login, not necessarily on boot
[10:37] <hpuser44551> yep that's what i want
[10:37] <tsimpson> that'll do the job then
[10:38] <hpuser44551> where should i put boot scripts?
[10:39] <hpuser44551> i was using /etc/rc.local to configure alsa.  That ok for other boot scripts?
[10:39] <tsimpson> generally that's fine
[10:40] <hpuser44551> I want to install xcompmgr for desktop effects. Just in case i need to automate it at bootup.
[10:40] <hpuser44551> Thanks
[10:40] <tsimpson> there's also the old sys-v style stuff, init scripts, you put in /etc/init.d and create links in /etc/rc*.d
[10:40] <tsimpson> and then there's upstart, which has config files in /etc/init
[10:41] <tsimpson> /etc/rc.local is the simplest, followed by the sys-v style init scripts, and finally upstart jobs. though the latter ones offer more power then the former ones
[10:43] <hpuser44551> got it. Thanks
[14:21] <gene_> can anyone help me about lubuntu panel. After i have applied a gtk theme the panel will show off and gone repeatedly like refreshing itself. How could i change the gtk theme back to any other. Since i couldn't open the menu, i can't open customize look and feel
[16:52] <devmark> how do i change keyboard settings_
=== rastamouse is now known as nothingspecial
[21:37] <wxl> so this is one of those probably-has-nothing-to-do-with-linux questions, but i just put raring on an hp pavilion and it seems that i get double characters out of some keys. for example, n gives me n6. this happens in virtual terminal, even when editing grub settings when booting up a live environment. however, as far as i know it didn't have this problem with it had windows on it. i got it for free and wiped it immediately so can't test. ideas/
[21:37] <wxl> s/with/when/
[21:41] <Unit193> I'd check in xev, and see if it's any sort of known issue in #ubuntu+1  Otherwise, sounds fun!
[21:42] <wxl> what's super weird is that both keys do it. i.e. i get n6 from both n and 6
[21:42] <Unit193> Heh, can you check with another keyboard?
[21:42] <wxl> well i could get an external couldn't i
