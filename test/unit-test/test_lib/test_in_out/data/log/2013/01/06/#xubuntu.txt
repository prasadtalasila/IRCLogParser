[05:00] <OvchinnikovDA> Всем привет! Есть кто русскоязычный?
[05:57] <atreyu_> Hi
[05:59] <atreyu_> Xubuntu have windows installer?
[06:12] <topper4125> they do... but its my opinion to just install witha duel boot off a iso install
[06:12] <topper4125> or just a full install and dump windows :)
[06:14] <topper4125> atreyu, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1961647 install xubuntu via wubi
[06:15] <atreyu_> topper4125: thanks
[06:20] <link0r> are people talking in here?
[06:20] <link0r> where is the chat for talkers?
[06:33] <atreyu_> dammit
[06:33] <atreyu_> "Since 12.10, Xubuntu was removed from Wubi by the request of the Xubuntu project lead."
=== gro is now known as gro__
[06:40] <topper4125> well 12.04.1 is LTS...longer support if you still want to give it a try.. .I personally don't do xubuntu,I use full Ubuntu install, then put on the XFCE 4.10 Desktop on top of it...
[06:41] <atreyu_> well, i guess i will try that way :)
[06:41] <topper4125> Good luck! :D
[06:43] <topper4125> Hint: If you want, install ubuntu with wubi, then "sudo apt-get xubuntu-desktop" for full Xubuntu Experience, or "Sudo apt-get install XFCE4" for a plain vanilla xfce 4.8 install. to get a 4.10 you need to add a PPA

[09:25] <BlackDalek> hey... in the middle of installing xubuntu alongside my regular ubuntu - I am at the paritioning screen.. there is a left side and a right side but utterly no explanantion which side is which :( ... is xubunut the left side or right side?
[09:26] <BlackDalek> hello?
[09:46] <grok__> BlackDalek, one way is logging into ubuntu and typing 'mount' into a terminal, then you'd see a line like "/dev/sda1 on /"
[09:48] <BlackDalek> what? no.. I mean the screen with the big box with a slider you can move from left to right... I assume one side is ubuntu and the other side is xubuntu, but which is which?
[09:52] <grok__> The LiveCD installer won't tell you.
[09:54] <BlackDalek> so are we expected to guess?
[09:55] <grok__> No, you are expected to find out by other means.
[09:55] <BlackDalek> I would guess the left is the new xubuntu and right side is old ubuntu?
[09:55] <BlackDalek> but the sections on the install screen are not even labeled
[09:56] <grok__> Do you see something like "sda" on the screen?
[09:56] <grok__>  /dev/sda
[09:56] <grok__> And ext4 near any of them?
[09:56] <BlackDalek> no the box just says 198mb one side and 196mb other side
[09:56] <BlackDalek> no lab rls
[09:56] <BlackDalek> labels
[09:57] <grok__> Are you using the XUbuntu LiveCD installer?
[10:07] <BlackDalek> yes.
[10:08] <BlackDalek> there is no labels on the partition resizer... if I click on the advance partitioning thing, it shows the disk /dev/sda/whatever.. but can't see any way to resize..
[10:11] <BlackDalek> why does the resizer not tell you which partition is which?
[10:12] <BlackDalek> can I just assume that the left side is the new xubuntu side of the graph?
[10:12] <BlackDalek> isn't that how is normally works? new side left - right side original partition/windows partition, etc...
[10:13] <grok__> No, xubuntu has not been installed yet, the graph is what you have now.
[10:14] <grok__> There's a tool on the LiveCD, it's called GParted
[10:14] <BlackDalek> I thought the graph was for making a new partition to install xubuntu to?
[10:14] <grok__> hm, please ignore my last comment.
[10:14] <grok__> You see a table on the screen
[10:15] <BlackDalek> yes
[10:15] <grok__> The list of partitions and their types
[10:15] <grok__> Below, there are two small buttons + and -
[10:15] <grok__> And a button "Change..."
[10:15] <BlackDalek> no.. that is only visible if I click "advanced partitioning" under the graph.
[10:15] <grok__> With the button "Change..." you can resize.
[10:15] <BlackDalek> ah.. ok
[10:16] <grok__> Uh? Well, I'm assuming you have a need for sadvanced partitioning, if that's not thwe case, then you'd better choose the appropriate option to install alongside UBUNTU
[10:16] <grok__> sorry, Ubuntu*
[10:17] <BlackDalek> I just think the graph thing is stupid... it SHOULD be labeled more clearly than just [   198mb    |        197mb   ]
[10:18] <BlackDalek> thanks for your help
[10:18] <grok__> you're welcome.
[10:19] <grok__> Whatever you choose, you will be able to reformat later, after the installation, and you can change the partitions in the file /etc/fstab in the XUbuntu partition.
[10:24] <grok__> And, if you do not need two separate installations, if the goal is just to have the XUbuntu desktop, then you can write this into an Ubuntu terminal:
[10:24] <grok__> sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
=== Alan_ is now known as Guest60839
[10:28] <BlackDalek> the goal is to have just ubuntu 12.10 desktop. Problem is regular ubuntu 12.10 won't run on this old PC. But xubuntu 12.10 does run... so plan is to install xubuntu 12.10 along-side ubuntu 11.04, then copy user data from ubuntu partition to xubuntu, then delete ubuntu parition and resize xubuntu to fill whole disk....
[10:33] <grok__> What about copying user data to a second disk?
[10:33] <BlackDalek> don't have one spare.
[10:34] <BlackDalek> why? Is there a problem with my plan?
[10:34] <grok__> Alternatively, if the user data is inside the /home, you may copy to a second partition on the same disk, then install Xubuntu over Ubuntu and retain the partition (and thus the data).
[10:36] <grok__> No problem, I was just thinking that  it will take a lot of time :)
[10:37] <BlackDalek> ok. I have to go finish this. bye

[15:23] <qasim> TheSheep, i have gone through those sites...applied all what they sai ..my prob is still there
[15:59] <dormito_> I have a new asus r11cx with has, as far as i understand a cedarview gfx chip. its an atom n2600 I believe. I am running xubuntu 12.04. my issue ofcourse is that while I've looked at alot of guides online I can seem to get the gfx fully functional. I was unable get the propriety drivers (from the repository) to install (in a manner that yeilded a bootable system) after much tinkering around I got a build of the 3.8 kernel to give me
[15:59] <dormito_> 1024x600 (the native for the hw should be 1360x768 i think) and lshw reports that its using the gma500_gfx driver.  Is this infact the correct driver? and if so, since my gui display settings only list 1024x600 as the possiblity, how would I fix the xserver setup?
[16:20] <mfdoom> is there a way to do a "core / barebones" install of xubuntu?
[16:20] <mfdoom> I want to use the xubuntu installer, but I don't want all the additional apps installed, such as office utils
[16:25] <mfdoom> should I just install ubuntu server, and then install xfce4 and xubuntu-default-settings?
[16:45] <xubuntu716> Hi there
[16:45] <xubuntu716> I´m having big problems installing AMD drivers
[16:46] <xubuntu716> Is there a incompatibility between UEFI and xununt?
[18:05] <Ronalds_M> I have 700 mb CD RW disk, can I burn xubuntu on it?
[18:06] <Ronalds_M> and is it possible for my old AMD athlon 2.2 ghz 700mb RAM to run flash in linux?
[18:07] <Ronalds_M> I tried Lubuntu, but installation failed, so I installed Ubuntu default derrivative and then installed Lubuntu desktop-but the flash doesn't work at all, gnash is just slow and whole system become a mess in this process
[18:07] <devlos> the cd should fit
[18:08] <Ronalds_M> so 12.10 needs DVD or 800mb disks?
[18:10] <devlos> you could use 12.4 an then upgrade, if you cant install 12.10 because of size
[18:11] <Ronalds_M> Ok, I can try
[18:11] <Ronalds_M> but the problem is that lubuntu installation failed
[18:12] <Ronalds_M> with this cd/rw
[18:12] <devlos> id recomend just buying a usbstick they are quite cheep at wallmart - $7.99 for a 16gb stick
[18:12] <Ronalds_M> wallmart in Latvia :D
[18:13] <devlos> ok i dont even know if thats a country or town :)
[18:13] <Ronalds_M> that's a country in Baltic states
[18:14] <Ronalds_M> 12,04 also weiths
[18:14] <Ronalds_M> 715 mb
[18:14] <Ronalds_M> I guess burning should go fine
[18:15] <Ronalds_M> newest flash version in linux asks for 2.3 ghz
[18:15] <Ronalds_M> when I have 2.2
[18:15] <devlos> ooh, i see you learn something everyday if your lucky.   12.4 32bit is 678 and 64bit 698.. both should burn ok
[18:16] <devlos> well my pc has well under 2gzh and plays flash fine. but i also have a newer pc
[18:17] <Ronalds_M> it's AMD athlon
[18:17] <Ronalds_M> old crappy and with nvidia 128 mb
[18:18] <Ronalds_M> lubuntu 12.04 seems buggy and I just want clean install
[18:18] <devlos> any more advanced users have any advice for him?? im out of ideas. i do recomend xubuntu over lubuntu any day.
[18:19] <Ronalds_M> it seems that ubuntu irc is full always
[18:19] <Ronalds_M> this irc doesn't have enough users
[18:20] <Ronalds_M> I glad I can use ubuntu on my i5 laptop, but I need light windows xp alternative for my older pc
[18:20] <devlos> it doesnt matter where you get help from. i also use the #pcbsd channel :)
[18:21] <Ronalds_M> they do linux questions?
[18:21] <devlos> no
[18:21] <Ronalds_M> lol
[18:25] <devlos> ok Ronalds_M  im leaving and hopefully the masters will help you from here, dont give up on xubuntu though 12.4 should fit on your disk.
[20:28] <jamin> is there a general way to inhibit volume automounting for a period of time?  I've searched and found the commands for udisks but that doesn't seem to have the desired affect as many volumes still get mounted (I suspect this is due to udisks2)
[21:45] <xubuntu472> hi is this a place i can get assistance creating a bootable windows xp when i already have xubuntu 12.04 installed?
[21:45] <Noskcaj> xubuntu472, really you want windows installed first
[21:46] <xubuntu472> yeah all the info i've found thus far has implied what you just said
[21:46] <xubuntu472> I have a windows microxp iso, i am not sure how to revert back to windows however
[21:47] <xubuntu472> i've been trying to find software that can burn a bootable cd, but i have had difficulty finding a linux software that can create a windows boot cd
[21:55] <grok__> Hi, xubuntu472, you can also try in the channel #ubuntu
[21:56] <xubuntu472> ok thank you
