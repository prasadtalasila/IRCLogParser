[01:41] <pleia2> Xubuntu being deployed by the freegeek.org folks http://imgur.com/a/CDi50#3
[01:41] <pleia2> trying to get an interview for a blog post
[05:20] <Pezikrypt> Good evening. :)
[05:22] <pleia2> hello Pezikrypt
[05:22] <Pezikrypt> So, I was over in Reddit's SysAdmin chat and they suggested Xubuntu for me, since I have zero experience with anything.
[05:23] <pleia2> well it's a desktop OS, not server
[05:23] <Pezikrypt> I know.
[05:23] <Pezikrypt> I'm just running it in a VM.
[05:24] <pleia2> ah, I tend to think server when I think sysadmin :)
[05:24] <Pezikrypt> Yeah, that's usually what they talk about.
[05:24] <Pezikrypt> I'm just wanting to get some experience doing something... they suggested this.
[05:25] <pleia2> well, this is the development channel if you're interested in contributing :) support is over in #xubuntu and we talk about random things over in #xubuntu-offtopic
[05:25] <Pezikrypt> Awesome, thanks for the links! (I was just about to ask a question.) ;)
[05:26] <pleia2> yeah, lots more people in the support channel so questions are best over there ;)
[05:26] <Pezikrypt> Thanks. :)
