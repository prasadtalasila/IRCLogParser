[00:20] <stgraber> xnox: why lightdm? last I checked we were the "upstream" for wallpaper.c
[00:21] <xnox> stgraber: note the comment at the top of it "mostly stolen from lightdm"
[00:21] <xnox> stgraber: yeah, we are upstream. And it's not working with raring, and i'm not sure how or why.
[00:21] <stgraber> xnox: yeah, then I rewrote half of it and didn't update the comment ;)
[00:22] <xnox> stgraber: no worries, I was poking plymouth this whole time, as lightdm is still bzr branching.....
[00:22]  * xnox any minute now "| Fetching revisions:Inserting stream:repacking texts:texts 922333/961583"
[00:23] <stgraber> xnox: might be worth trying to revert my commit and see if it magically works without it. I had to do some weird tricks to get it working last time it wasn't painting but maybe I just ended up working around a bug that has since been fixed
[00:23] <xnox> stgraber: hmm... let me try that.
[00:24] <xnox> on the other hand in raring my networking is broken in the VMs so I am having fun fixing them - well whacking the hammer of purging all *kvm* and reinstalling.
[00:24] <stgraber> ah yeah, the commit message reminds me of why I had to do it. metacity with compositing enabled (probably compiz too) didn't really like the old version of the tool
[00:24] <xnox> maybe I should try enabling compositing in compiz then?
[00:24] <stgraber> xnox: you're probably being hit by the NetworkManager flushes all the interfaces from virbrX bug :)
[00:24] <stgraber> xnox: which was fixed a couple of hours ago
[00:24] <xnox> oooh. let me upgrade and check =)
[00:25]  * xnox didn't load compositing plugin in compiz.
[00:25] <stgraber> I haven't tested the fix, but broken libvirt and lxc bridges was definitely the symptom ;)
[00:25] <stgraber> hmm, compiz without compositing, that sounds weird ;)
[00:26] <xnox> it's quick =) and awesome. I don't even let people move or resize windows.
[00:26] <xnox> but I guess I will have to enable that =)
[00:26] <xnox> due to error messages popups and cause users can click on URLs and open them by mistake.
[00:26] <stgraber> sounds like something you'd expect from a window manager ;)
[00:27] <xnox> yeah, apperantly it's a non-core plugin in compiz. Clearly rain-drops is a core plugin on the other hand.
[00:27]  * xnox thinks compiz has their priorities right way around
