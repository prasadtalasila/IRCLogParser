[13:00] <giuseppe__> hello
[13:06] <zequence> smartboyhw: tutti in Italian means all
[13:06] <smartboyhw> zequence, sorry for my inadequate knowledge in foreign languages...
[13:08] <zequence> smartboyhw: I only know some words because I've studied music
[13:08] <zequence> tutti is one of those words you see a lot
[13:08] <smartboyhw> zeqtest, oh
[13:08] <zequence> also, my sister lives in Italy, so I catch some when I visit her
[13:08] <smartboyhw> zequence, why is there a zeqtest? Is it yours?:P
[13:09] <zequence> Yeah, I was testing another solution for keeping irc logged on 24/7
[13:11] <smartboyhw> zequence, gee

[13:54] <BTDhero> Lump|AFK: Hi again
[14:45] <Lump|AFK> heya
[14:45] <Lump|AFK> sory was down in the shop
[15:32] <BTDhero> aaaaand I'm back again
[15:58] <Lump|AFK> heya
[15:59] <BTDhero> here
[15:59] <BTDhero> I got a first answer from the local music equipment shops
[16:00] <Lump|AFK> kk
[16:00] <Lump|AFK> and it was?
[16:00] <Lump|AFK> also be patient with me today
[16:00] <Lump|AFK> i will be back and forth alot
[16:00] <Lump|AFK> but i will leave this window open and read up each time i return
[16:01] <BTDhero> They don't have H2 ... but they will have soon a H1 and a H4n.  As fas as I was told, they could get me a H2n if I ask for one, at a price of 200€.
[16:03] <Lump|AFK> the h4n will work
[16:03] <Lump|AFK> i have never used the h1, but it might be enough
[16:03] <Lump|AFK> but if they are getting a h4n anyhow and you can just rent it
[16:03] <Lump|AFK> that would be the easiest ticket
[16:04] <Lump|AFK> you could use the internal mics and two external ones and end up with 4 isolated tracks
[16:04] <Lump|AFK> or you could just use the built in and do right to stereo
[16:12] <BTDhero> The h4n would be almost 200€, I guess, so I hope I can rent it. I'll be back in a few hours
[16:20] <Lump|AFK> yeah if you are only looking to do an occasional recording that is the way to go
[16:20] <Lump|AFK> but you need not stick with zoom brand
[16:20] <Lump|AFK> just something like that
[16:27] <efox> anyone have experience getting video off a canon T2i? I'm new to studio and not sure where I need to start.
[16:35] <xrs> http://www.madox.net/blog/2008/11/25/how-to-open-canon-cr2-raws-in-ubuntu/
[16:39] <xrs> basicly you need GIMP and UFRaw
[16:50] <efox> xrs: I guess i should be more specific. I'm talking about video editing... the t2i saves in .mov variable bitrate MPEG-4 AVC / H.264
[16:52] <holstein> efox: we have the same codec support that ubuntu has
[16:52] <holstein> efox: nothing about ubuntu/linux keeps those codecs from being used/edited
[16:52] <holstein> !codec

[16:53] <holstein> sometimes, you can get the devices to make more "friendly" codecs.. sometimes, you can add support for the codecs.. sometimes you can convert.. sometimes you are not given the opportunity to use the devices you purchase with the operating system you are using
[16:54] <holstein> in the last case, this can be *any* device on *any* operating system...
[17:01] <efox> holstein: ok. just trying to figure it out. http://pastebin.com/qGtc2wb9
[17:03] <holstein> efox: if you have no h264 support, you wont be able to use h264... thats true of any operating system
[17:03] <holstein> what would i do? try and make a friendlier format file on the camera and test
[17:04] <holstein> try and use a known good h264 file that did *not* come from the camera
[17:04] <holstein> try and reduce the variables and troubleshoot
[17:05] <holstein> right now, you have a camera you dont know how well works with ubuntu, opening files you may not have ever opened on any device other than the camera that created them, in a formant that you are not sure works with ubuntu
[17:05] <holstein> i would try and whittle those variables down and try and see what is breaking down
[17:06] <holstein> MOV: missing header (moov/cmov) chunk! Maybe broken file...
[17:06] <holstein> ^ maybe its a bad file created be the camera... thats why i would try a known good file that the camera didnt create
[17:07] <efox> holstein: i can edit perfectly fine in windows with sony vegas I just wanted to test studio out with what I had. Unfortunately, it looks like I'lll have to convert formats to make it work
[17:07] <holstein> i would try playing these files in VLC
[17:07] <holstein> efox: or add codec support for ubuntu
[17:07] <holstein> efox: you *cant* compare the experience in windows
[17:07] <holstein> efox: the camera is made to work with windows and comes with support for windows
[17:08] <efox> holstein: im installing vlc right now
[17:08] <holstein> efox: again, nothing in ubuntu/linux is preventing sony, or anyone else from providing you a supported end-user experience in ubuntu
[17:08] <efox> holstein: and mac
[17:08] <holstein> efox: sure
[17:08] <holstein> efox: *none* of that matters
[17:09] <holstein> efox: you cannot compare a device being used on a supported platform to how it works on an unsupported one
[17:09] <efox> holstein: i'm not trying to get into a debate about it i'm just trying to figure it out. that's all.
[17:09] <holstein> efox: that being said, you *can* add h264 support AFAIK
[17:09] <holstein> efox: nor am i.. i am just stating facts
[17:10] <holstein> efox: i am not debating anythig.. the fact is, that camera doesnt provide you with ubuntu support
[17:10] <holstein> ubuntu is not allowed ot
[17:10] <holstein> so, you are kind of on your own
[17:10] <holstein> !codec

[17:10] <holstein> ^^ should tell you how to add codec support for h264
[17:10] <holstein> then, you should be able to pull the files off the cam, and read/edit or whatever you lke
[17:10] <holstein> like*
[17:11] <holstein> but, the experience will not be like it was on either of the supported platforms
[17:11] <holstein> i usually just install the "ubuntu-restricte-extras" metapackage
[17:12] <holstein> efox: we are not allowed to provide "out of the box" support for h264
[17:12] <efox> holstein: I install the restricted-extras package first thing.
[17:13] <holstein> efox: does it provide h264 support?
[17:13] <efox> holstein: I'm still checking
[17:13] <holstein> efox: i would open vlc, and open a known good h264 file
[17:14] <holstein> http://askubuntu.com/questions/114872/how-can-i-get-h-264-support
[17:14] <holstein> sudo apt-get install x264
[17:15] <efox> holstein: I will, i'm in the process of double checking everything right now. and I'll see what I find.
[17:15] <efox> holstein: thanks for your help
[17:15] <holstein> !info x264
[17:15] <ubottu> x264 (source: x264): video encoder for the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC standard. In component universe, is optional. Version 2:0.123.2189+git35cf912-1 (quantal), package size 324 kB, installed size 767 kB
[17:18] <efox> holstein: I just install x264 and no bueno... it may be a bad file. i'll record a new one and see
[17:20] <holstein> sure, or in an effort for remove that camera from the equation, get a known good file from another source
[17:25] <efox> holstein: bingo! bad file. Copied a new one over and it played perfectly. Now maybe I can edit it. Thank you so much!
[17:26] <holstein> efox: cheers
[17:28] <xrs> my sound has suddenly stopped working. i remember there being an update for alsa and some other sound related stuff since the last time i used sound on this machine.
[17:31] <holstein> xrs: i would look into if it is JACK related, or pulse. i would just restart, and troubleshoot from there
[21:31] <xrs> having an odd issue: when downloading files specified to save to my external hard drive, the files appear to go to the drive; they are there if i view it in thunar, but if i unplug the drive, the files are not on it, the file are instead located in /media/$user/$drive (where they would have been if the drive was connected)
[21:31] <holstein> im not following
[21:32] <xrs> "/" is only 16 GB so the download usually errors out reporting there is no space left on the drive ("/" is full, the 60GB external has tons of space)
[21:32] <holstein> take "downloading files" out of the equation
[21:32] <holstein> take a file, and put it on the drive, and talk me through from there
[21:36] <xrs> well right now / has 0 bytes free cuz i started downloading an ISO (specified it to download to the 60GB external) and left to take care of some stuff. now im getting a boat load of error messages because there is no free space on /. i want to move the file to the external but accounding to the file system, its already there. if i unplug the drive, all the files disappear from the dir where the 60gb is mounted except the file i was do
[21:36] <xrs> wnloading. cant move it to the 60GB cuz its "already there"
[21:39] <xrs> using thunar i just moved a picture from /home/$user/Pictures to the 60GB and i heard it write something to the disk, the activity LED came on so i assume its really there
[21:40] <Lump|AFK> holstein: not trying to patronize you, but you seem to really get it... darn glad i met you
[21:40] <xrs> holstein,  knows his stuff
[21:41] <Lump|AFK> no doubt
[21:41] <holstein> i do what i can :) ...i wish i knew more, but im pretty good at troubleshooting, usually
[21:42] <holstein> xrs: sometimes, i have seen "odd" things happen with the trash... not that that is happening there for you
[21:42] <Lump|AFK> i do what i can but i am more old skewl like my equipment
[21:43] <holstein> Lump|AFK: hehe.. old skewl is the best skewl
[21:43] <len-1304> xrs you may need to remove /media/user/drive as a directory so that the mounting software can mount it properly
[21:43] <xrs> i moved the external to this computer because it was doing the same thing on the computer i normally have it attatched to so its either a software issue, or theres something going on with this USB hard drive
[21:44] <Lump|AFK> len-1304, for the record, rawks as well
[21:44] <efox> old age and treachery my friends...
[21:45] <holstein> yeah, im with len-1304 on that xrs
[21:46] <len-1304> strange things happen when mounting on a directory that is already populated.
[21:46] <xrs> in your opinion what would be the most likely cause?   this is the first time its been plugged into this computer, i gave it ample time for the two to talk to each other and the same problem on both systems
[21:48] <len-1304> I haven't had that problem here. I often use a USB / drive and have been able to plug in a second USB drive and write to it.
[21:48] <xrs> ookay i just unmounted the drive and got a pop up notification "there is still data waiting to be written to the drive. do not unplug the device
[21:49] <len-1304> That is normal.
[21:49] <xrs> no activity from the drive
[21:50] <len-1304> That is not. Any message with dmesg or less /var/log/syslog?
[21:50] <xrs> iotop reports no throughput at all
[21:51] <xrs> ojh yeah. lots of error messages
[21:51] <xrs> i suspect the drive is faulty
[21:52] <len-1304> Check all the plugs inside the case. unplug replug the drive itself inside.
[21:54] <xrs> theres the problem. broken pin on the USB to IDE adapter
[21:55] <len-1304> That would do it.
[22:03] <Lump|AFK> on another topic
[22:03] <Lump|AFK> just noticed something about synergy
[22:04] <holstein> i want to like/use synergy, but i end up disabling networking on my audio machines anyways
[22:04] <Lump|AFK> if that gui front end starts eating all your resources on the server machine
[22:04] <holstein> it was buggy there for a minute
[22:04] <Lump|AFK> kill it and you can still connect to clients
[22:04] <holstein> Lump|AFK: quicksynergy?
[22:04] <Lump|AFK> no don't run that per say
[22:05] <Lump|AFK> look in sytem monitor
[22:05] <Lump|AFK> there are two
[22:05] <Lump|AFK> maybe it is the same as quick but i don't have that installed
[22:05] <Lump|AFK> i am running that beta deb install one
[22:05] <Lump|AFK> i am not too good with all those terms
[22:06] <Lump|AFK> but i think quick was something different, maybe not, maybe incorporated in the latest beta
[22:06] <holstein> and i havent checked in on synergy in a while
[22:06] <Lump|AFK> well syunergys is still running
[22:07] <Lump|AFK> and, as you can tell, i am able to type
[22:07] <Lump|AFK> i killed the "synergy" in system monitor to do so
[22:08] <Lump|AFK> not the first time i have dealt with it that way either
[22:09] <Lump|AFK> ntl, i have to scoot atm
[22:09] <Lump|AFK> ttyl
[22:22] <xrs> thanx 4 the help
[22:22] <holstein> xrs: broken pin!.. sorry about that...
[22:22] <holstein> xrs: glad you got it sorted out though... and you know whats going on
[22:23] <xrs> well at least its cheap to replace a drive enclosure. that one was older than time any way
