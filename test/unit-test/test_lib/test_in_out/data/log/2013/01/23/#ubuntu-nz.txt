[18:07] <ibeardslee> morning
[18:52] <snail> now back from paternity leave, so i'll be around more
[19:15] <ajmitch> morning
[19:19] <ibeardslee> .. except maybe for those mornings after 'one of those nights'? ;)
[19:30] <ajmitch> heh
[19:30] <ajmitch> hads: what router are you using with UFB?
[19:46] <mwhudson> morning
[19:58] <chilts> morning
[19:58] <chilts> snail: congrats by the way :)
[20:10] <snail> chilts: thanks, but not much of the work was mine...
[20:22] <chilts> heh, I'm sure there will be more to come
[21:10] <hads> ajmitch: I'm still undecided for the long term. Thinking about trying out one of the new Ubuiqity Edgerouters when they are released. At the moment I'm using an old Draytek 2820
[21:11] <hads> Although this morning I'm connected through a Fritzbox that Snap supplied because they are trying to figure out why my upstream is only 10Mbit still.
[21:11]  * ajmitch was thinking of getting one of those alix boards for it, but it might not be up to it from what I've read
[21:12] <ajmitch> I got the letter from chorus that they'll be digging up the street soonish
[21:12] <hads> No I don't think the Alix will be able to route 100Mbit
[21:12] <hads> Especially not if you want to do QoS or anything.
[21:12] <hads> I was using an Alix with OpenWRT up until UFB
[21:13] <hads> http://www.ubnt.com/edgemax - see the last paragraph
[21:13] <ajmitch> does snap use pppoe for UFB?
[21:14] <hads> Yes
[21:14] <ajmitch> that's a rather shiny page
[21:16] <ajmitch> are you going to resell them?
[21:18] <hads> I don't have a distributor for Ubiquiti stuff so probably not. GoWiFi in Christchurch sell it.
[21:19] <ajmitch> $159+GST but out of stock, not too bad I guess
[21:20]  * ajmitch doesn't expect to get UFB hooked up for at least a couple of months
[21:57] <chilts> fmarier: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21159531 :)
[22:06] <fmarier> chilts: yes these are the phones we'll be giving away (well, vouchers for these phones) for the best demos on saturday :)
[22:09] <chilts> heh, cool
[22:09]  * chilts didn't know that :)
[22:10]  * ibeardslee really needs to start thinking on what he could create
[22:11] <ibeardslee> and suddenly has a brilliant idea
[22:16] <fmarier> the app i'm working on is this one: http://fmarier.github.com/fxos-iamrich/
[22:16] <fmarier> inspired of course by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich
[22:16] <ajmitch> fmarier: and you'll sell it for $100k?
[22:18] <fmarier> ajmitch: i haven't looked at the limit for app purchases, but yeah. this will be a free-as-in-speech but not free-as-in-beer app ;)
[22:18] <fmarier> if i've got time, i also want to improve on the original one by adding in-app payments
[22:19] <fmarier> if you click on the ruby, it makes it bigger each time but at a cost of $x
[22:19]  * fmarier has his retirement plan all sorted
[22:20] <ajmitch> for extra $, you could add some animations to the ruby once it's full-sized
[22:21] <fmarier> good idea
[22:21] <ibeardslee> upgrade from a ruby to a more expensive gem?
[22:22] <fmarier> there are so many opportunities here, i should go full-time on this
[22:23]  * ibeardslee saves the logs to ensure he gets appropriate compensation if the ideas are implemented
[22:24] <fmarier> ibeardslee: i'll give you a free copy of the app, don't worry, i'm a generous guy :D
[22:25] <ibeardslee> heh
[22:27] <ajmitch> next thing you know, you'll be partying with kim dotcom
[22:32] <fmarier> ajmitch: haha, can't wait for my coatsville invite
[22:55] <snail> fmarier: we need an "I am Open Source" which helps people build their own apps...
[23:04] <chilts> fmarier: a very worthy app you are doing :)
[23:04] <chilts> however, I might not pay $999.99 for it
[23:33] <ibeardslee> damnit, firefox won't install onto my old, cheap and nasty ideos phone
