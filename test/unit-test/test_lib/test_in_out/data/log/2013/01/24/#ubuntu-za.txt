[04:18]  * Kilos waves
[05:04]  * Squirm looks at Kilos bleary eyed
[05:07] <Kilos> lol
[05:07] <Kilos> i gotta be early or i get called sleepyhead
[05:08] <Kilos> with stink feet nogal
[05:08] <Kilos> hehe
[05:08] <Kilos> wb inetpro 
[05:08] <Kilos> what crashed
[05:13] <Kilos> the core?
[06:07] <magespawn> morning all
[06:07] <magespawn> hey Kilos
[06:07] <Kilos> howdy magespawn 
[06:07] <nlsthzn> good morning
[06:08] <magespawn> hey nlsthzn
[06:08] <nlsthzn> how are you magespawn ?
[06:08] <Kilos> just an idea. at the hotel. if you plugin one cable at a time wont the faulty one crash it immediately
[06:08] <Kilos> hi nlsthzn 
[06:08] <nlsthzn> alo uncle Kilos 
[06:09] <Kilos> that should isolate it, not so?
[06:10] <superfly> GOOD MORNING PEOPLE
[06:10] <superfly> I NEED HELP!
[06:10] <nlsthzn> GOOD MORNING superfly 
[06:10] <superfly> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS UBUNTU THING IS
[06:10] <superfly> :-P
[06:10] <nlsthzn> WHY ARE WE TALKING RUSSIAN WITH EACH OTHER
[06:11] <superfly> Just checking that everyone is awake :-)
[06:11] <magespawn> good and yourself nlsthzn?
[06:11] <Kilos> lol
[06:11] <Kilos> hiya superfly you fulla beans today
[06:12] <nlsthzn> got up so I can go for a sleep in a bit for night shift. so I am good
[06:12]  * superfly has been hacking portals and deploying resonators
[06:12] <Kilos> tummy better nlsthzn ?
[06:12]  * nlsthzn likes it when apps just work like they should
[06:12] <magespawn> it might Kilos if the cable is faulty, but it was affecting the entire network so has to be a link to the servers or the switch or some other central part of the network
[06:12] <nlsthzn> Kilos, yes thanks uncle Kilos ... toughted it out and seems ok now
[06:13] <nlsthzn> superfly, i thought about it but that would mean getting dressed and going out the house
[06:13] <Kilos> the fly is really hooked on that game
[06:13] <Kilos> hehe
[06:14] <nlsthzn> the idea sounds awesome...
[06:14] <nlsthzn> real life mmorpg almost
[06:15] <superfly> yeah
[06:15] <superfly> will try to go down to that one portal and maybe deploy some more resontators
[06:16] <nlsthzn> curse my laziness...
[06:16] <nlsthzn> *yawn*
[06:17] <Kilos> magespawn, are the cables not connected on the other side to pcs or something
[06:17] <Kilos> you see my reasoning
[06:17] <magespawn> yes they are
[06:17] <Kilos> might be whats plugged in at the other end
[06:18] <magespawn> yes that is what i am thinking to because i know have them running through a slighlity different physical port for the internet
[06:18] <magespawn> s/to/too
[06:19] <Kilos> maybe a linux pc revolting at having to slum all day
[06:19] <magespawn> the packet loss seems to happens on the port that they use for the internet on the replacement router they sent down
[06:19] <magespawn> lol
[06:19] <Kilos> maybe router?
[06:20] <magespawn> yes but just the one port on the router
[06:20] <magespawn> will have to test it to make sure
[06:20] <Kilos> whew
[06:26] <magespawn> brb
[06:31] <Symmetria> my god... I worked on a windows 8 system for all of 60 seconds yesterday
[06:31] <Symmetria> and decided that I'd rather be raped by a rabid goat than have to use that any longer
[06:31] <Symmetria> its *HORRIBLE*
[06:38] <nlsthzn> Symmetria, you can make it better
[06:39] <nlsthzn> just stay away from the modern interface
[06:39] <nlsthzn> if you don't have a touch device...
[06:39] <Symmetria> nlsthzn you can make it go back to having a start bar and all the normal hot keys to avoid complete mouse dependance?
[06:39] <nlsthzn> yup
[06:39] <Symmetria> ;p when I cant hit control-escape on a windows box I wanna break things
[06:39] <nlsthzn> i bought start8 
[06:39] <nlsthzn> works brilliantly
[06:40] <nlsthzn> thus far this desktopis been stupid stable and I have been hitting it with many random applications at the same time for days on end...
[06:42] <Symmetria> heh, my windoze 7 box is awesomely stable
[06:42] <nlsthzn> i guess mine was too now that I think of it
[06:43] <nlsthzn> good thing the "upgrade" was cheap
[06:53] <Symmetria> lol I love some of the network vendor discussions
[06:53] <Symmetria> someone whined that he was getting raped by cisco on price 
[06:54] <Symmetria> I told him I long ago realized, no matter which network vendor you deal with, eventually they are going to rape you, the only difference between them is the quality of the lube used by different vendors
[06:54] <Symmetria> ;p
[07:06] <magespawn> back
[07:07] <Kilos> wb
[07:07] <magespawn> gotta go again
[07:07] <magespawn> bbl
[07:08] <Kilos> hehe
[07:15] <magespawn> and here ia m
[07:15] <Kilos> that was quick
[07:15] <Kilos> hi henkj jrgns 
[07:17] <magespawn> i took after nine to mean anytime after nine, apprently 09:16 is not after nine
[07:17] <Vince-0> hiho
[07:17] <Kilos> lol 
[07:17] <magespawn> hey Vince-0
[07:17] <Kilos> hi Vince-0 
[07:19] <henkj> morning
[07:19] <magespawn> morning henkj
[07:22] <Vince-0> work work
[07:22] <Vince-0> working for the weekend
[07:25] <Symmetria> hrm
[07:25] <Symmetria> 100G is finally cheaper on a gigabit for gigabit basis than 10G 
[08:04]  * nlsthzn starts a budget using ynab
[09:28] <inetpro> Symmetria: now please explain that to me
[09:29] <Kilos> hi inetpro what happened last night?
[09:29] <Symmetria> heh inetpro well
[09:30] <Symmetria> we calculated that a 10G interface
[09:30] <Symmetria> with optic
[09:30] <Symmetria> costs around 6 thousand dollars in a router 
[09:30] <Symmetria> versus a 100gig interface that costs around 39 thousand dollars 
[09:30] <inetpro> interesting
[09:30] <Symmetria> so you are now running at 390 dollars per gigabit on 100G, versus 600 on gigE 
[09:30] <Symmetria> oops on 10GE
[09:31] <Symmetria> gigE is harder to calculate because of density issues
[09:31] <Symmetria> but I'd put gigE very close to 10GE (around the 600 dollar mark)
[09:31] <Symmetria> that does change very drastically if you start introducing the differences between singlemode, multimode and copper cabling though
[09:32] <Symmetria> gigE has copper options, thats a helluva lot cheaper
[09:32] <Symmetria> multimode 100G is at about 39 grand a port, single mode 100G on standard LR optics goes *WAY* up 
[09:33] <Symmetria> (you're looking at around a 25 thousand dollar per port increase)
[09:33] <inetpro> Symmetria: $390 per Gb on 10Gb? That sounds a bit much for me
[09:33] <Symmetria> inetpro $390 per Gb on 100G 
[09:33] <Symmetria> closer to $600 per Gb on 10G
[09:33] <Symmetria> heh, router interfaces arent cheap :) 
[09:33] <inetpro> yikes
[09:33] <inetpro> even worse?
[09:34] <Symmetria> heh like I said, it comes down to the fiber stuff
[09:34] <inetpro> Symmetria: is that the installation costs?
[09:34] <Symmetria> inetpro yeah
[09:34] <inetpro> ahh
[09:34] <Symmetria> the multimode fiber interfaces for example
[09:34] <inetpro> makes sense
[09:34] <Symmetria> cost like, $1000 each you can get em at 
[09:34] <Symmetria> for 10G
[09:34] <Symmetria> versus like, $3k for single mode
[09:34] <Symmetria> so 2k differential
[09:35] <Symmetria> where as on 100G, you're looking at around $2k for 10G multimode
[09:35] <Symmetria> versus $27k for single mode 
[09:35] <Symmetria> so 25 thousand dollar difference there 
[09:35] <Symmetria> that changes the calculations 
[09:35] <Symmetria> lol, and if you start talking extra-long range (40KM optics) things get truely screwed up 
[09:35] <Symmetria> you're looking at $5k for 10G single mode 40Km optic
[09:36] <Symmetria> versus $75k for 100G single mode 40Km optic
[09:36] <Symmetria> ;p
[09:36] <inetpro> Symmetria: so hopefully others will join you and roll out a few more 100Gb networks and let the costs come down some more for everyone else
[09:37] <inetpro> Kilos: good morning
[09:37] <inetpro> Kilos: we had hardware issues
[09:38] <Kilos> morning inetpro we kinda missed you
[09:38] <Kilos> youre core is at work and you connect through that
[09:38]  * inetpro after coming home from school parents meeting last night had to rush through to go resolve matters
[09:39] <Kilos> ai!
[09:39] <Kilos> what crashed?
[09:40] <Kilos> issues is such a broad way of saying things
[09:40] <Kilos> starting at pta electrical suppliers pulled the plug
[09:41] <inetpro> Kilos: memory failure causing our firewall to reboot every few secs
[09:43] <Kilos> ai
[09:43] <Kilos> ty
[09:43] <Kilos> but good to know you fixed it
[09:43] <Kilos> wb
[09:44]  * inetpro still living on the edge, trying to fix the plane in flight
[09:45] <inetpro> hoping that it won't come crashing down again

[09:59]  * Symmetria snickers
[10:03] <Kilos> Symmetria, whats news with a host for us?

[10:05] <Symmetria> ;p
[10:05] <Symmetria> so now remind me ;p
[10:05] <Kilos> bloem varsity?
[10:05] <Kilos> ok we hear what Louis says otherwise ill remind you daily ok?
[10:06] <Kilos> if he says yes you wont be nagged
[10:06] <Symmetria> nono, I meant, remind me the details of what you need on the host
[10:06] <Symmetria> and what we're using it again for 
[10:06] <Symmetria> ;p
[10:06] <Kilos> lol oh
[10:07] <Kilos> we need a host for debdelta which saves up to 80% on updating/upgrading
[10:08] <Kilos> i think this explains
[10:08] <Kilos> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDebdeltaSupport
[10:08] <Kilos> or this
[10:08] <Symmetria> Louis said, fine, they will do it, you gotta email Fanie ;p will get his email address for you in a second
[10:08] <Kilos> http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/man1/debdelta-upgrade.1.html
[10:08] <Kilos> great thank him from me and ubuntu-za
[10:08] <Symmetria> riekertsjpk@ufs.ac.za 
[10:09] <Symmetria> email that 
[10:09] <Symmetria> and tell him myself and Louis sent  you
[10:09] <Symmetria> and cc me aa@alstonnetworks.net
[10:09] <Kilos> what must i say in my mail
[10:09] <Kilos> ?
[10:10] <Kilos> tumbleweed, superfly can you guys advise me please
[10:12] <superfly> Kilos: say that you spoke to Andrew Alston and Louis about running a DebDelta server, and that they sent you to him.
[10:12] <Kilos> yessir superfly but surely i need to give size etc
[10:12] <Symmetria> kilos "hai, we need a debdelta server, here is the documentation about how to set it up" or something to that effect
[10:12] <Symmetria> and say you spoke to me 
[10:12] <superfly> Kilos: ^^ what Symmetria said
[10:12] <Kilos> lol
[10:13] <Kilos> ok Symmetria for the documentation i give links?
[10:13] <Symmetria> (and tell him if he doesn't do it, I'll convince his boss that implementing kerberos on all his servers is critical and has to be done in a week) ;p 
[10:13] <Symmetria> just kidding on that last part
[10:13] <Kilos> lol
[10:14] <Kilos> who will set it up?
[10:14] <Kilos> them?
[10:14] <Symmetria> Fanie will 
[10:14] <Symmetria> he's standing behind me
[10:14] <Symmetria> threatening to shoot me
[10:14] <Symmetria> and then claim the reward
[10:14] <Symmetria> ;p
[10:14] <Kilos> lol
[10:20] <magespawn> is there a way to prove where an email came from using the headers, conclusively?
[10:23] <Symmetria> not really 
[10:25] <magespawn> i have a web developer and host claiming the a person computer is sending spam
[10:25] <magespawn> the spam report is for the ip address of the person website and email hosting
[10:25] <Kilos> hey Symmetria get Fanie to come online here once he has the mail. so some of the clever guys can help me
[10:26] <Kilos> superfly, can i bug you for a good link to debdelta for my mail please
[10:27] <Kilos> i get all doff ones
[10:27] <Kilos> google aint my friend as you all know
[10:27] <Kilos> inetpro, lees man
[10:31] <inetpro> Kilos: sorry, I will need a holiday when I'm done here
[10:32] <Kilos> ai
[10:32] <inetpro> somewhere on a remote island for a year without mobile or interwebs connectivity
[10:33] <Kilos> lol
[11:10] <Kilos> hey guys must this deb-delta server be a mirror?
[11:27] <Kilos> Symmetria, install xchat for Fanie so he can come here
[11:27] <Kilos> ive mailed him
[11:28] <Kilos> but im sure he can get better info from the guys here than me
[11:36] <Kilos> i forgot to cc to you Symmetria 
[11:39] <Kilos> mm forwarded twice
[11:39] <Kilos> sigh
[12:26] <Symmetria> haha kilos fanie is quite capable of installing xchat if he wants to :) 
[12:26] <Kilos> lol
[12:40] <Kilos> i shoulda gone via our mailing list somehow then everyone can get involved
[13:37]  * Squirm stretches
[13:37] <Squirm> 50min left
[13:46] <Kilos> then home?
[14:13] <Kilos> wen jy inetpro ?
[14:13] <inetpro> Kilos: as dit nie so warm was nie was dit dalk makliker
[14:14] <Kilos> ai
[14:14] <magespawn>  i am out of here for now
[14:15] <inetpro> Kilos: en dan praat ek nie eens van die onderbrekings in 'n normale werksdag nie
[14:15] <Kilos> later then magespawn 
[14:15] <inetpro> so ons loop maar op genade
[14:15] <Kilos> ai jaag weg die mense man
[14:16] <Kilos> "can't you see I'm Busy"
[14:16] <Kilos> BUSY
[14:16] <inetpro> Kilos: can't you see I'm busy?

=== Trix[a]r_za is now known as Trixar_za
[15:20] <Kilos> hi Trixar_za 
[15:20] <Kilos> long time no see
[15:22] <Trixar_za> Yeah, been busy with stuff :P
[15:22] <Kilos> funny this thing stuff
[15:22] <Trixar_za> Anybody know a Cape Town based Red Hat Training center?
[15:22] <Kilos> gets everyone sooner or later
[15:22] <Trixar_za> All the good ones seems to be Johannesburg
[15:23] <Kilos> ai
[15:23] <Kilos> you want to go on a course?
[15:23] <Kilos> why not do it like nuvolari 
[15:24] <Trixar_za> How did he do it?
[15:24] <Kilos> i thing correspondence
[15:24] <Kilos> Squirm, \
[15:25] <Kilos> not nuvolari 
[15:25] <Kilos> sorry. head no happy
[15:25] <Trixar_za> He did it by flying there, staying with family close to the center, taking the 4 day course and flying back
[15:26] <Kilos> oh my
[15:26] <Trixar_za> Then he flies up in 2 months to take the exam
[15:26] <Kilos> eeek
[15:26] <Trixar_za> I want to fast track (and possibly make life hard for myself) by running the RH300 course - the combined RHCSA and RHCE course
[15:28] <Trixar_za> Damn
[15:28] <Trixar_za> Now they have the Upcon convention up there too
[15:29] <Trixar_za> Well, in Pretoria, but close enough
[15:35] <Kilos> long way to go
[15:39] <Squirm> Trixar_za: I'm lucky I don't have to fly. you forget where I live :P
[15:39] <Squirm> 3.5hour drive
[15:39] <Trixar_za> Oh right
[15:39] <Trixar_za> lol
[15:39] <Squirm> bbl, supper time
[15:39] <Trixar_za> It's a 16-18 hour drive for me :P
[15:40] <Squirm> Trixar_za: remember, to get RHCE you need RHCSA
[15:40] <Squirm> oh yes, *gone
[15:40] <Trixar_za> Not if you run RH300
[15:40] <Trixar_za> :P
[15:41] <Trixar_za> Only you don't spend much time going through both courses material
[15:41] <Trixar_za> Which is bad :/
[15:59] <Kilos> ka shisa kusasa 18°c and 38°c
[16:02] <charl_> good afternoon

[16:14] <charl_> Kilos: good thanks
=== Trixar_za is now known as Trix[a]r_za
[16:15] <Kilos> hi not_found 
[16:15] <not_found> hiya uncle Kilos 
[16:15] <Kilos> at long last it looks like we getting ahead with hosting for a deb-delta server
[16:16] <Kilos> can save lotsa data and have quicker update/upgrades
[16:16] <Kilos> maybe then i can have a go at a daily build ubuntu
[16:17] <not_found> how does that work... does it automagically on the fly calculate what is needed and then download it and what about creating the file to be installed, is that done on the host or server?
[16:18] <Kilos> i think the server does the work and only supplies what has been changed
[16:18] <Kilos> not full packages
[16:18] <Kilos> and your pc shows what it has got
[16:18] <Kilos> been a while since i read up on it
[16:18] <Kilos> back in lucid days methinks
[16:19] <Kilos> but now deb-delta is in the repos
[16:19] <not_found> cool... rpm has been doing this for ages
[16:19] <Kilos> back then it was debian
[16:22] <Kilos> save up to 80% data
[16:22] <Kilos> and save lotsa upgrade time
[16:22] <not_found> SA must get with the program and stop being so expensive for data... will fix many issues 
[16:24] <Kilos> lol
[16:24] <Kilos> this should be a fast server methinks
[16:24] <Kilos> bloem varsity
[16:28] <Kilos> if its slow we jump on Symmetria 
[16:28] <Kilos> hehe
[16:29] <not_found> :)
[16:48]  * Squirm yawns
[16:50]  * Squirm goes to play a little dota
[16:50] <Squirm> they must port it to linux already :/
[16:50] <not_found> Squirm: dota on WC3?
[16:51] <Squirm> not_found: dota2
[16:51] <Squirm> Steam
[16:51] <not_found> ah cool... was going to ask if you want a dota 2 invite :p
[16:51] <Squirm> I got an email from Steam a few days ago saying I have Dota 2 invites. I now have 13
[16:51] <Squirm> got another email from them yesterday, another 4
[16:51]  * not_found does the dota 2 thing every now and again
[16:52] <not_found> oh wow... I think I have 6
[16:52] <Squirm> and I don't know anyone else who plays dota
[16:52] <Squirm> (I only got dota2 2 weeks ago)
[16:52] <not_found> but I am playing smite a whole lot more than dota 2 currently
[16:52] <not_found> I have had it several months :/ silly steam :p
[16:52] <Squirm> I got all excited and downloaded steam for linux, turns out Dota 2 doesn't work :/
[16:52] <Squirm> along with 99% of the other games
[16:52] <not_found> yup
[16:53] <not_found> it hasn't been ported (yet)
[16:53] <not_found> but valve very anti windows 8 so I am pretty sure it will come soon
[16:53] <Squirm> I think it's popular enough to do it now
[16:53] <not_found> then again it was running fairly well in wine
[16:53] <Squirm> never worked for me
[16:53] <not_found> just some glitches with text etc.
[16:54] <not_found> I used crossover if memory serves
[16:54] <Squirm> ok
[16:54] <Squirm> not opensource
[16:55] <Squirm> not_found: do you have any idea how a 2Gb notebook gfx compares to a 2Gb PCI-e ?
[16:56] <Squirm> I want a laptop but it was be enough to play the very few games I play
[16:56] <Squirm> s/was/must/
[16:58] <not_found> Squirm: use http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/ to compare the GPU's... typically the GPU's in notebooks have an M appended to the end... will give you an idea of how they compare
[16:59] <not_found> top of the range gfx cards pull more power than a whole laptop so you can imagine the performance difference :p
[17:01] <Squirm> I don't want anywhere near top of the range
[17:01] <Squirm> it must play some CoD, CSS, Dota 2
[17:03] <not_found> then most of the current 1 or 2gb mobile ones will work ok... just keep in mind if you want to go linux that the hybrid graphics are is still pretty patchy
[17:03] <Squirm> I'd dualboot
[17:03] <not_found> +1
[17:04] <not_found> for myself I need a desktop... must have a desktop... must have the graphics set up to 11... 
[17:04] <Squirm> not_found: I'd like a desktop. but I don't know. getting tired of moving it around and stuff
[17:05] <not_found> that is why I don't :p
[17:06] <Squirm> maybe I should compare
[17:06] <Squirm> Core i5, 4Gb RAM, 24Gb SSD + 500Gb HDD, 2Gb DDR3 GT 635M
[17:06] <Squirm> R8500
[17:06] <not_found> nice gfx card
[17:06] <Squirm> it's 1x4Gb RAM, so I can bump that up at some point
[17:07] <Squirm> and I'd have to bump up my hdd if I'm dual booting
[17:07] <not_found> i7 2600 8GB RAM 500GB+350GB HDD 1GB AMD Radeon 6850 
[17:07] <Squirm> leave linux on the SSD
[17:07] <not_found> (gfx card weaklink)
[17:08] <Squirm> meh, and
[17:08] <Squirm> my pc
[17:08] <Squirm> Dual Core 2Ghz, 4Gb RAM, 2x1TB hdd, 1Gb Radeon HD 4200
[17:09] <Squirm> hmm, could be 2Gb gfx, but it was hit by lightning. stuff doesn't render correctly
[17:09] <not_found> :) seems your notebook more than enough for your needs... just see if you can get more RAM sometime
[17:09] <Squirm> yeah, I'd bump it up. try buy 2x8Gb :P
[17:10] <not_found> ooh... nice :D
[17:11] <Squirm> I like the fact that it has an SSD, means there are 2 hdd bays
[17:11] <Vince-0> I have the old school i7 3ghz + Geforce 560ti. 4-8GB ram only affects loading time in battlefield for example
[17:11] <Squirm> and that my OS will boot nicely(I don't play many games, so it'll be for linux)
[17:12] <Squirm> and if I have space, windows

[17:12] <Vince-0> hi
[17:12] <Squirm> hi
[17:12] <SmilyBorg> Hey there
[17:13]  * not_found goes for dinner bbl
[17:14] <Squirm> lol, not_found, that mobile gfx is ranked better than my current pci card
[17:15] <Squirm> now I want that laptop
[17:18] <Kilos> hi SmilyBorg 
[17:30] <Squirm> Maaz: tell not_found - Just put together a PC with prices. like R700 more than the laptop but quite nice :/ Core i7 3.5GHz Ivy Bridge, 16Gb Kingston HyperX RAM, 3Tb HDD, 2Gb GDDR5 Innovision GeForce 660
[17:30] <Maaz> Squirm: Sure, I'll tell not_found on freenode
[17:50] <not_found> Squirm: that is an awesome desktop... 
[17:52]  * Squirm grumbles
[17:52] <Squirm> R9500 though
[17:52] <Squirm> :(
[17:52] <not_found> problem when you go for top end...
[17:53] <not_found> but it seems a decent price for what you are getting
[17:53] <Squirm> wholesale price
[17:54] <not_found> ah
[18:37]  * not_found is considering National Diploma: Engineering: Chemical (NDENG) ... anyone have any experience with the practical components of this (as I will need to come to SA to do those)...
[18:38] <Kilos> whew thats serious stuff not_found 
[18:38] <Kilos> inetpro, wen jy darem?
[18:39] <inetpro> Kilos: ek lewe nog
[18:39] <Kilos> en die probleme. is dit reg nou?
[18:40] <not_found> I have to try uncle Kilos ... I have hit the ceiling (or a brick wall) and the only way up and out is with some heavy papers
[18:40] <Kilos> good not_found . i like your attitude
[18:40] <inetpro> Kilos: ons loop op genade
[18:40] <Kilos> nog steeds inetpro wats fout
[18:41] <inetpro> Kilos: ek's moeg
[18:41] <Kilos> nee man met die probleme
[18:41] <inetpro> Kilos: dit ook
[18:41] <Kilos> jy moet vroeg gaan slaap ne
[18:42] <inetpro> Kilos: die goed loop al van gisteraand af, maar kan enige tyd weer omval
[18:42] <Kilos> wat is die probleem?
[18:42]  * inetpro is besig om nuwe hardware aan die gang te kry en alles oor te skakel
[18:42] <Kilos> is dit die nuwe hardeware wat probleme geee
[18:43] <Kilos> of die conf stuff
[18:43] <Kilos> hehe
[18:43] <Kilos> o

[18:44] <Kilos> hi smile
[18:44] <Kilos> Guest88350, ?
[18:44] <Guest88350> hi
[18:45] <Guest88350> i'm too slow
[18:45] <Guest88350> :p
[18:45] <Kilos> what happened Guest88350 
[18:45] <Kilos> too slow?
[18:45] <Guest88350> broke my little finger
[18:45] <Kilos> lol
[18:45] <Kilos> how
[18:47] <Guest88350> gym
[18:47] <Guest88350> basketball
=== Guest88350 is now known as smileee
[18:47] <Kilos> hi theblazehen 
[18:47] <not_found> smileee: ouch
[18:48] <Kilos> didnt you know it hurts smileee 
[18:48] <Kilos> live and learn
[18:48] <smileee> lol
[18:48] <smileee> basketball landed onto my finger
[18:49] <Kilos> ouch
[18:49] <not_found> now if it was a bowling ball >.<
[18:49] <Kilos> lol
[18:49] <smileee> ><
[18:51] <Kilos> not_found, how long are the classes
[18:51] <Kilos> years?
[18:51] <not_found> oh, diploma is 3 years but I doubt that is do-able part time...
[18:52] <not_found> the biggest issue is there are a lot of practical classes and they are only done in SA
[18:52] <Kilos> not if you plays games as well
[18:52] <Kilos> you gonna move back or what?
[18:52] <not_found> games are not the issue... the fact that I am at work so often is kind of a limiting factor
[18:53] <Kilos> doesnt unisa do it
[18:53] <Kilos> what you call it when you get study material from the net
[18:54] <Kilos> i hope Squirm is seeing this
[18:55] <Kilos> study while you can
[18:55] <not_found> distance learning
[18:55] <not_found> that is the plan... and if the practical is done over say two or three weeks back to back I can come over on leave and do them
[18:55] <Kilos> no man there is a name for it
[18:55] <Kilos> correspondance courses
[18:56] <Kilos> something like that
[18:56] <Kilos> whew good luck lad
[18:57] <not_found> problem is unisa... not the best at communicating
[18:57] <not_found> I can't find any info on the practical side as they don't do it but outsource it...
[18:57] <Kilos> ah
[18:58] <Kilos> what does google say
[18:58] <not_found> haha... africa is a big black hole for google
[18:58] <Kilos> http://www.ehow.com/list_6745396_correspondence-courses-mechanical-engineering.html
[18:59] <Squirm> not_found: what course are you looking at studying?
[18:59] <not_found> chemical engeineering
[18:59] <Kilos> ai
[18:59] <Squirm> ouch
[19:02] <Kilos> http://aiu.edu/Bachelor%20of%20Chemical%20Engineering.html
[19:02]  * not_found will look in a bit... actually have to do something for a change
[19:03] <Kilos> hehe
[19:11] <not_found> not trusting the link... there are too many fake things on the internet
[19:19] <Squirm> goodnight all
[19:24] <not_found> good night Squirm 
[19:31] <smileee> bye
[19:31] <smileee> :)
[19:38] <Kilos> night all. sleep tight
