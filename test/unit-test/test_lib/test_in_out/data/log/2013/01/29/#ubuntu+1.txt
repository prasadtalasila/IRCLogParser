[17:00] <Walther> Hello folks! It seems an update has broken my compiz - I can't switch between virtual desktops at all.
[17:05] <jbicha> Walther: try System Settings>Appearance>Behavior to reactive workspaces
[17:06] <Walther> jbicha: weird, was it *disabled by default* in some update?
[17:07] <jbicha> yes, bug 868423
[17:07] <ubottu> bug 868423 in unity (Ubuntu) "Launcher - Workspace switcher should not be in the Launcher by default" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/868423
[17:07] <Walther> huh? O_o
[17:08] <Walther> ...quite a major feature to be removed, in my opinion
[17:12] <Walther> So, did I get it right - from 13.04 onwards, no workspaces by default?
[17:13] <jbicha> yes but there's an easy button to add it back for those that use that feature (most people don't)
[17:13] <Walther> Wow. I kinda can understand the reasoning behind it, but I'm also pretty sure this will invoke *big* flamewars among the less tolerant
[17:14] <Walther> multiple workspaces/desktops has always been a major selling point in linuxes for me, compared to windows. Of course, nto the biggest nor the only one
[17:15] <jbicha> it's that the biggest thing people are flaming us for, I'm happy ;)
[17:15] <Walther> hehe
[17:16] <Walther> But yeah- I can't survive with only 4 desktops either - I always add 3x3 from ccsm :P
[17:16] <Walther> But yeah, I don't like alt-tabbing
[17:41] <MikeRL> Hmm.... I've reported a bug here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/1102660 but the problem is I'm not sure if the bug relates to the kernel or Xorg.
[17:41] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1102660 in xorg (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu Raring Hard Freezes with AMD Driver" [Undecided,New]
[17:41] <MikeRL> Is there anyone that can make sense of the log filess?
[17:41] <MikeRL> Sorry for crap spelling.
[17:42] <MikeRL> It seems there is no bug supervisor for Xorg, so I figured I should ask to see if I can speed it along by categorizing the bug properly.
[17:42] <MikeRL> On raring, that is.
[17:45] <MikeRL> I know it's in development, yes, but I've used development Ubuntu versions before (I have two computers, so might as well use one to hunt bugs). But I haven't had the misfortune of having it tank on me without an error before, so I may need some guidance directing the bug to the right people.

[19:54] <AlanBell> hi all
[19:54] <AlanBell> is today a good day to upgrade to raring?
[19:57] <jbicha> AlanBell: probably, I upgraded a computer this weekend and it was fine, the -proposed staging really helps installability
[19:58]  * AlanBell hits the button
[19:59] <AlanBell> huh, it didn't disable PPAs and rolled back
[20:01] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone here able to play mp3 streams in Rhythmbox? I can only get ogg to work...  works in VLC though so I know the stream is good.
[20:01] <FunnyLookinHat> This is what I'm trying: http://audio.misproductions.com:9030
[20:04] <jbicha> AlanBell: weird, I used sudo do-release-upgrade -d but update-manager should work too
[20:07] <AlanBell> I removed them from sources.list.d and it is going fine now
[20:08] <AlanBell> 1622MB to download, 22 minutes on your connection \o/
[20:22] <IdleOne> AlanBell: i got you beat
[20:22] <IdleOne> 1,014 M. This download will take
[20:22] <IdleOne> about 14 minutes with your connection
[20:27] <AlanBell> I should have plugged into a wired connection :)
[21:15]  * AlanBell is on raring
[21:17] <jrgifford> AlanBell: welcome to the club!
[21:18] <AlanBell> terminal is a bit see through, but other than that it all works as before
[21:18] <AlanBell> some corruption in the gnome-shell overview mode
[21:19] <jrgifford> yeah, i kind of like the new terminal option.
[21:23] <IdleOne> time for a reboot.
[21:27] <IdleOne> WOW! The login screen is beautiful on kubuntu
[21:41] <BluesKaj> it's cool looking and about time too , IdleOne :)
[21:47] <yofel_> it's almost beautiful, we need to do something about the background rendering. It's different from ksplashx and looks a bit choppy (missing antialiasing or so)
[22:29] <TLoT> when's feature freeze?
[22:30] <yofel_> !schedule
[22:30] <ubottu> Raring Ringtail (13.04) release milestones can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule
[22:31] <yofel_> March 7th
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[22:37] <TLoT> yofel: when's the final date for debian syncs to universe for raring to be processed?  feature freeze?
[22:38] <yofel> DebianImportFreeze is the end of the automatic syncs, after that you can request syncs yourself which will be processed until feature freeze
[22:39] <yofel> (or till final freeze if you can get a freeze exception)
[22:40] <TLoT> its a manual sync (from Experimental) hence my just needing the final date.
[22:40] <TLoT> thanks :)
[22:40]  * TLoT is a tad annoyed at Debian that sid's partially frozen :P
[22:41] <yofel> well, even they need a feature freeze sometimes ^^
[22:42] <TLoT> speaking of debian (and I know its partly offtopic), did they release yet?
[22:43] <yofel> not that I know of
[22:48] <lunarjar> Hi, I'm planning to move to 13.04. Can I use the daily and the just will have to update through repos, or will I have to rsync a new daily everytime I want to update?
[22:49] <yofel> you can just update using the repository after installing 13.04
[22:49] <lunarjar> oh cool
[22:49] <lunarjar> I heard 13.04 is quite stable right? For daily use?
[22:49] <yofel> I can only talk about Kubuntu, which is usable
[23:18] <FernandoMiguel> (29-01-2013 23:17:06) QuLogic: does ubuntu 13 use gtk3 yet?
[23:18] <FernandoMiguel> anyone knows?
[23:24] <TheLordOfTime> FernandoMiguel, as an aside, you may want to refrain from cross-posting across channels ;)
[23:24] <FernandoMiguel> TheLordOfTime: I'm aware of it.. and I do avoid it
[23:24] <FernandoMiguel> I don't like it either
[23:25] <TheLordOfTime> FernandoMiguel, when you ask a question you may have to wait 10, 20, sometimes 40 minutes to get an answer.  usually answers are fast
[23:25] <TheLordOfTime> unless nobody knows
[23:25] <TheLordOfTime> in which case you wait
[23:25] <FernandoMiguel> and waiting I am
[23:58] <FernandoMiguel> which is the package for gconftool-2 ?
