[02:33] <qkall> greets - im trying to figure out how to set my volume buttons to activate some command to change the volume as they dont seem to work by default but i cant seem to google anytni g relevant
[02:40] <qkall> nevermind! found a good link
[04:24] <genoobie> hey all
[04:24] <genoobie> I just finished installing lubuntu
[04:24] <genoobie> but the video is messed up
[04:25] <genoobie> I'm at the login screen if I hit ctrl+alt+f1
[04:25] <genoobie> I get a login window that's OK
[04:25] <genoobie> not sure how to proceed.
[04:38] <holstein> genoobie: i would either install a driver, assuming there is one...
[04:38] <holstein> !ati
[04:38] <ubottu> For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto
[04:38] <holstein> or, try the vesa driver..
[04:38] <holstein> try nomodeset
[04:41] <holstein> http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1997290.html is relevant
[04:42] <genoobie> it's an S3 / Savage
[04:43] <genoobie> the login screen looks like this....http://postimage.org/image/76g39fvnl/7648fc50/
[04:43] <holstein> genoobie: depends on the graphics hardware.. but it sounds like your graphics card is not supported well
[04:44] <holstein> genoobie: try the nomodset option as mentioned above, from the live CD
[04:44] <genoobie> holstein, I don't have the liveCD...
[04:44] <holstein> genoobie: if that works, then you know that you can use the vesa driver via a custom xorg.conf, or make that nomodset option stick
[04:44] <genoobie> holstein, I did an install of xubuntu 12.10 a while ago and that worked...
[04:44] <holstein> genoobie: theres a recovery kernel options
[04:45] <genoobie> holstein, there is some configuration that obviously must work...
[04:45] <genoobie> urgh
[04:45] <genoobie> okay so if I lspci -v
[04:46] <genoobie> it's using savagefb
[04:46] <holstein> it?
[04:47] <holstein> genoobie: when i have had issues that give images such as you posted, i have used the vesa driver
[04:47] <genoobie> holstein, I know there is a driver that works...
[04:48] <genoobie> with kernel 3.x
[04:48] <holstein> genoobie: the vesa driver will work
[04:49] <genoobie> holstein, of that I am sure
[04:49] <holstein> genoobie: then, whats the problem?
[04:49] <holstein> genoobie: maybe savagefb is "breaking" support
[04:49] <genoobie> well, the Xorg is a better driver, no?
[04:50] <holstein> genoobie: "better" is a matter of opinion
[04:50] <genoobie> I mean using x11 is going to be "smoother" / less hiccups so to speak
[04:50] <holstein> id say, if i had to pick "better" from that pictuer you linked, or vesa, id go vesa
[04:50] <holstein> genoobie: if you have a custom xorg.conf, its literally as easy as editing the driver line to vesa to test
[04:52] <genoobie> okay
[04:52] <genoobie> here's what I propose...
[04:52] <genoobie> I am going to "boot" up a puppylinux that I know "works"
[04:52] <holstein> yeah, and copy the xorg...
[04:52] <holstein> i like that
[04:52] <genoobie> yes
[04:52] <holstein> i use knoppix sometimes like that
[04:52] <genoobie> okay it will take a few, but I'll bb
[04:53] <holstein> then, you have a known good file, and you can swap the driver line out and test
[04:58] <Unit193> You can also diff the two files, see why one works and the other doesn't.
[05:56] <genoobie> holstein, you still here?
[05:57] <Unit193> He went to sleep.
[05:57] <genoobie> Unit193, I recently installed lubuntu
[05:57] <Unit193> xorg.conf work from puppy?
[05:57] <genoobie> yes
[05:58] <genoobie> not sure exactly how to make this work
[05:58] <genoobie> but i am in puppy now
[05:58] <genoobie> so if I pull up a console window in puppy
[05:58] <genoobie> where would I find my xorg.conf
[05:59] <Unit193> /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:59] <genoobie> okay there are a few .conf
[06:00] <genoobie> but the one that is running xorg.conf should be specific to my machine, no?
[06:00] <Unit193> Not used puppy in a while...
[06:01] <genoobie> looking for the driver in xorg.conf...
[06:06] <genoobie> so should I just copy the xorg.conf from puppy to lubuntu?
[06:11] <Unit193> Yep,
[06:25] <genoobie> Unit193, you still here?
[06:25] <Unit193> Yep.
[06:25] <genoobie> okay, I am poking around
[06:25] <genoobie> can't really find the "driver" per se
[06:26] <genoobie> but what I did find was the OpenGL rendered
[06:26] <genoobie> renderer, is that the "same thing"?
[06:26] <Unit193> No.
[06:26] <genoobie> urgh
[06:26] <genoobie> eff
[06:26] <genoobie> so now i am in the tree of lubuntu
[06:27] <genoobie> where is the xorg here?
[06:27] <genoobie> there's no .conf file in the /etc/x11 dir
[06:27] <genoobie> XWrapper?
[06:27] <Unit193> Same place.  I have Identifier, newline, then Driver.
[06:27] <Unit193> There may not be a file.
[06:28] <genoobie> oh, hrm
[06:28] <genoobie> so where is the xorg.conf?
[06:28] <Unit193> You'll have to restart X
[06:28] <Unit193> /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:28] <genoobie> so if I boot back into lubuntu
[06:28] <genoobie> and ctrl+alt+f1
[06:29] <genoobie> restart "X" I should get a .conf file?
[06:30] <Unit193> No, you're supposed to place the one you copied from puppy there, then restart it.
[06:30] <Unit193> !xorgconf
[06:30] <ubottu> The /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is deprecated, but sometimes may still be needed to pass values to specific drivers. Generic xorg.conf generation: http://ubottu.com/y/xorgconf - ATI/AMD ( fglrx driver ) specific: http://ubottu.com/y/atiamd - NVidia ( nvidia driver )specific: http://ubottu.com/y/nvidia man xorg.conf for file structure and syntax.
[06:31] <genoobie> okay, let me try that
[06:34] <genoobie> Unit193, did not work
[06:34] <genoobie> last shot, I will boot xubuntu live and see if I can pull the X info from this...
[06:35] <genoobie> although it seems to take 45 min to load...
[06:46] <genoobie> Unit193, would there be an X log from the install?
[06:47] <Unit193> In /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[06:48] <genoobie> does the dm use graphics differently than the DE / OS?

[14:55] <Guest32263> hello i'm having trouble getting java iced-tea to work properly in lubuntu
[14:56] <Guest32263> when i try to load it, its orginally blocked because its apparently out of date, i have two options "run this time" and "update plug-in"
[14:57] <Guest32263> i believe its already up to date, and when i click "run this time" it usually works, but this time its glitchy, and doesnt display all the text i need to see
[14:57] <Guest32263> i'm doing a calculus quiz for an online class and i can not see the entire equation :(
[14:59] <Guest32263> i can post screenshots if anybody wants
[16:02] <l057c0d3r> anyone use cario dock with lubuntu
[21:10] <genoobie> okay I give up
[21:10] <genoobie> I am trying to isntall lubuntu as the performance is better on low ram than xubuntu
[21:11] <genoobie> however, there are some problems
[21:11] <genoobie> xubuntu loads live just fine and installs OK too
[21:11] <genoobie> lubuntu, not so much
[21:11] <wxl> how so, genoobie ? and what machine?
[21:12] <genoobie> I have a PIII 800MHz, 384MB ram thinkpad laptop
[21:12] <wxl> and what about the first question? "not so much" doesn't offer much to go on.
[21:12] <genoobie> wxl the xubuntu somehow picks out the right driver for the S3, while the lubuntu, not so much
[21:12] <genoobie> okay
[21:12] <genoobie> so x-enviro / vga
[21:13] <wxl> same problem both live and installed? if so, what installation method did you use?
[21:13] <genoobie> yes, same problem both with alternate / desktop
[21:13] <genoobie> which is SO weird because you'd think modprobe etc would be the same for each distro
[21:14] <wxl> you mean you have the same problem in a live environment as you do in both an alternate install and a standard install?
[21:14] <genoobie> yes
[21:14] <genoobie> on lubuntu
[21:14] <genoobie> but xubuntu works
[21:14] <wxl> so have you managed to ascertain which drive xubuntu is using? also, i assume that you're using the same version between the xubuntu and the lubuntu?
[21:14] <genoobie> however, I will say this, the "lubuntu" splash screen with the four white dots does appear normally
[21:15] <genoobie> well 12.04 vs 12.10
[21:15] <genoobie> I think
[21:15] <wxl> so that's a variable you need to eliminate
[21:15] <genoobie> okay, you really think that'd be a likely variable?
[21:15] <wxl> yep
[21:15] <genoobie> what I was hoping was that there'd be some way I could grab the info from xubuntu live boot and jam it into the lubuntu install.
[21:16] <genoobie> okay, I will try 12.04
[21:16] <wxl> welllllllll
[21:16] <wxl> hold on
[21:16] <wxl> which xubuntu and which lubuntu are you using? 12.04 xubuntu and 12.10 lubuntu?
[21:16] <genoobie> yes
[21:16] <wxl> so it may be a regression of some kind
[21:16] <wxl> it has happened
[21:17] <wxl> i'd suggest downloading a live 12.10 xubuntu and see if it also has the curse
[21:17] <genoobie> why not the lubuntu 12.04?
[21:17] <genoobie> are you sure it wouldn't be wiser to boot the 12.04 lubuntu?
[21:18] <wxl> 1 sec
[21:18] <wxl> phone
[21:18] <genoobie> ok
[21:20] <wxl> welll
[21:20] <wxl> i'll tell you honestly my motivation is not only to ensure that you get a functional lubuntu but also to diagnose any bugs we have that might affect other users of either variant
[21:20] <wxl> that being said, i guess technically i care more about lubuntu than xubuntu :)
[21:21] <wxl> so yeah, why don't you get the 12.04 lubuntu a try and see what happens
[21:21] <wxl> if no luck there, then i would be nice to see what drivers are being used in the xubuntu 12.04
[21:21] <genoobie> okay
[21:21] <genoobie> well why not boot that up and see what they are...
[21:21] <wxl> do you know how to do that?
[21:21] <genoobie> I can bring up a terminal window in my lubuntu and log int
[21:22] <wxl> you can use pastebinit if that's helpful to you
[21:22] <genoobie> not sure how to find which drivers are being used per se
[21:22] <wxl> i often do that
[21:22] <genoobie> well the problem is without a gui, I'd be stuck in the "unable" to do :)
[21:22] <genoobie> I couldn't pastebin via cli
[21:22] <wxl> you can
[21:23] <wxl> "pastebinit" is a cli command
[21:23] <genoobie> maybe but I can't
[21:23] <genoobie> oh
[21:23] <genoobie> so if I >> to a file
[21:23] <genoobie> then I can pastebinit?
[21:23] <wxl> e.g. if you did "ls ~ | pastebinit" it would return a url on pastebin that includes the results of ls ~
[21:23] <wxl> or you can do that too but the above eliminates a step
[21:24] <genoobie> so wxl
[21:24] <genoobie> here's the issue
[21:24] <genoobie> what's the best "strategy"
[21:24] <genoobie> boot live 12.04 xubuntu
[21:24] <genoobie> and mount the lubuntu partition
[21:24] <genoobie> extract info and compare?
[21:24] <wxl> well sure you could do that
[21:24] <wxl> but
[21:24] <wxl> er
[21:24] <wxl> no
[21:25] <wxl> i think i personally would boot to both environments separately
[21:25] <genoobie> wxl, okay
[21:25] <wxl> i'd get /var/log/Xorg.0.log for one thing as there may be some telling stuff there
[21:25] <genoobie> let me boot up my lubuntu
[21:25] <wxl> one sec
[21:25] <genoobie> k
[21:26] <wxl> it might be good to get the VGA controller info from e.g. lspci -vv
[21:27] <genoobie> yeah, but then that relies on the database that somehow
[21:27] <genoobie> okay I am in the home dir of the lubuntu install
[21:28] <genoobie> what are the things I should do...
[21:28] <genoobie> definitely post the Xorg log
[21:28] <wxl> well install pastebinit for one
[21:28] <genoobie> not sure how to pastebinit
[21:28] <wxl> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pastebinit
[21:28] <wxl> cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | pastebinit
[21:28] <genoobie> oh crap
[21:28] <wxl> lspci -vv | pastebinit
[21:29] <genoobie> do I okay
[21:29] <genoobie> hold a sec
[21:29] <genoobie> the update may take a few min
[21:30] <wxl> no prob
[21:30] <genoobie> dl pastebinit now
[21:30] <wxl> lsmod | pastebinit
[21:30] <genoobie> is the lsmod after the cat and lspci commands?
[21:30] <wxl> yep
[21:30] <wxl> just trying to get more info
[21:31] <genoobie> there's a .log and a .log.ol
[21:31] <genoobie> there's a .log and a .log.old
[21:31] <genoobie> both?
[21:31] <wxl> no just the most current
[21:31] <genoobie> wxl thank you for showing me pastebinit cli
[21:32] <wxl> np
[21:32] <genoobie> wxl, says trying to send an empty doc
[21:32] <wxl> oh gawd
[21:32] <wxl> not that bug again
[21:33] <genoobie> lspci -vv >> test.out && cat test.out | pastebinit
[21:33] <wxl> oh you don't need to do all that :)
[21:33] <wxl> just lspci -vv | pastebinit
[21:33] <wxl> see if that doesn't work better
[21:33] <genoobie> that says "You are trying to send an empty document, exiting"
[21:33] <wxl> grr
[21:34] <genoobie> will try my way...
[21:34] <genoobie> oky
[21:35] <wxl> did it work?
[21:35] <wxl> if not this may fix you:
[21:35] <wxl> echo -e "<pastebinit>\n\t<pastebin>http://pastebin.com</pastebin>\n</pastebinit>" > .pastebinit.xml
[21:35] <genoobie> ok
[21:36] <genoobie> the three links are http://paste.ubuntu.com/1590824 , http://paste.ubuntu.com/1590833, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1590834
[21:36] <wxl> ok now do it on xubuntu
[21:36] <genoobie> wxl I *really* appreciate your time on this btw
[21:37] <genoobie> well booting the liveCD on this machine is seriously a 25 min operation
[21:37] <wxl> no prob that's why i'm here :)
[21:37] <wxl> i'll be here
[21:37] <genoobie> btw, I have lubuntu running on a dual core
[21:38] <genoobie> on another laptop in my house
[21:38] <genoobie> very happy so far
[21:38] <wxl> i have it on several machines and virtual machines
[21:38] <wxl> it's my fave :)
[21:38] <genoobie> wxl there is one thing to note, the lubuntu exit and enter splash screen both work
[21:38] <wxl> i have some troublesome machines, though. mostly ppcs but i digress…
[21:39] <genoobie> yeah ppc is a tough nut
[21:39] <wxl> (EVERYTHING is troublesome with ppcs)
[21:39] <genoobie> I wish I had the skills to run a *nix on a ppc and solve all this stuff myself
[21:39] <wxl> still i feel some strange moral drive to ensure that lubuntu can install on them. no idea why :)
[21:39] <wxl> genoobie: well we all start somewhere. this is somewhere :)
[21:40] <genoobie> once upon a time I knew a lot more than I know now
[21:40] <genoobie> well my pc goes back to z80 and 8080 days, CP/M etc
[21:40] <wxl> NICE!
[21:41] <wxl> i used CP/M on my first computer (a C=128)
[21:41] <genoobie> was about 10 at the time the "osborne" portable computer arrived
[21:41] <genoobie> what a fiasco, 50 pounds of personal computing.
[21:42] <wxl> :)
[21:42] <genoobie> anyhow, still shakin' it here boss :)
[21:43] <genoobie> bb in 5
[21:43] <wxl> np
[21:43] <wxl> i'm checking out your files
[21:43] <genoobie> the kernel in xubuntu 12.04 is 3.2.0-29
[21:43] <genoobie> I think the lubuntu install is 3.5
[21:43] <genoobie> dunno if that makes a diff
[21:44] <genoobie> stupid s3 graphics card, what a piece of junk
[21:44] <wxl> there is one error here:
[21:44] <wxl> [    26.294] (EE) SAVAGE(0): DRI isn't enabled
[21:44] <genoobie> yes
[21:44] <wxl> not sure that's fatal or not but it may need a tweak to make it work
[21:44] <genoobie> that error is *not* in xubuntu iirc
[21:45] <wxl> ahhhhhhh interesting
[21:45] <genoobie> in fact there are no errs in the xubuntu log
[21:45] <wxl> is there an /etc/X11/Xorg.conf on the xubuntu?
[21:46] <genoobie> no
[21:46] <genoobie> could one be created?
[21:46] <wxl> i also wonder if ti's not a mode setting of some kind
[21:46] <wxl> wrong refresh rate or something
[21:47] <genoobie> judging by the video output that's what it looks like
[21:47] <genoobie> I will say I took an Xorg.conf from puppylinux and tried to make that work
[21:47] <wxl> you can pass that through grub settings if need be, not to mention make an Xorg.conf
[21:47] <genoobie> the screen did change the output
[21:47] <wxl> but didn't entirely fix it?
[21:48] <genoobie> no
[21:49] <genoobie> not at all
[21:49] <wxl> the problem with using a whole Xorg.conf is that if it makes a change you don't necessarily know which part of it made the change
[21:49] <genoobie> not sure what you mean
[21:50] <wxl> well the Xorg.conf can specify a LOT of things and well beyond just graphics
[21:50] <wxl> brb in about 20 or so
[21:50] <genoobie> right, mouse kbd
[21:50] <genoobie> okay see you then
[21:54] <Unit193> I generally/recommend marking pastebin.com ones private as well: sudo sed s/private\ =\ 1/private\ =\ 0/ /usr/share/pastebin.d/pastebin.com.conf -i    And I did a compare of xubuntu-desktop and lubuntu-desktop, not much seemed to change, but that's not a clear picture of what's installed.  You could get a dpkg-query listing from Xubuntu, and compare drivers/xorg packages, see if anything differs.
[21:55] <Unit193> When I've had issues, it was with the i915 and 82845G/GL card, and they do have a few issues.
[21:56] <Unit193> Err, reverse the sed args, that was for testing. :)
[21:56] <genoobie> Unit193, I haven't posted the xubuntu stuff yet
[21:56] <genoobie> going to try that now...
[21:56] <genoobie> using cli and pastebinit
[21:56] <genoobie> but I may not be able to install off the livecd
[21:57] <Unit193> pastebinit is included in Xubuntu.
[22:00] <genoobie> okay the three xubuntu pastes, Xorg.log, lspci -vv and lsmod
[22:01] <genoobie> are http://paste.ubuntu.com/1590896 , http://paste.ubuntu.com/1590897 , http://paste.ubuntu.com/1590899
[22:03] <genoobie> I like both xubuntu and lubuntu
[22:03] <genoobie> this machine has 384MB ram and a PIII 800MHz
[22:03] <genoobie> I'm trying to get a decent computing experience for my kids
[22:03] <genoobie> that isnt' windows
[22:11] <genoobie> oaky
[22:11] <genoobie> wxl they are posted for you to see, I'll bb at 5:20 or so
[22:16] <Unit193> Could technically try installing from the mini, if else it fails.
[22:29] <genoobie> going to load up 12.04 desktop and see what happens...brb
[22:30] <genoobie> Unit193, is there anything else from the xubuntu live re:video info that I might need before I exit out?
[22:30] <genoobie> or wxl for that matter?
[22:30] <Unit193> dpkg-query -W --showformat='${Package}\n' | sort -nr | tee dpkg-query-`date +%d-%m-%Y`.list    then save that somewhere.
[22:34] <genoobie> Unit193, exactly that command?
[22:35] <Unit193> It'll save an entire package list.
[22:42] <wxl> back
[22:43] <genoobie> wxl
[22:43] <genoobie> hey
[22:43] <wxl> saw the urls
[22:43] <genoobie> cool
[22:43] <wxl> lspci on both say savagefb is being used
[22:44] <wxl> however lsmod shows savage on xubuntu but not lubuntu
[22:44] <wxl> also no drm
[22:44] <genoobie> yeah, what's up with that??
[22:44] <genoobie> heh
[22:45] <genoobie> so in a min I am going to boot up lubuntu live 12.04
[22:47] <wxl> an interesting thing is that xubuntu picks up on the exact chip
[22:47] <wxl> [   577.798] (--) SAVAGE(0): Chip: id 8c12, "Savage/IX-MV"
[22:47] <wxl> lubuntu doesn't seem to
[22:47] <wxl> so something is amiss with the probing
[22:51] <genoobie> sorry
[22:51] <genoobie> I am going through about 10 cdroms trying to find lubuntu 12.04
[22:52] <wxl> hey could you do me a favor and on both the xubuntu and the lubuntu see what version of the driver you have? apt-cache policy xserver-xorg-video-savage | grep -i installed
[22:52] <wxl> i suspect 1:2.3.6-0ubuntu1 is the problem
[22:52] <genoobie> okay, remember, my xubuntu takes 1/2 to boot
[22:52] <genoobie> 1/2 and hour
[22:53] <genoobie> so let's do the xubuntu stuff 1st
[22:53] <wxl> which has been around since 12.04 -- but only in the updates. the original version that shipped was 1:2.3.3-1ubuntu1
[22:54] <genoobie> wxl for xubuntu 1:2.3.3-1ubuntu1
[22:54] <genoobie> any way to get this from a mounted lubuntu partition?
[22:54] <wxl> um
[22:55] <wxl> don't think so unfortunately
[22:55] <wxl> unless Unit193 has some ideas
[22:55] <genoobie> hrm
[22:56] <genoobie> any way to load "lubuntu" from the xubuntu enviro?
[22:57] <wxl> Unit193: can you use dpkg somehow to do that?
[22:59] <wxl> hey
[22:59] <wxl> did you get a blank screen???
[22:59] <genoobie> no, it was striped
[22:59] <wxl> hm
[22:59] <genoobie> blocky....hold a sec I can post a pic :)
[22:59] <wxl> well still the Xorg.conf from here may be useful:
[22:59] <wxl> http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/S3_Savage_IX8
[23:00] <genoobie> http://postimage.org/image/75qnjvz91/03904636/
[23:00] <genoobie> wxl at least to get it working...
[23:01] <genoobie> so just copy that into the /etc/X11 dir?
[23:01] <wxl> that's at least better than the last ppc boot i did :)
[23:01] <wxl> well i don't remember if there are any other required sections
[23:01] <genoobie> wxl, I don't have rw rights to the lubuntu partition
[23:02] <genoobie> any way to change this so I can jam it in there and try on next boot?
[23:02] <genoobie> do you see the pic
[23:02] <genoobie> it's trying
[23:02] <genoobie> when I push keys it changes a bit
[23:02] <wxl> this is long winded but this is a good intro to how to do Xorg.confs even though it is specific to ppc https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ#How_do_I_configure_an_xorg.conf_file.3F
[23:02] <genoobie> wxl
[23:02] <wxl> well if you don't have rw rights that's problematic of course XD
[23:02] <wxl> can you get to a virtual terminal at all?
[23:02] <genoobie> anyway to make that rw at all
[23:03] <wxl> ctrl-alt-f1 for example?
[23:03] <genoobie> um, you mean at boot, of course
[23:03] <wxl> well when you get that goofy screen
[23:03] <genoobie> I was just thinking I could do it from xubuntu platform
[23:03] <genoobie> wxl do you think 12.04 might resolve this?
[23:03] <wxl> that's my current theory
[23:03] <wxl> if and only if you use the OLD version of the driver
[23:04] <wxl> which is to say the second you update it might try to upgrade it for you
[23:04] <genoobie> wxl, how could I accomplish this...
[23:04] <wxl> as the new version is now in precise-updates
[23:04] <genoobie> oh, hrm
[23:04] <wxl> but i could be wrong
[23:04] <wxl> too many variables still
[23:04] <genoobie> so what strategy do you suggest, should I end my xubuntu?
[23:04] <genoobie> urgh
[23:04] <genoobie> should I try to work from lubuntu from this point on?
[23:05] <wxl> find out what version you're using first
[23:05] <genoobie> wxl what version of what?
[23:05] <genoobie> dkpg?
[23:05] <wxl> apt-cache policy xorg-xserver-savage-video | grep -i installed
[23:05] <genoobie> so that would end my xubuntu
[23:05] <wxl> no
[23:05] <genoobie> my lubuntu 12.04 is almost done
[23:05] <Unit193> wxl: Can always chroot.
[23:05] <wxl> do that in xubuntu
[23:06] <genoobie> oh I did and posted
[23:06] <wxl> ah yes chroot
[23:06] <wxl> you did?
[23:06] <genoobie> 1:2.3.3-1ubuntu1
[23:06] <wxl> oh you did
[23:06] <wxl> :)
[23:06] <genoobie> okay, so what would you like me to do...
[23:06] <wxl> so yeah don't upgrade your packages on that machine or if you do make sure you don't that one
[23:06] <wxl> now try out lubuntu 12.04
[23:06] <wxl> betcha it works like a dream
[23:07] <genoobie> the package I am *not* upgrading is xorg-xserver-savage-video?
[23:07] <wxl> yep
[23:07] <genoobie> okay
[23:07] <wxl> 12.10 has the upgraded version
[23:07] <genoobie> everything else...okay
[23:07] <wxl> so does 13.04 etc. etc.
[23:07] <genoobie> uh-oh
[23:07] <Unit193> wxl: Have him hold it.
[23:07] <wxl> yep from what i can tell so far
[23:07] <wxl> Unit193: will do once we can confirm
[23:07] <Unit193> And I'm back out.
[23:07] <genoobie> okay, so leaving xubuntu, trying, lubuntu 12.04
[23:08] <genoobie> ugh, is the "desktop" a live cd?
[23:08] <wxl> yep
[23:08] <genoobie> okay, like I said, 1/2 hour to boot
[23:08] <genoobie> so you are sure we need nothing else from xubuntu
[23:09] <wxl> yep
[23:10] <genoobie> okay
[23:10] <genoobie> shutting down xubuntu
[23:10] <genoobie> uploaded my dkpg to pastebin
[23:11] <genoobie> like I said before, the lubuntu splash screen with four dots is visible then...dead
[23:11] <genoobie> wxl, try without installing...
[23:12] <genoobie> hopefully it won't look at the installed lubuntu
[23:12] <genoobie> if this works, then just install this and not update xorg-xserver-savage-video
[23:12] <genoobie> hopefully the other hardware works, I didn't even check
[23:12] <genoobie> urgh
[23:13] <genoobie> puppy linux is ok :)\
[23:13] <genoobie> btw I *totally* appreciate the time on this
[23:13] <genoobie> wxl, do you think lubuntu is a good fit for this machine?
[23:13] <genoobie> would antix or bodhi linux be better?
[23:13] <genoobie> (antix was previously peanut)
[23:14] <wxl> sorry disappeared a bit
[23:14] <wxl> i think lubuntu is good on almost anything
[23:14] <wxl> i'm not a huge fan of bodhi but it's alright
[23:14] <wxl> never tried antix
[23:14] <wxl> puppy is not my favorite at all
[23:15] <wxl> part of the reason why i stick around here is because i just love lubuntu :)
[23:17] <genoobie> looks like lubuntu is booting up nicely
[23:17]  * wxl waits patiently
[23:17] <genoobie> I see a mouse cursor
[23:17] <genoobie> and a voila
[23:17] <wxl> XD
[23:17] <genoobie> desktop and everything
[23:17] <genoobie> going to install this...
[23:18] <genoobie> should I reboot or install right from here...
[23:18] <genoobie> part of the deal is to get the machines in the house all on the same OS
[23:18] <genoobie> and if people want something different they can go from there...
[23:18] <wxl> i'd install from there probably
[23:19] <wxl> here's how to hold your package:
[23:19] <genoobie> okay
[23:19] <genoobie> going to write this down...
[23:19] <wxl> echo "xorg-xserver-savage-video hold" | dpkg --set-selections
[23:19] <wxl> now you have to manually remove that hold
[23:20] <genoobie> if the bug is fixed
[23:20] <wxl> that being said, i would encourage you to keep an eye on that package
[23:20] <genoobie> what would I be looking for in that pkg?
[23:20] <wxl> if there's a NEW version available, then download a live cd with it and try it out
[23:21] <wxl> you'd look for a higher version number really
[23:21] <wxl> i  would also personally recommend reporting a bug on this
[23:21] <wxl> let the hardcore x hackers figure it out
[23:21] <wxl> i, unfortunately, am not one of them
[23:21] <wxl> ubuntu-bug xorg-xserver-savage-video
[23:21] <wxl> if you don't have a launchpad account you'll have to create one
[23:22] <genoobie> okay let me cli
[23:22] <wxl> provide as much info as possible, including relevant information from your lsmod and Xorg.0.log
[23:29] <genoobie> wxl is that a command?
[23:29] <wxl> ubuntu-bug xorg-xserver-savage-video
[23:30] <genoobie> and we are sure that is the bug
[23:30] <wxl> are we sure? not 100%
[23:30] <wxl> but i think we have a lot of good evidence to support it
[23:30] <wxl> i'd say 90%
[23:30] <wxl> it's ok to have an invalid bug
[23:30] <wxl> i've done them before
[23:30] <wxl> even once because i used a command wrong :)
[23:31] <wxl> no one yells at you
[23:31] <wxl> :)
[23:32] <genoobie> hey I tried the apt-cache cmd from the
[23:32] <genoobie> cli
[23:32] <genoobie> and it was blank
[23:32] <genoobie> apt-cache policy xorg-xserver-savage-video | grep -i installed
[23:32] <wxl> apt-cache policy xorg-xserver-savage-video | grep -i installed
[23:32] <wxl> ?
[23:32] <genoobie> blank
[23:32] <wxl> strang
[23:32] <wxl> e
[23:32] <genoobie> returns null
[23:33] <wxl> try apt-cache policy xorg-xserver-savage-video
[23:33] <genoobie> unable to locate pkg
[23:33] <genoobie> gah!
[23:33] <wxl> oh
[23:33] <wxl> i'm an idiot
[23:33] <genoobie> so forget the hold thing
[23:33] <genoobie> oh nm
[23:33] <wxl> wait on the hold until you're installed
[23:33] <genoobie> okay
[23:33] <wxl> also you got to get the package name right
[23:33] <wxl> too many darn words in it
[23:34] <wxl> xserver-xorg-video-savage
[23:34] <genoobie> oh
[23:34] <genoobie> heh
[23:34] <wxl> so any time i mentioned xorg-xserver-savage-video or some combination thereof, use xserver-xorg-video-savage instead XD
[23:34] <genoobie> blank again
[23:35] <genoobie> nope I think it was right the first time
[23:35] <wxl> hm
[23:35] <genoobie> so now what...
[23:35] <wxl> try apt-cache search-savage
[23:35] <wxl> argh
[23:35] <wxl> try apt-cache search savage
[23:35] <genoobie> okay
[23:35] <genoobie> three
[23:36] <genoobie> xserver-xorg-video-s3
[23:36] <genoobie> xserver-xorg-video-savage
[23:36] <genoobie> xserver-xorg-video-s3virge
[23:36] <genoobie> s3switch - Manage the output device on S3 Savage chips
[23:37] <wxl> try apt-cache policy apt-cache policy xserver-xorg-video-savage
[23:37] <wxl> no grep
[23:37] <genoobie> apt-cache policy twice?
[23:37] <wxl> no
[23:37] <wxl> jeez
[23:37] <wxl> i need to do one thing at a time
[23:37] <genoobie> yep
[23:37] <genoobie> there it is
[23:37] <wxl> (as an aside, you can keep track of any updates to the package here: http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/xserver-xorg-video-savage)
[23:37] <wxl> so what does it say for installed?
[23:37] <genoobie> should I check the lubuntu 12.10
[23:38] <wxl> don't tell me (none) cuz that would be nuts
[23:38] <genoobie> same as xubuntu
[23:38] <wxl> good
[23:38] <genoobie> okay ubuntu-bug xserver-xorg-video-savage
[23:39] <genoobie> apport is working
[23:39] <wxl> yay
[23:39] <genoobie> does that hold thing still work
[23:39] <wxl> wait til your installed
[23:40] <genoobie> yes of course
[23:40] <genoobie> now, how can I add lsmod and xorg log
[23:40] <wxl> just include the urls
[23:40] <genoobie> cool
[23:41] <genoobie> how can I access the bug to do that?
[23:41] <wxl> well ubuntu-bug should take yo uto a launchpad login…
[23:41] <wxl> if not just wait some more XD
[23:41] <genoobie> yeah, no launchpad yet
[23:42] <wxl> you're live and without much ram, so be patient
[23:42] <genoobie> um, when I tried loading the b43legacy pcmcia wireless driver it froze (xubuntu)
[23:42] <genoobie> any way to stop that from happening?
[23:42] <genoobie> I'm going to try and stream some youtube now
[23:42] <genoobie> :)
[23:42] <wxl> you should check your logs and see what happened
[23:43] <genoobie> what do you mean...
[23:43] <wxl> well it may report some error or something
[23:43] <wxl> which may indicate the cause for the freezingf
[23:44] <genoobie> oh...holy cow
[23:44] <genoobie> something is happening :)
[23:44] <genoobie> your guess xubuntu 12.10 is borked the same way...
[23:44] <wxl> that's my guess
[23:45] <genoobie> so include the Xorg and lsmod
[23:45] <wxl> however if you want to be super-completist, you could try a live 12.10 and see what happens
[23:45] <wxl> yeah
[23:45] <genoobie> meh, 12.04 is fine for me
[23:45] <wxl> personally i'd include both
[23:45] <wxl> what i mean by completist is in terms of providing the maximum amount of information and eliminating the most amount of variables so that the bug squashers can figure out what's going on
[23:50] <genoobie> urgh
[23:50] <genoobie> I cannot log in to launch pad
[23:50] <genoobie> wtf!
[23:50] <wxl> you forgot your pw or what?
[23:50] <genoobie> no
[23:50] <genoobie> I just created an account and it is stuck on the "update" page
[23:51] <wxl> hm
[23:51] <genoobie> I update and it does not progress
[23:51] <wxl> you could try leaving your browser open and running ubuntu-bug again
[23:52] <genoobie> no I am setting up the account on another machine so I don't have to eff with it
[23:52] <wxl> oh
[23:52] <wxl> hm
[23:52] <genoobie> I just thought of something, the lubuntu that has the bug has to be booted to report the bug
[23:53] <genoobie> there must be another way to report this bug
[23:53] <wxl> you can just log onto launchpad and do it manually
[23:53] <genoobie> sounds fine
[23:54] <genoobie> besides I couldn't launch launchpad from the borked install anyhow
[23:54] <wxl> it won't collect any info but that's not necessarily all that important, as long as you specify which chip you have (you can pull that from the lspci)
[23:54] <genoobie> which video chip?
[23:54] <wxl> ya
[23:55] <genoobie> okay hold a sec, let me install this lubuntu
[23:55] <wxl> k
[23:55] <genoobie> oh
[23:55] <genoobie> uh oh
[23:55] <genoobie> the launchpad login is working
[23:56] <wxl> it's ok
[23:56] <genoobie> however, the informat that it collected is wrong
[23:56] <wxl> only on the os
[23:56] <wxl> but  the hardware info is correct
[23:56] <wxl> just make it clear
[23:56] <wxl> which version of the driver is the problem in which version of the os etc etc
[23:57] <genoobie> wxl, which version is it that is broken
[23:58] <wxl> 1:2.3.6-0ubuntu
[23:58] <wxl> which exists in quantal/12.10 and raring/13.04 as well as precise-updates
