[08:17] <Kilos> good ty
[08:18] <staticrat> so maaz is a bot
[08:18] <Kilos> yip a clever one
[08:18] <staticrat> ok humour me
[08:18] <staticrat> how do I use maaz?
[08:18] <Kilos> you type in his nick first then what you need him to do
[08:19] <Kilos> start with help
[08:19] <staticrat> maaz help
[08:19] <Maaz> staticrat: I can help you with: looking things up, remembering things, delivering messages, decisions, games, monitoring things, browsing the internet, conversions, silly fun stuff, calculations, system administration, software development and south african stuff.
[08:19] <Maaz> Ask me "help me with ..." for more details.
[08:20] <staticrat> maaz help me with 6700*67
[08:20] <Maaz> staticrat: I'm afraid I don't know what you are asking about. Ask "what can you do" to browse my features.
[08:20] <staticrat> lol
[08:20] <Kilos> whats 6700*67
[08:21] <staticrat> lol
[08:21] <staticrat> calculations
[08:21] <staticrat> would i then rather ask: Maaz help me with calculations 6700 * 67
[08:21] <Kilos> then ask him help me with calculations 
[08:21] <Kilos> lol
[08:22] <Kilos> leave the numbers off
[08:22]  * staticrat is learning to use a bot
[08:22] <staticrat> maaz help me with calculations
[08:22] <Maaz> staticrat: I use the following features for calculations: base, base64, bc, calc, distance, google, hash, ipcalc, nickometer, oeis and random
[08:22] <Maaz> Ask me "how do I use ..." for more details.
[08:22] <Kilos> one needs to learn what commands etc he accepts and how
[08:23] <staticrat> maaz how do I use looking things up
[08:23] <Maaz> staticrat: I'm afraid I don't know what you are asking about. Ask "what can you do" to browse my features.
[08:23] <staticrat> maaz how do I use
[08:23] <Maaz> staticrat: Please be more specific. I don't know if you mean auth, dict or help
[08:23] <staticrat> im not getting it
[08:24] <Kilos> Maaz, help me withdistance
[08:24] <Maaz> Kilos: Sorry...
[08:24] <Kilos> ai
[08:24] <Kilos> Maaz, help me with distance
[08:24] <Maaz> Kilos: I'm afraid I don't know what you are asking about. Ask "what can you do" to browse my features.
[08:24] <staticrat> you see
[08:24] <Kilos> Maaz, how do i use distance
[08:24] <Maaz> Kilos: Returns the distance between two places. You can use it like this:
[08:24] <Maaz>   distance [in <unit>] between <source> and <destination>
[08:24] <Maaz>   place search for <placename>
[08:25] <staticrat> maaz, how do i use calc
[08:25] <Maaz> staticrat: Returns the anwser to mathematical expressions. Uses Python syntax and semantics (i.e. radians). You can use it like this:
[08:25] <Maaz>   calc <expression>
[08:25] <Maaz>   <expression>
[08:25] <staticrat> maaz, calc 6700 * 67
[08:25] <Maaz> staticrat: 448900
[08:25] <Kilos> one needs to get things right with him. 
[08:25] <staticrat> yeah
[08:26] <staticrat> ok it is now beginning to sink in
[08:26] <tumbleweed> or you could just say
[08:26] <tumbleweed> Maaz: 6700 * 67
[08:26] <Maaz> tumbleweed: 448900
[08:26] <Kilos> Maaz, distance in kilometres pretoria to capetown
[08:26] <Maaz> Kilos: Huh?
[08:26] <Kilos> ai
[08:26] <tumbleweed> Kilos: "between"
[08:26] <staticrat> lol kilos
[08:26] <Kilos> ah ty tumbleweed 
[08:27] <tumbleweed> also to -> and
[08:27] <staticrat> hi tumbleweed
[08:27] <tumbleweed> hi
[08:27] <Kilos> anyway tumbleweed i have some feedback on deb-delta server for us. must it be so masive
[08:27] <staticrat> so asking maaz to google something, would require what?
[08:27] <Kilos> I will have to think about a strategy to implement this for ubuntu. My main concern is the hdd space it will require, approximately 620GB. 
[08:27] <tumbleweed> Kilos: I'm afraid I know very little about deb-delta
[08:28] <tumbleweed> Kilos: I suggest playing with it to find out
[08:28] <Kilos> i cant find anyone to ask either. even went to debian lists but thats no easy
[08:28] <Kilos> ok will keep looking ty
[08:28] <staticrat> maaz help
[08:28] <Maaz> staticrat: I can help you with: looking things up, remembering things, delivering messages, decisions, games, monitoring things, browsing the internet, conversions, silly fun stuff, calculations, system administration, software development and south african stuff.
[08:28] <Maaz> Ask me "help me with ..." for more details.
[08:29] <staticrat> maaz, help me with looking things up
[08:29] <Maaz> staticrat: I use the following features for looking things up: apt-file, aptitude, bash, bible, dict, distance, dns, factoid, feeds, fml, fortune, google, help, imdb, lastfm, lotto, mac, man, microblog, mlia, oeis, ports, rfc, seen, tfln, tinyurl, tld, translate, tvshow, unicode, weather and youtube
[08:29] <Maaz> Ask me "how do I use ..." for more details.
[08:29] <Kilos> thats why i wanted the dev teams. to try find out who does that package
[08:29] <staticrat> maaz, how do I use google
[08:29] <Maaz> staticrat: Retrieves results from Google and Google Calculator. You can use it like this:
[08:29] <Maaz>   google[.<tld>] [for] <term>
[08:29] <Maaz>   googlefight [for] <term> and <term>
[08:29] <Maaz>   gcalc <expression>
[08:29] <Maaz>   gdefine <term>
[08:29] <Kilos> but i forgot
[08:30] <staticrat> maaz, google fastest recorded broadband speed
[08:30] <Maaz> staticrat: "75-year-old pensioner has fastest broadband | News | TechRadar" http://www.techradar.com/us/news/video/hd-dvd/television/hdtv/broadband/internet/web/home-cinema/high-definition/75-year-old-pensioner-has-fastest-broadband-131117 :: "'World's fastest broadband' trials successfully produces speeds 240 ..."

[08:31] <staticrat> cool I kinda like this bot, could be very useful
[08:32] <staticrat> it would be cool to have such a bot in your HUD
[08:32] <Kilos> he is just a bit long in the tooth. you can use mine on ##kilos
[08:33] <Kilos> she should greet you when you get there

[08:43] <Kilos> yw
[08:44] <staticrat> so your bot works the same as maaz
[08:45] <Kilos> same bot just a later version done by tumbleweed 
[08:45] <Kilos> they are in the repos
[08:45] <Kilos> ibid
[08:46] <staticrat> oh was wondering yesterday what ibid was used for
[09:09] <Kilos> staticrat, you can sudo aptitude install glipper to put a clipboard on the top bar that remembers the links and stuff you use
[09:09] <staticrat> this is like a overflow of knowledge
[09:10] <Kilos> lol
[09:10] <staticrat> something weird is happening inmy brain\
[09:12] <Squirm> last day of course :/
[09:12] <Squirm> it's actually quite nice
[09:14] <Kilos> you gonna crack it Squirm ?
[09:14] <Kilos> you gotta write exam?
[09:25] <Kilos> Maaz, lpi manual
[09:25] <Maaz> http://www.linuxcertification.co.za/lpi-study-manual
[09:25] <Kilos> staticrat, ^^
[09:26] <staticrat> thx this site was booked marked before it opened lol
[09:26] <Kilos> lol
[09:46] <superfly> ohi
[09:48] <staticrat> hey superfly
[09:50] <inetpro> good morning Kilos
[09:50] <inetpro> oh and hi everyone else as well
[09:50]  * Kilos waves to the pro
[09:50] <Kilos> late again as usual
[09:51] <staticrat> hi inetpro
[09:51] <inetpro> ai!
[09:53] <Kilos> haha
[09:54]  * staticrat is currently stuffing his face with ice cream and therefore unable to use the keyboard
[09:55] <plustwo> inetpro: lo
[10:24] <Kilos> inetpro, did you see what the bloem varsity said the size of the deb-delta server must be?
[10:24] <Kilos> whew
[10:28]  * staticrat thinks ice cream is the next best thing to toast
[10:28] <Kilos> lol
[10:28] <inetpro> Kilos: no
[10:29] <Kilos>  I will have to think about a strategy to implement this for ubuntu. My main concern is the hdd space it will require, approximately 620GB. 
[10:29] <Kilos> thats feedback from them
[10:29] <inetpro> ai!
[10:29] <Kilos> i dunno how it can be that big
[10:30] <inetpro> haha
[10:30] <inetpro> Kilos: of course it will have to be big
[10:30] <Kilos> all the ubuntus together arent so much
[10:30] <inetpro> ja?
[10:31] <Kilos> well i think each repo is about 80g
[10:31] <Kilos> isnt it
[10:31] <inetpro> Kilos: ask Symmetria, he will tell you about size of mirrors
[10:31] <Kilos> i think he is hiding
[10:31] <Kilos> hehe
[10:32] <inetpro> Kilos: and it will constantly have to be updated as things change as well
[10:32] <Kilos> i think i can do that if i get to ssh to it
[10:32] <inetpro> ai!
[10:32] <Kilos> or Symmetria will have to
[10:33] <inetpro> nee man, die goed word ge-automate
[10:34] <Kilos> more feedback
[10:34] <Kilos> spam coming
[10:34] <Kilos> It is the size of the the current ubuntu repo which is rsynced to mirror.ufs.ac.za. debdelta uses deb-mirror to mirror the repo, any updates are flagged and then diffed. This leaves me with two choices:
[10:34] <Kilos> 1) Use rsync and setup debdelta to mirror ubuntu a second time and include the deltas.
[10:34] <Kilos> 2) Switch from rsync to debdelta for ubuntu. I favour rsync for mirroring especially for the larger repos, so I am not keen on doing this. 
[10:34] <Kilos> There is no LVM or btrfs to do snapshotting, which leaves me with less options. Like I said, I need to think about this maybe there is another, better, way.
[10:39]  * Kilos holds thumbs
[10:40] <Kilos> im not sure if it must host both the ununtu and debdelta servers there or if they can be synced from the existing one
[10:41] <Kilos> but it it works it will save us tons on data costs and upgrade speeds
[10:42] <Kilos> inetpro, ^^
[10:44] <inetpro> Kilos: this is perhaps a debate that guys should have at #ubuntu-mirrors
[10:45] <inetpro> "There's a team working on improving user experiences every day, making Ubuntu available to you."
[10:45] <inetpro> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors
[10:46] <inetpro> they shouldn't do this in isolation
[10:46] <tumbleweed> Kilos: yes, you will need a full mirror to generate debdeltas
[10:48] <Kilos> i dont know enough to go debate it man. they will thin where does this guy come from
[10:48] <Kilos> ty tumbleweed 
[10:50] <inetpro> Kilos: well I like your persistence regarding the matter 
[10:51] <Kilos> lol im trying to save data man
[10:55] <Kilos> whew
[10:59] <Kilos> we need a 1TB drive just for us
[10:59] <Kilos> Symmetria, donate
[11:11] <inetpro> Kilos: 1TB is actually not that much any more these days
[12:34] <Squirm> got my midmar mile entry sms now
[12:34] <Squirm> turns out I'm blue cap(2nd group)
[12:34] <Squirm> I haven't trained and I haven't done the mile in 2/3 years

[12:52] <Kilos> hi Trixar_za 
[12:53] <Trixar_za> Hey Kilos
[12:53] <Kilos> we got another ubuntu convert
[12:53] <Kilos> took 13 years to wake up
[12:53] <staticrat> thats not true
[12:54] <Kilos> rofl
[12:54] <staticrat> its more like 12 years and 11 months
[12:54] <staticrat> lol
[12:54] <Kilos> ah sorry
[12:54] <zeref> hmmmmm
[12:54] <Kilos> hi hmmmmer
[12:55] <Kilos> where you been zeref 
[12:55]  * staticrat waves hello to everyone
[12:55] <zeref> busy busy bust learning web frameworks.
[12:55] <Kilos> ah
[12:56] <zeref> have got some free time....hence hmmmmm
[12:56] <Trixar_za> There are some non-Ubuntu users in this channel. Hell, I know of some that are strict Windows supporters :P
[12:57] <Kilos> where??
[12:57] <Kilos> shoot em
[12:57] <Kilos> linux users welcome
[12:58] <Trixar_za> I forget their nicknames because it was so long ago. Maybe they converted the last few years :P
[12:58] <Kilos> hehe
[12:58] <Trixar_za> I don't mind Windows supporters, but just don't try converting me back :P
[12:58] <Kilos> or they just lurk in shame
[12:59] <Kilos> hows things with studies
[12:59] <Kilos> any luck
[12:59] <Trixar_za> Squirm asked his lecturer about places that may do Red Hat courses in Cape Town
[13:00] <Trixar_za> He gave me the names, LSD seems promising
[13:00] <Kilos> nice
[13:00] <Trixar_za> Still have to find the right Smart Source and CTU courses sites if they still exist :P
[13:10] <Trixar_za> Bleh
[13:10] <Trixar_za> SmartSource now only caters to business development and motivation
[13:11] <Trixar_za> and CTU is now a Microsoft certification drone
[13:11] <Kilos> ai
[13:11] <Trixar_za> LSD is the only one remaining
[13:12] <Trixar_za> It's really sad
[13:14] <Trixar_za> You know in America this would be easy. You'd have LUG meetings all over the place and at every university of note with lectures by noted Linux royalty
[13:14] <Trixar_za> But no, here we're slaves to the Windows Partnership program - the same program that has bankrupted COUNTRIES
[13:14] <Trixar_za> Idiots
[13:16]  * Squirm prods Trixar_za 
=== Trixar_za is now known as Trix[a]r_za
[13:17] <Squirm> or not
[13:17] <staticrat> I did not realize there was such hate for MS
[13:18] <Kilos> its not hate 
[13:18] <Kilos> its worse
[13:18] <staticrat> lol
[13:18] <Kilos> hate is for a neighbours dog that barks all night
[13:19] <staticrat> the deepest pits of hell is reserved for windows users.....
[13:19] <Kilos> hahaha
[13:19]  * staticrat thinks he going to end up there
[13:20] <staticrat> ok I have a excuse for using windows
[13:20] <staticrat> Gaming
[13:22] <staticrat> my notebook is now running linux but my pc will stay with windows....aint ready to give up playing CIV5 
=== Trix[a]r_za is now known as Trixar_za
[13:33] <Trixar_za> No, I don't hate Windows users
[13:33] <Trixar_za> I hate Microsoft programs
[13:33] <Trixar_za> As in training or advertising programs, not software :P
[13:33] <staticrat> ah
[13:34] <staticrat> just needed clarity, thought you might axe me or something since I am still a windows user
[13:35] <Trixar_za> Damn, I missed it :(
[13:35] <Trixar_za> The training course was on the 7th
[13:35] <Trixar_za> Also ouch, R13k with the exam - but it's worth it
[13:35] <Trixar_za> 13,6k to be exact
[13:36] <Trixar_za> Btw Thanks Squirm
[13:38] <Squirm> anyway Trix
[13:38] <Squirm> doing cifs shares
[13:39] <Trixar_za> I think I'll contact LSD to find out if they're doing any courses before September again, otherwise I'm screwed for half a year :P
[13:40] <Trixar_za> Btw staticrat: FreeCiv
[13:40] <Trixar_za> :P
[13:43] <Squirm> Perspective Employer: "So how did you get your RHCE", Trixar_za: "Through LSD"
[13:44] <Trixar_za> Yeah, I can see how that can be a problem
[13:44] <Trixar_za> lol
[13:47] <staticrat> I saw that but it not as good as CIV5
[13:48] <Trixar_za> The Tilesets make it pretty good
[13:48] <Trixar_za> and I don't know, I found the first CIV fun even with it's crappy graphics
[13:48] <Trixar_za> Note, I played the first one around the time the 4th one came out
[13:48] <Trixar_za> :P
[13:48] <staticrat> lol
[13:49] <Trixar_za> <3 Dosbox
[13:49] <staticrat> i got the gods and kings expansion and love to start my own religion
[13:49] <staticrat> funny as hell when ghandi wants to join urkism
[13:50] <staticrat> dosbox is cool, used to play transport tycoon using dosbox
[13:51] <staticrat> anyway my time is up. I have allot of reading material to keep me busy tonight hopefully by tomorrow i will be some what better at linux
[13:51]  * staticrat says good afternoon, good evening and good night
[13:52] <Trixar_za> There is another one, but I prefer not to mention it

[17:17] <magespawn> Hey hey, whats up y'all?
[17:17] <Kilos> same old same old. where you been? poaching again?
[17:18] <magespawn> Yup all day today
[17:18] <Kilos> and yesterday?
[17:18] <Kilos> you been away a while
[17:19] <magespawn> I was here yesterday, i think?
[17:19] <Kilos> oh my
[17:20] <magespawn> Pretty sure but only in the morning.
[17:20] <Kilos> maybe i was away. i forget
[17:20] <Kilos> tried xfce here
[17:20] <Kilos> sucks
[17:22] <Kilos> maybe ill stay with unity and kde
[17:25] <Cantide> xfce sucks? 'o'
[17:25] <Cantide> can't say i've heard that before
[17:25] <Kilos> ya doesnt even show nm
[17:25] <Kilos> i like to see my connection
[17:26] <Cantide> ah
[17:26] <Cantide> surely there is a way around that..
[17:26] <Cantide> but maybe more trouble than you're prepared for :p
[17:26] <Kilos> but it was only 9m download so will look at it again sometime
[17:26] <Cantide> haha

[17:30] <Cantide> yeah, i'm sure i'd like that, too
[17:31] <Cantide> although my current PC handles unity perfectly well
[17:31] <Kilos> maybe its just the diffs. one needs to look for stuff in other places

[17:32] <Cantide> yeah, any new interface takes some getting used to
[17:32] <Kilos> hi timkeller

[17:32] <Cantide> hi timkeller :p

[19:14] <Squirm> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBirGakU9ME If you want to be blown away by South African music. 
[19:15] <superfly> it's only 9pm, you need to get to at least 10pm before it starts getting close to "late"
[19:15] <Squirm> it's really worth a listen to
[19:19] <superfly> Squirm: also a local guy (I know him personally) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9AaCbnOisU
[19:20] <Squirm> I play squash with her mother
[19:20]  * Squirm listens
[19:23] <Squirm> superfly: they're pretty good. I don't think small, local artists actually get the exposure they deserve
[19:26] <superfly> Squirm: Shaun Jacobs will be live on Jacaranda FM tomorrow morning at 10:30
[19:27] <superfly> dunno if you can get that radio station (being in Cape Town, it's out of range for me ;-) )
[19:27] <Squirm> I'm in jhb till Sunday
