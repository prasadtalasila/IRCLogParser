[17:46] <newEdubuntu> good after noon
[17:56] <patClassroom> hello i am looking for a remote  team brower app...for dictation writing project
[17:58] <alkisg> What does "remote team browser" mean? More details?
[18:25] <patClassroom> alkisg : to share brownser for a remote classroom project the teacher will dictate , the student will type ; the teacher will be able to see what they type ...
[18:26] <alkisg> patClassroom: so, "share browser" isn't related to a shared web browser, it's a student screen monitoring tool?
[18:26] <alkisg> Like epoptes.org or italc.sf.net?
[18:29] <patClassroom> a audio chat not video conferencing by a browser ...i want to stay lite not a vnc, teamviewer remote desktop
[18:33] <alkisg> Well for audio chatting there's egika, but many prefer skype instead, and for sharing/typing together with others there's gobby
[18:34] <alkisg> So you could e.g. have 10 gobby windows open, one for each student, to see what they type in real time
[18:36] <alkisg> You could even setup a streaming audio server with vlc
[18:36] <patClassroom> audio chat with skype could go up to 10 receiver ?
[18:36] <alkisg> I'm not sure about the skype limits, with egika there are not hard limits
[18:41] <patClassroom> for the writing conference i am testing google document or drive  i can share a file with every student ...i just need the audio solution , need to dictate once for 10 terminal receiver
[18:43] <alkisg> egika, amsn, all those should work fine, just declare 10 contacts there and you're done
[18:48] <patClassroom> so every one should install egika and start the server ?   ok alkisg i shall take look thank you ...those student are nepali children , the teacher are french locate in France
[19:20] <alkisg> Well if their bandwidth is too low, you might want to look to some proxy solution, i.e. to have your mic transferred only once, and then multicasted "locally" in nepal
