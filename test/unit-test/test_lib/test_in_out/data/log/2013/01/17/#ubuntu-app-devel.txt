[11:53] <christoffer> How do I disable Apport while developing?
[12:01] <qwertzui11> christoffer: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport
[12:02] <christoffer> qwertzui11, thanks, yea had read through that page but didn't find what I was looking for. The following answer on askubuntu seems to have done the trick though http://askubuntu.com/questions/93457/how-do-i-enable-or-disable-apport
[12:09] <qwertzui11> christoffer: ah, good to know

[16:38] <stqn> hi
[16:38] <qwertzui11> hu
[17:41] <mh0> How do I complain about the Ubuntu Software Center Review Process?
[17:42] <mh0> It's been more than 2 weeks, and my app is still "Pending Review"
[17:42] <qwertzui11> write another "Feedback"
[17:43] <qwertzui11> however 2 weeks isn't that bad for Canonicals review process :D
[17:43] <qwertzui11> i was once waiting 4 months
[17:44] <qwertzui11> mh0: if i remember right u may wanna shout @ zoopster...
[17:44] <mh0> Surely if they want application developers to target Ubuntu platforms, they should try and make this app review process short and sweet?
[17:44] <mh0> I'll give him a ping and talk stuff via PM
[17:45] <qwertzui11> mh0: totally agree... it's currently terrible... however they changed it several weeks ago... so it should be better now... again write another entry in "Feedback"... maybe there was a bug
[17:46] <mh0> Where would this Feedback button be?
[17:46] <qwertzui11> sec
[17:47] <qwertzui11> @ https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/ click on ur project
[17:47] <zoopster> mh0: what is the application?
[17:47] <mh0> zoopster: "Clock"
[18:03] <dpm> mh0, ah, you're on this channel too :) To provide some more context to what we're doing to solve this, here's how we're planning to automate the process: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppDevUploadProcess
[18:05] <mh0> Seems a rather alright system
[19:37] <ziyadb> Good evening guys!
[19:38] <qwertzui11> hi
[19:40] <ziyadb> Here's a mockup of the app I'm working on. Any thoughts are greatly appreciated: http://i.imgur.com/C0vmk.png
[19:44] <mh0> ziyadb: Dude, that's nice!
[19:44] <ziyadb> mh0: heh, thanks!
[19:45] <mh0> ziyadb: Is it HTML5 based like my app http://michealhark.tk/applications/clock ?
[19:46] <ziyadb> mh0: nope, native app.
[19:46] <mh0> Ooh, even better!
[19:46] <ziyadb> html5 isn't quite there yet.
[19:46] <ziyadb> i.e doesn't afford the level of interaction I have planned.
[19:47] <mh0> node.js is a huge help though
[19:47] <stqn> when you say native, do you mean Gtk3?
[19:48] <stqn> just curious.
[19:48] <ziyadb> stqn: I'll probably write it in Qt for portability.
[19:48] <stqn> ok
[20:04] <ziyadb> mh0: clock looks _awesome_ downloading.
[20:22] <ziyadb> mh0: 65MB when installed?!
[20:23] <ziyadb> Anyway, running now. It's nice enough. Thanks for making it!
