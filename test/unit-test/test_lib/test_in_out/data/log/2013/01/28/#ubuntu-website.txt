[22:32] <daker> rsajdok: it the same error as yesterday ?
[22:34] <daker> try to delete the db then run make db again
[22:34] <daker> rsajdok: ^
[22:36] <rsajdok|a> daker: Yes, the same error
[22:37] <rsajdok|a> Delete dB do not resolve problem
[22:37] <daker> rsajdok|a: ./env/bin/python loco_directory/manage.py syncdb
[22:37] <daker> then
[22:37] <daker> ./env/bin/python loco_directory/manage.py migrate
[22:39] <rsajdok|a> Ok, I will try tomorrow, goodnight
[22:42] <daker> ok
[22:55] <daker> rsajdok|a: i have a fix for it https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ltp-devs/loco-team-portal/0.2/revision/601
[22:55] <daker> just don't create the superuser when doing the sync
