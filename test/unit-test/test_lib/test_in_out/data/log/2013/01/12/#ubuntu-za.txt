[06:25] <nlsthzn> Mornign all
[06:25] <nlsthzn> Morning even
[06:27] <Kilos> morning all
[06:27] <nlsthzn> good morning uncle Kilos 
[06:28] <Kilos> hi nlsthzn wassup with the gaming
[06:29] <Kilos> get help with the dual screens
[06:29] <nlsthzn> like I said in the mail, I don't have an Ubuntu gaming system at the moment cause I can't get all my hardware to work with Linux :/
[06:29] <Kilos> aw
[06:30] <nlsthzn> lost a whole day yesterday fiddling with it in my ignorance :p
[06:31] <Kilos> whew
[06:48] <Kilos> i dont know where the guys will find time anyway
[06:49] <nlsthzn> my biggest issue too :(
[06:50] <Kilos> unless you play chess without timers
[06:50] <Kilos> hehe
[06:50] <magespawn> good morning 
[06:50] <Kilos> hi magespawn 
[06:51] <magespawn> good morning ?
[06:51] <magespawn> whats up?
[06:51] <magespawn> do not know where the 2nd good morning came from
[06:51] <Kilos> still no rain and spitting dust here
[06:52] <magespawn> typo gremlins already awake
[06:52] <magespawn> anything predicted?
[06:52] <Kilos> lol i wondered about that had to look if my hi went through
[06:53] <Kilos> ya 60% heavy last night and today but sun shining happily
[06:53] <magespawn> go do a rain dance
[06:53] <Kilos> lol
[06:54] <Kilos> thats what i said to the pro yesterday
[06:57] <magespawn> nlsthzn: can you choose hardware that will work or is there always a problem?
[07:15] <magespawn> Kilos how are the sheep holding up?
[07:17] <Kilos> sheep love dry weather magespawn like in the karoo
[07:17] <magespawn> well that good, the ones down here are taking strain
[07:17] <Kilos> and there is lotsa grass and weeds so they got plenty food
[07:18] <Kilos> strain from the rain?
[07:18] <magespawn> none of the dangerous weeds?
[07:18] <Kilos> i think i got rid of the few bad ones that were here
[07:19] <Kilos> over the years
[07:20] <magespawn> the tick load for animals down here when it is wet is too much for the sheep
[07:20] <Kilos> think
[07:20] <Kilos> ah
[07:20] <Kilos> yeah
[07:20] <Kilos> its rather expensive to dip but that helps
[07:21] <Kilos> once a month or 2 in the summer
[07:21] <Kilos> also drops the tick population
[07:21] <magespawn> the parasites are okay to deal with, takes time, but the secondary infections, fungus and such are madness
[07:22] <Kilos> fungus as in foot rot?
[07:23] <magespawn> and internal fungus, makes the area swell up
[07:23] <Kilos> ivomec injections under the skin in inner thigh
[07:24] <magespawn> got a new name for the channel
[07:24] <Kilos> anyone of the ivomectins will do
[07:24] <Kilos> lol
[07:24] <magespawn> #ubuntu-za-vet
[07:25] <magespawn> yeah there is treatment, but hectic on the time, effort and money
[07:25] <Kilos> also another similar product called trodex
[07:25] <Kilos> nothing is cheap anymore
[07:26] <magespawn> yup and in zululand you seem to need everything to just get normal growth and production
[07:26] <Kilos> i looked at that matrix site to see what it would cost to build up a fast pc
[07:26] <Kilos> whew
[07:27] <Kilos> the cpus are expensive
[07:27] <Kilos> i saving bit by bit to get a socket 1155 mb i think it is
[07:27] <magespawn> yup when you start looking at the i7, they can cost as much a whole normal pc
[07:27] <Kilos> like the one cantide got
[07:28] <Kilos> even i3 is faster that a P4 hey?
[07:28] <Kilos> the nice part is them mb's take ddr3 ram
[07:29] <magespawn> the newer chips have multiple cores so they run at the same Ghz but process two lots of commands at the same time
[07:29] <Tonberry> i5 is plenty fast
[07:30] <Kilos> yeah i wanted to get a core2 cpu for here and ian said rather go bit by bit and get the other mb
[07:30] <Kilos> i5 and i7 cpus cost big bucks Tonberry 
[07:31] <Kilos> i go see the i5 price
[07:31] <Tonberry> 2500ish is the sweetspot 
[07:31] <Kilos> eek
[07:31] <Kilos> i want to build the whole thing for 2k or less
[07:32] <Kilos> still gotta get data monthly
[07:32] <Tonberry> 2k for a pc is pushing it
[07:32] <Tonberry> not impossible
[07:32] <nlsthzn> core2quad still kick butt
[07:32] <Tonberry> if you can find one
[07:32] <nlsthzn> my wife still using my Q6600 and it works fine
[07:33] <nlsthzn> got to go second hand
[07:33]  * Tonberry is a speedfreak
[07:33]  * nlsthzn is rocking an i7 too :p
[07:39] <Kilos> http://www.matrixonlineshop.co.za/Shop/
[07:40] <Kilos> if you look at specials there lotsa expensive stuff
[07:41] <Kilos> left bottom corner is mb's and cpu's\
[07:44] <nlsthzn> when I was in SA I always bought from http://sybaritic.co.za/store/
[07:44] <nlsthzn> and my one system I got from http://www.pcint.co.za/
[07:47] <Kilos> will look at them too ty nlsthzn

[09:00] <Kilos> i thought so
[09:00] <Kilos> the bot needs to go back to school
[09:02] <magespawn> need a teacher bot then 
[09:05] <Kilos> invaluable meets very valuable
[09:05] <Kilos> crazy mixed up language
[09:08] <magespawn> in the latest full circle mag there is a walk through of the LPIC-1 
[09:09] <Kilos> download link please 
[09:11] <magespawn> just a sec
[09:11] <Kilos> no rush
[09:11] <magespawn> looks like it is going to a series of articles
[09:12] <magespawn> http://fullcirclemagazine.org/issue-68/
[09:12] <Kilos> ty magespawn 
[09:12] <magespawn> np
[09:14] <magespawn> superfly have you tried airdroid?
[09:21] <nlsthzn> airdroid is awesome
[09:22] <inetpro> Maaz: define unvaluable
[09:22] <Maaz> inetpro: Unvaluable \Un*val"u*a*ble\, a. 1. Invaluable; being beyond price. [Obs.] --South. [1913 Webster]  2. Not valuable; having little value. [R.] --T. Adams. [1913 Webster]
[09:22] <nlsthzn> so it has two oppisite meanings, lovely
[09:23] <inetpro> hmm... not exactly what I understand from that
[09:23] <inetpro> being beyond price
[09:24] <nlsthzn> 1. = very very valuable, 2 = no value
[09:24] <inetpro> nlsthzn: where does it say that?
[09:24] <nlsthzn> if something is priceless it is .... ?
[09:24] <Kilos> 2
[09:24] <inetpro> very very valuable is valuable
[09:25] <Kilos> un is normally the opposite of something
[09:25] <Kilos> thats 1 invaluable
[09:25] <inetpro> unvaluable is 'not valuable'
[09:25] <nlsthzn> Maaz, define invaluable
[09:25] <Kilos> ya
[09:25] <Maaz> nlsthzn: Invaluable \In*val"u*a*ble\, a. Valuable beyond estimation; inestimable; priceless; precious. [1913 Webster], invaluable adj 1: having incalculable monetary, intellectual, or spiritual worth [syn: {invaluable}, {priceless}]
[09:26] <inetpro> unvaluable
[09:26] <inetpro> :-)
[09:26] <Kilos> hehe
[09:26] <Kilos> i had actually never heard it used before
[09:26] <inetpro> makes sense to me
[09:27] <inetpro> Maaz: define valuable
[09:27] <Maaz> inetpro: Valuable \Val"u*a*ble\, a. 1. Having value or worth; possessing qualities which are useful and esteemed; precious; costly; as, a valuable horse; valuable land; a valuable cargo. [1913 Webster]  2. Worthy; estimable; deserving esteem; as, a valuable friend; a valuable companion. [1913 Webster]  {Valuable consideration} (Law), an equivalent or compensation
[09:27] <Maaz> having value given for a thing purchased, as money, marriage, services, etc. --Blackstone.…
[09:28] <inetpro> hmm...
[09:28] <nlsthzn> the definition for unvaluable given by maaz is oppsosite of each other 
[09:29] <magespawn> maybe maaz needs a proper dictionary like oxford
[09:31] <zeref> herro ubuntu-za
[09:32] <inetpro> magespawn: what does the oxford dictionary say about unvaluable
[09:32] <inetpro> ?
[09:32] <zeref> invaluable?
[09:32] <Kilos> i cant find it in my old one
[09:32] <magespawn> not sure
[09:32] <magespawn> brb
[09:32]  * magespawn goes to get a dictionary
[09:33] <nlsthzn> Un`val´u`a`ble
[09:33] <nlsthzn> a.	1.	Invaluable; being beyond price.
[09:33] <nlsthzn> 2.	Not valuable; having little value.
[09:33] <nlsthzn> Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, published 1913 by C. & G. Merriam Co.
[09:33] <nlsthzn> great, same one as Maaz :/
[09:34] <nlsthzn> seems unvaluable in the sense of invaluable is an American thing (from some stuff I read online)
[09:36] <inetpro> according to http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/unvaluable - unvaluable - The word you've entered isn't in the thesaurus. Click on a spelling suggestion below or try again using the search bar above.
[09:37] <inetpro> very interesting
[09:37] <magespawn> no such word according to http://oxforddictionaries.com/spellcheck/english/?q=unvaluable
[09:38] <nlsthzn> google also tries and corrects it to invaluable :p
[09:38] <Kilos> hehe
[09:38] <Kilos> i may be stupid but i'm not a fool
[09:38] <inetpro> haha
[09:38] <Kilos> but the yanks have warped many english words over the years
[09:39] <Kilos> and peeps everywhere learn it from tv
[09:39] <magespawn> and done away with lots of others
[09:39] <inetpro> http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/unvaluable
[09:39] <inetpro> that ^^ has it
[09:40] <tumbleweed> I'd suggest valueless over unvaluable, though
[09:40] <Kilos> yip tumbleweed 
[09:40] <inetpro> I agree that it is somewhat confusing
[09:40] <magespawn> isn't collins also american?
[09:41] <tumbleweed> unvaluable isn't commonly used
[09:41] <inetpro> but I can understand how they got to derive the meaning 'not valuable'
[09:41] <inetpro> un = not
[09:41] <magespawn> and if you write programmes it can create interesting results
[09:41] <Kilos> un is an opposite of a word
[09:41] <Kilos> like unlike
[09:41] <Kilos> etc
[09:42] <nlsthzn> and uncle
[09:42] <tumbleweed> so is in-, most of the time
[09:42] <inetpro> unlike = not like
[09:42] <Kilos> lol @ nlsthzn 
[09:42] <tumbleweed> English doesn't like hard rules
[09:42] <inetpro> roflol
[09:42] <Kilos> yip incurable is not curable
[09:43] <nlsthzn> so un = not except when it doesn't
[09:43] <inetpro> you guys are classic!
[09:44] <Kilos> languages are interesting
[09:44] <Kilos> afr has funny words too
[09:44] <inetpro> Kilos: very!
[09:45] <Kilos> our black backed jackal is n witrug jakals
[09:45] <inetpro> Kilos: why?
[09:45] <magespawn> inflammable
[09:45] <Kilos> the van der merwe that named them must been colour blind
[09:46] <Kilos> yip magespawn thats very flammable
[09:46] <Kilos> weird hey why not just say flamable
[09:47] <inetpro> wow, that is weird yes
[09:49] <Kilos> thats why peeps that speak other languages battle with english
[09:49] <Kilos> one needs to grow up with it
[09:49] <magespawn> have tried mandarin?
[09:50] <Kilos> and then still need dictionary now and again
[09:55] <inetpro> Flammable and inflammable both mean capable of burning. The word "inflammable" came from Latin inflammāre = "to set fire to," where the prefix "in-" means "in" as in "indoctrinate", rather than "not" as in "invisible" and "ineligible".
[09:56] <inetpro> comes from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammable#Linguistics:_flammable_vs._inflammable
[09:56] <Kilos> whew
[09:57] <nlsthzn> nice find
[09:58] <Kilos> i shoulda kept quiet
[09:58] <magespawn> #ubuntu-za-language
[09:59] <Kilos> was easier just to know what inflammable meant not that the latins gave us its root
[09:59] <Kilos> as in so many other words
[09:59] <Kilos> attilla shoulda wiped them
[10:00] <magespawn> think it was a bit late then, they had already influenced the language
[10:00] <magespawn> brb
[10:02]  * inetpro lol at @ Kilos
[10:09] <magespawn> back
[10:19] <magespawn> man the networking in win is retarded
[10:21] <Kilos> along with everything else
[10:22] <magespawn> this in particular is getting in my way today

[10:23] <superfly> afternoon boys and girls

[12:12] <magespawn> zeref: have you used synergy before?
[12:12] <zeref> so what i did over that the past 4 days is that: the problem started when i pressed crtl+ alt + f1
[12:12] <zeref> then the screen turned off
[12:12] <zeref> .
[12:12] <zeref> so after a couple of days
[12:13] <zeref> I disconnected the powerf
[12:13] <zeref> * power
[12:13] <zeref> the today
[12:13] <zeref> *then
[12:14] <Kilos> i need to know more about the server 
[12:14] <Kilos> what all is in that flat box
[12:14] <Kilos> i got a whole pc as a server
[12:14] <zeref>  I pressed the power button and connected  the power whilst pressing the power button
[12:15] <zeref> and it switched on
[12:15] <zeref> :-(
[12:15] <zeref> :-)
[12:15] <Kilos> thats a weird prob you cause there
[12:15] <Kilos> no more ctrl+alt+f1
[12:15] <zeref> magespawn:  I've synergy before
[12:15] <zeref> what is it?
[12:15] <zeref> Kilos: indeed
[12:16] <Kilos> it should go to text interface i think
[12:16] <Kilos> like f2
[12:16] <Kilos> the guys will know
[12:16] <zeref> k, i think  i should write a tut on that
[12:17] <magespawn> allows you to control one or more pc with onely one keyboard and mouse
[12:18] <magespawn> have not tried it on a server though only gui systems
[12:19] <zeref> ok.
[12:20] <zeref> so do crtl + alt + f1
[12:20] <zeref> affect the screen
[12:34] <Kilos> im scared to try
[12:45] <sakhi> funny I can only ssh to my servers via port 22 when I change the port to something else like 65534  it doesn't work...hmmm I'm not using ports numbers lower than 1024
[12:48] <zeref> sakhi: shouldn't you change your port numbers on the  server
[12:49] <sakhi> yes I have changed in on the server
[12:51] <sakhi> I have a session on the server made the changes on the ssh config file when I ssh from my laptop it doesn't work however when I revert back to port 22 on the server it works...I'm thinking it could be fw perhaps.
[12:56] <tumbleweed> I'd guess so
[12:59] <sakhi> anyone heard of Moroccan Ghost? bunch of people going around defacing websites, I was a victim. Seems like the use a file injection attack especially on php sites.
[13:01] <superfly> sakhi: what was your site running?
[13:01] <superfly> Drupal? WordPress? Joomla?
[13:01] <sakhi> Chisimba its an inhouse cms
[13:01] <superfly> oh right, yes I know Chisimba
[13:02] <superfly> had a look at it and went running straight back to Drupal
[13:02] <sakhi> its going to phased out due to "professional" support prof.=M$
[13:03] <sakhi> I don't blame you its well written and the idea behind it great however it lacks support.
[13:05] <superfly> no, I looked at the code and found it awful
[13:06] <sakhi> lots of coding last I checked it was more than 200k lines
[13:16] <magespawn> sakhi: did they not get to a bunch of sa government sites too?
[13:23] <sakhi> magespawn: yes they also did.
[13:23] <sakhi> and other sites which are not Govt. most are Govt.
[13:24] <magespawn> seems like a strange thing to do, what do they gain from it?
[13:27] <sakhi> bunch of kids wasting peoples time...I mean really if you wanted to cause harm why go for sites instead of business systems...no idea what they gain from it.
[13:28] <magespawn> one of the unknown things about the internet

[17:28] <inetpro> superfly: what is swamprats?

[17:28] <Kilos> ok now i go eat after weatherman lies some more
[17:29] <superfly> swamprats are rats that live in swamps
[17:29] <superfly> and ROUSes are Rodents Of Unusual Size
[17:29] <Kilos> thats the natallers
[17:29] <superfly> inetpro: you need to watch The Princess Bride - there seems to be a gap in your education
[17:29] <Kilos> wbb
[17:30] <superfly> inetpro: I thought they were dubbeltjies, not bubbeltjies
[17:30] <inetpro> superfly: yes dubbeltjies
[17:31] <inetpro> and for the gap in my education?
[17:31] <inetpro> hmm...
[17:31]  * inetpro doesn't know about that
[17:34] <superfly> inetpro: exactly, if you don't know about The Princess Bride, then there's a gap!
[17:35] <inetpro> superfly: but I don't know about it
[17:38] <superfly> inetpro: so then I recommend finding it, and watching it! Then you can join thousands of others world wide who seek to continue the meme
[17:38] <inetpro> lol
[17:38] <superfly> And you'll understand a number of quips that arise in geekdom
[17:39] <superfly> too many references to that movie
[17:39] <inetpro> the gap is already filled with may other things
[17:39] <inetpro> to many other things*
[17:39] <superfly> inetpro: if it isn't the princess bride, then it's not worth it! :-P
[17:39] <inetpro> ok superfly, is it good for kiddies as well?
[17:40] <superfly> inetpro: mostly, yes
[17:40] <inetpro> hmm....
[17:40] <superfly> inetpro: how old are yours?
[17:40] <inetpro> superfly: between 7 and 15
[17:41] <superfly> that should be fine. I think there are one or two intense scenes in the movie which might scare younger kids
[17:42] <superfly> my eldest has watched it though, and he wasn't worried
[17:42] <superfly> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/
[17:44] <superfly> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYgcrny2hRs
[17:45] <inetpro> looks intriguing
[17:48] <Kilos> oh my i see what the fly is getting at
[17:49] <inetpro> Kilos: please tell
[17:49] <Kilos> s/bubbeltjies/dubbeltjies
[17:49] <Kilos> sorry man
[17:49] <inetpro> ai!
[17:49] <superfly> there's one scene where one of the guys is strapped to a table and his life is "sucked" out of him, which is rather intense, and there's another scene where two guys fight with swords and knives and there's a fair amount of blood (but no gore)
[17:49]  * inetpro thought that was intentional
[17:49] <Kilos> wait im catching up
[17:50] <inetpro> superfly: I'll try to remember to get it
[17:51] <Kilos> how big is that movie superfly /inet
