=== cpg|away is now known as cpg
[02:10] <Botanic> I created a package and uploaded it to the ppa, I want to test it locally however to make sure I did everything correctly, how can I do that?
[02:18] <sarnold> Botanic: you could add the ppa using apt-add-repository
[02:18] <Botanic> its not built yet
[02:19] <Botanic> itl take like 8-10 hours to be processed
[02:19] <Botanic> id like to test it a bit sooner then that :)
[02:19] <sarnold> oh!
[02:19] <Botanic> as if there is an issue it limits the time I can work on it
[02:19] <sarnold> very much so :) hehe
[02:20] <sarnold> look into 'sbuild' or 'pbuild'; they help recreate the build environment on your machine. neither are perfect, but they do give you some confidence that a build didn't succeed because of some local packages that just happened to be installed.
[02:20] <Botanic> well i know the code is fine, im more concerned with it creating shortcuts properly etc
[02:20] <infinity> hallyn: Well, looks like I mangled enough of the archive to get qemu to migrate to raring.  Next step, removal of qemu-kvm source (which should be simple, now that the only binary it produces is obsolete)
[02:21] <infinity> hallyn: But you definitely need to do something about spice, so we can drop the now un-uploadable qemu-linaro.
=== doko_ is now known as doko
[02:57] <hallyn> infinity: yup.  do you object to a duplicated source of qemu, called qemu-spice, producing the (universe) qemu-kvm-spice package?
[02:58] <hallyn> That would be until either main-universe split is done away with, or spice gets MIR'd
[02:58] <hallyn> infinity: what do you mean by 'get qemu to migrate' to raring?
[02:59] <hallyn> ithought that would happen automativally
[03:00] <infinity> hallyn: Well, I needed to fix some packages with deps on kvm.  And then forcefully whack the kvm binary package.
[03:00] <infinity> hallyn: Also, there are file overlaps in qemu.
[03:00] <infinity> hallyn: (Unrelated, just noticing this now)
[03:00] <infinity> hallyn: Looks like this is inherited from Debian, so not your fault.  But should fix.
[03:01] <infinity> (base)adconrad@cthulhu:~/qemu/qemu-1.3.0+dfsg$ grep doc/qemu/ debian/qemu-system.install
[03:01] <infinity> debian/tmp/usr/share/doc/qemu/qemu-tech.html
[03:01] <infinity> debian/tmp/usr/share/doc/qemu/qemu-doc.html
[03:01] <infinity> debian/tmp/usr/share/doc/qemu/qmp-commands.txt
[03:01] <infinity> ^-- Those three end up in both qemu and qemu-system, which seems silly, since all the other docs in doc/qemu are in qemu, but not system.
[03:02] <infinity> I'm grabbing all the binaries right now to make sure those are the only overlaps.
[03:03] <infinity> hallyn: I was going to JFDI a fix for the file overlaps, but it might be nice to know what the people who wrote that .install file were thinking (ie: is there a reason at all to have those files in the qemu-system package?)
[03:10] <infinity> hallyn: Okay, those are the only overlaps I see (and, actually, only two of those are overlaps, but all three seem silly, given that all the other docs live in qemu.deb)
[03:10] <infinity> hallyn: The quick-and-simple fix would just be to move those to qemu.install instead.  Opinions?  Can you get that into Debian too, so we don't diverge?
[03:11] <infinity> hallyn: Oh, wait.  Then there's also the two overlaps listed explicitle in qemu.docs.  Fail.
[03:12] <infinity> hallyn: So, this could go either way.  I can't tell what people really wanted. :P
[03:12] <infinity> Given that qemu depends on qemu-system anyway, maybe it's easier to remove those from qemu.
[03:12]  * infinity does that.
[03:13] <hallyn> infinity: oops, sorry, yeah, I can push it into Debian.
[03:14] <infinity> Let me test spin this and make sure it gives the result I'm assuming it will.
[03:14]  * infinity sets his laptop on fire with the awful build of awful.
[03:16] <infinity> hallyn: Assuming this test build produces plausibly-populated binaries, you probably want to push both these revisions to experimental: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1550856/
[03:17] <infinity> hallyn: (With an appropriate Closes: in the changelog for the CVE one, the Debian bug is mentioned in the patch header)
[03:19]  * hallyn curses the request for 2factor auth to d/l as text
[03:21] <hallyn> infinity: i'll push it to my github tree and pass it along to the debian team
[03:22] <hallyn> infinity: thanks
[03:24] <infinity> hallyn: And before you ask, there's no need for a Replaces, since dpkg would have never let him install qemu anyway, so it can't own the files.
[03:24] <infinity> hallyn: Anyhow.  Testbuid running just to make sure it DTRT.
[03:24] <infinity> hallyn: The I'll upload.
[03:27] <hallyn> infinity: odd, the patch author is the guy mainly doing the debian qemu tree.
[03:28] <hallyn> oh, no, but the bug submitter
[03:28] <hallyn> oh well
[03:29] <infinity> I do wonder if maybe I have this backward, given that all the other docs are in qemu, not qemu-system.
[03:30] <infinity> Do you have an opinion on where these 3 files should ship?
[03:30] <hallyn> seems to me qemu is just meant to be a meta-package, not ship the docs, so i'd say qemu-system
[03:31] <hallyn> although, what, they apply to qemu-user too?
[03:31] <infinity> Well, that's not currently true.  qemu has a ton of docs.
[03:31] <hallyn> a new qemu-docs pkg? :)
[03:32] <infinity> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1550873/
[03:32] <hallyn> i guess qemu makes sense as you certainly can use qemu-user without qemu-system
[03:32] <infinity> A docs package may not be an awful idea, but I'm thinking for now, I should reverse this patch, and ship those three files in qemu, but not -system, based on the above paste.
[03:33]  * infinity does that.
[03:33] <hallyn> nod
[03:36] <infinity> hallyn: New and improved -- http://paste.ubuntu.com/1550888/
[03:37]  * infinity rebuilds again.
[03:39] <infinity> Only takes 20m to build.  I thought it was worse...
[03:39] <infinity> Maybe someone fixed some parallelisation at some point.
[03:41] <hallyn> the old old qemu-kvm packages didn't parallelize the build at all.  those were painful.
[03:41] <infinity> hallyn: As for the spice thing, I object slightly to a qemu-universe that only generates the spice package, but it's no worse than the situation we've had up until now with qemu-kvm and qemu-linaro.
[03:42] <hallyn> infinity: is there anything else we can do?  how close are we to getting rid of main+universe split?
[03:42] <infinity> hallyn: If you keep them in sync until such a time as it's not needed, it's probably not a big deal.
[03:42] <hallyn> right, i'd take the source from our qemu with the relevant part of the old qemu-linaro packaging, i guess
[03:42] <infinity> hallyn: ArchiveReorg probably won't be done this cycle, so we need a solution for now, whether it's spice in main or a qemu-universe source.
[03:42] <hallyn> (keep it in a separate branch of the same github tree)
[03:42] <infinity> hallyn: Duplicate sources aren't world-ending if they're kept completely in sync, so they're trivial to patch for security and SRU.
[03:43] <infinity> (See, eg: boost and boost-mpi)
[03:49] <hallyn> infinity: (your debdiff pushed to git://github.com/hallyn/qemu)
[03:50]  * hallyn takes a quick looka t spice deps 
[03:52] <infinity> hallyn: Do you keep a Debian branch as well, or just ask people to pull, mangle, and merge?
[03:54] <hallyn> well shoot
[03:54] <hallyn> infinity: i've only just started, so so far i just have asked ppl to look and comment and cherrypick if appropriate
[03:54] <infinity> How/where is it maintained in Debian?
[03:55] <hallyn> spice deps are looking clean !  i may ahve to re-ask for MIR
[03:55] <infinity> Ahh, git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-qemu/qemu.git
[03:55] <hallyn> well, git://anonscm.debian.org/pkg-qemu/qemu.git is what i use, not sure if that's the same
[03:55] <hallyn> assume so
[03:55] <infinity> You should probably just ask to be added to the Alioth group and merge appropriate distro-agnostic changes back yourself.
[03:55] <infinity> Really helps keep the deltas down.
[03:56] <hallyn> infinity: yeah, that'll be best long term, but i'm happy to spend some time slow-tracking to prove myself
[03:56] <infinity> My life got a bazillion times easier when I just sucked it up and started maintaining all our glibc stuff in Debian first.
[03:57] <hallyn> In the meantime we have som ethings we're hashing out in the debian qemu list,
[03:57] <infinity> (Of course, this also led to accidentally being a Debian/glibc maintainer, but I suppose that's not a bad thing)
[03:58]  * hallyn looks up what the heck the alioth group is
[03:58] <infinity> Alright, confirmed that that diff did what I wanted.  Uploading.
[03:59] <infinity> hallyn: pkg-qemu, according to the UNIX perms on git.d.o
[04:00] <hallyn> gotcha
[04:06] <hallyn> all right i'll re-file the MIR for spice, hope for the best
[04:08] <infinity> hallyn: Well, all its build-deps are in main now, that's a good start.
[04:09] <infinity> hallyn: If you can get security to sign off on it, I have no issues with it, personally.
[04:09] <infinity> hallyn: Might want to offer jdstrand or mdeslaur a beer to review it for you.
[04:10] <hallyn> infinity: luckily they won't be horribly overprised copenhagen beers
[04:11] <hallyn> priced even

[19:45] <cjwatson> mlankhorst: good start, thanks
[19:48] <mlankhorst> cjwatson: how much space do you need?
[19:52] <mlankhorst> I'm probably going to compare against the old mesa, and just prevent an increase in size only
[19:56] <cjwatson> mlankhorst: I think we're something like 15MB over target
=== cpg is now known as cpg|away
[19:56] <cjwatson> (vs. 12.04.1, which was just about crowbarred into space)
[19:56] <cjwatson> I haven't checked absolutely current image sizes though
[19:56] <cjwatson> obv. it's not all going to come from mesa, but as much as feasible ...
[19:57] <mlankhorst> yeah but can't get more than 5 mb off probably, unless you want to drop some drivers from the renamed stack
[19:58] <mlankhorst> but most of those are small :/
