[07:57] <Squirm> hello
[07:58] <Kilos> hi Squirm 
[08:25] <magespawn> Kilos did my first solder fix
[08:26] <Kilos> did it go well magespawn 
[08:27] <Kilos> or you forgotten what i told you
[08:28] <Kilos> the secret is all in the correct temp of what you are soldering
[08:28] <magespawn> i copy/pasted that into a test file so i while never forget
[08:28] <Kilos> when temp right solder will flow 
[08:28] <magespawn> yes it went well
[08:28] <Kilos> good
[08:29] <Kilos> should leave a smooth shiny surface without points
[08:31] <magespawn> yup
[08:31] <Kilos> good man
[08:31] <magespawn> am very pleased, as i used to mess it up before
[08:32] <Kilos> you either learn fast or listen well
[08:32] <Kilos> hehe
[08:32] <magespawn> listen well
[08:33] <Kilos> haha
[08:33] <magespawn> probably get cocky now and mess the next one up
[08:34] <Kilos> dust play with joining bits of wire or even with a single pice till you master the temp bit and when to add solder
[08:35] <Kilos> and alsways put some solder on iron tip just before the job so its lekker shiny
[08:36] <barrydk> kap hom vas met 'n warm spyker
[08:36] <Kilos> hehe
[08:41] <Kilos> yo Vince-0

[10:24]  * inetpro voel nou sommer stukke beter
[10:24] <Kilos> hahaha
[10:24] <Symmetria> heh for anyone interested
[10:24] <Symmetria> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2sQSoA3BTg
[10:24] <Symmetria> this dude might be coming to .za
[10:24] <Symmetria> and if he does come out, he's well worth going to watch
[10:25] <Symmetria> because he's fuckin awesome
[10:30] <Kilos> ai Symmetria we bitch at the kids for bad language here then you come do it
[10:30] <Kilos> words like very word too
[10:30] <Kilos> or extremely
[10:32] <Kilos> maybe im wrong
[10:35] <Kilos> s/word/work
[11:29] <mazal> What is the meaning of the /'s here
[11:29] <mazal> I see you guys use it a lot
[11:35] <Squirm> mazal: it's used in vim to replace words
[11:35] <Squirm> basically if the guys make a typo, s/(word with typo)/(the word it should be)
[11:39] <mazal> Ah ok , ta Squirm 
[11:40] <Squirm> mazal: it's nothing really, just a geeky representation of a typo correction :P
[11:44] <Kilos> i dunno but it means you replace the mistake with the right word
[11:44] <Kilos> or spelling
[11:44] <Kilos> aw ty Squirm 
[11:45] <Kilos> sholda read all first
[11:45] <Kilos> s/sholda/shoulda
[11:45] <Kilos> sjoe
[11:45] <Kilos> shouda
[11:45] <Kilos> whatever
[11:51] <inetpro> Kilos: there's another slash missing
[11:51] <inetpro> should be s/sholda/shoulda/
[11:51] <Kilos> whew
[11:51] <inetpro> comes from sed
[11:51] <inetpro> man sed
[11:52] <Kilos> no man man dont like me
[11:52] <Kilos> looked at man modprobe for an hour
[11:52] <Kilos> but ty for the info
[11:52] <Squirm> lol
[11:52] <Squirm> man is quite handy
[11:52] <Squirm> I've used s// in vim
[11:53] <inetpro> http://www.brunolinux.com/02-The_Terminal/Find_and%20Replace_with_Sed.html
[11:53] <inetpro> that ^^ is only one of many other places with examples
[11:54] <inetpro> perl has the same thing
[11:54] <Squirm> yeah
[11:55] <Squirm> :s/foo/bar/g	 Change each 'foo' to 'bar' in the current line.
[11:55] <Squirm> ok, similat
[11:55] <Squirm> similar
[11:55] <inetpro> it's easier to type it like that than saying, damn I made a mistake and "this" should have been "that"
[11:55] <Squirm> in vim
[11:55] <Squirm> inetpro: I used to use *
[11:55] <Squirm> so
[11:55] <Squirm> similar*
[11:55] <inetpro> horses for sourses
[11:56] <inetpro> courses*
[11:56] <Kilos> mazal, you watching
[11:56] <Kilos> sed says maak so
[11:56] <mazal> even is still the easiest
[11:57] <Kilos> lol
[11:57] <mazal> Just the correct word and even
[11:59] <mazal> Sjoe that sed seems powerful 
[11:59] <mazal> Was looking at that link now
[12:16] <magespawn> very useful
[12:22] <Squirm> I need to learn sed and awk
[12:34] <magespawn> awk awk awk said the bird
[12:40] <Squirm> awk awk awk sed the bird
[12:40] <Squirm> @ magespawn 
[12:41] <magespawn> indeed
[12:41] <inetpro> ai!
[13:08] <Kilos> wat ai jy al weer inetpro ?
[13:08] <Kilos> that was clever
[13:08] <Kilos> Squirm, not as look as dumb he be
[13:08] <inetpro> Kilos: guys making fun of my awk and sed
[13:09] <Kilos> haha
[13:09] <Kilos> hes gonna learn it man
[13:09] <inetpro> :-)
[13:12] <magespawn> and so will i
[13:12] <Kilos> good boys
[13:12] <magespawn> hey i have just been given a AMD 2GHz with 500mb of ram, i am taking nominations for the choice of os

[16:45] <Squirm> it doesn't stop talking
[16:45] <Mezenir> lol
[16:45] <Squirm> in this high pitched voice
[16:46] <Kilos> we got an african grey that never shuts up till its cage is covered at night
[16:46] <Mezenir> i had a flatmate with a parrot
[16:46] <Mezenir> kept imitating the door bell
[16:46] <Squirm> I was house sitting one weekend. I was sitting there at about 10pm watching TV and all I here is this "sowubona"
[16:47] <Squirm> well I got a bit of a fright
[16:47] <Squirm> peeked out the window, opened the door- nothing
[16:47] <Kilos> this one does fone ring tones and adida noises and calls the one dog and more
[16:47] <Squirm> realised it was the african grey
[16:47] <Kilos> hahaha they talk well hey
[16:48] <Kilos> bark like digs and all kinds off things
[16:48] <Squirm> I've never heard a dig bark

[16:49] <Kilos> s/dig/dog/
[16:49] <inetpro> Kilos: nee
[16:49] <inetpro> s/dig/dog/g
[16:50] <Kilos> ai!
[16:50] <inetpro> that replaces all instances 
[16:50] <inetpro> in other words globally
[16:50] <inetpro> :-)
[16:50] <Kilos> inetpro> should be s/sholda/shoulda/
[16:50] <inetpro> lol
[16:50] <Kilos> where the extra g comes from now
[16:51] <Kilos> oh my
[16:51] <Squirm> g = global
[16:51] <Squirm> so it would replace all the mispelt words
[16:52]  * Squirm tries Dota 2 on wine
[16:55] <Kilos> what old dos games are worth playing? i see they got DOSBox Is Project of the Month at sourceforge
[16:55] <Squirm> don't think I've played any dos games
[16:55] <Kilos> games only came alive after windows didnt they
[16:56] <Squirm> ooh, Steam started
[16:58] <Mezenir> i played my fair share of dos games

[17:00] <inetpro> all on the cli
[17:07] <inetpro> google's search has really gone backwards for me
[17:08] <inetpro> rather than getting technical documentation I get books and useless other results these days
[17:17] <Mezenir> mmm
[17:17] <Mezenir> i know google has a /linux page
[17:18] <Mezenir> probably something similar for technical searches
[17:18] <Mezenir> to refine it
[17:18] <Mezenir> might help
[17:19] <Mezenir> wait
[17:19] <Mezenir> i just googled it
[17:19] <Mezenir> and it no longer exists :P
[17:19] <Mezenir> my bad
[17:20] <Mezenir> "These services were established many years ago to offer search across a limited index of the Web, which in the past was a better way to find this information. For example, google.com/linux was designed to help people find information from message boards and blogs about the Linux operating system," Google explained.
[17:20] <Mezenir> "Today, search quality has advanced tremendously, and based on our analysis we've found that in most cases you're better off looking for this kind of specialized information using the regular Google search box, for example by typing [linux fedora upgrade]," the company said.
[17:45]  * inetpro found his problem
[17:46] <inetpro> was the default firefox search engine
[17:46] <inetpro> was pointing to south african searches 
[17:47] <Kilos> i get that when i try go google.com. opera keeps wanting to show google.co.za
[17:47] <Kilos> stupid thing
[17:59] <inetpro> Kilos: actually easy to fix when you know about it
[18:00] <Kilos> how did you "know" about it?
[18:00] <inetpro> I'm not sure whether it was changed with a firefox upgrade but I thought I had fixed it before
[18:01] <Kilos> oh maybe opera too with last upgrade
[18:01] <inetpro> easy to spot in firefox when you look at the search box
[18:01] <Kilos> oh my
[18:01] <inetpro> click on the dropdown and choose your search engine of choice
[18:02] <inetpro> south african search is almost never what I want there
[18:02] <Squirm> Deloitte predicts that over 90% of user-generated passwords, even those considered strong by IT departments, will be vulnerable to hacking.
[18:03] <Squirm> for one, it's cracking
[18:03] <Squirm> :p
[18:03] <inetpro> Squirm: they want to make money again?
[18:03] <inetpro> Squirm: and I agree
[18:03] <inetpro> with you about the cracking, that is
[18:04] <inetpro> 90% is a very high figure
[18:04] <Squirm> it is
[18:04] <Kilos> all windows peeps call peeps hackers
[18:04] <Kilos> they dunno what crackers are
[18:04] <Squirm> hackers and crackers are different
[18:04] <Kilos> think its something you feed the parrot
[18:05] <Kilos> crackers are bad guys right?
[18:05] <Squirm> every second person with some IT knowledge could probably find a program that would crack passwords
[18:05] <Squirm> Kilos: crackers force themselves into system, say by means of something like brute force 
[18:06] <Squirm> a hacker finds loopholes in certain programs and uses them to his advantage
[18:06] <inetpro> Squirm: oh and 90% of facebook account passwords are probably the same as the corporate aacount password
[18:06] <Squirm> so I'd say technically speaking a hacker isn't necessarily bad
[18:06] <Squirm> inetpro: crack into Facebook and coila
[18:06] <Squirm> voila
[18:07] <Kilos> hackers are also guys that fix sortwåre programs right?
[18:07] <Squirm> inetpro: 90% of people would use the same password for everything
[18:07] <Squirm> actually, I'd raise that to 99.9%
[18:07] <inetpro> or twitter or linked in or linked out, etc
[18:07] <Squirm> Kilos: a hacker will find the vulnerability of software
[18:08] <Kilos> so the bad guys are hackers or crackers?
[18:08]  * inetpro is a hacker 
[18:08] <Squirm> both
[18:08] <Kilos> eeek
[18:08] <inetpro> Kilos: the crackers are typically the bad guys
[18:09] <Squirm> yeah
[18:09] <Kilos> thats what i thought inetpro 
[18:09] <inetpro> but there are even more than just that
[18:09] <Squirm> but then you also get the penetration testers, I guess the wrong word that people use, "ethical hacker"
[18:09] <Cantide> white-hat hackers?
[18:10] <Squirm> or that
[18:11] <inetpro>  White hat,  Black hat,  Grey hat,  Elite hacker,  Script kiddie, Neophyte, Blue hat, Hacktivist, etc
[18:11] <Kilos> inetpro, doesn wear a hat
[18:11] <Kilos> s/doesn/doesnt/g
[18:11] <Kilos> hehe
[18:12] <Cantide> Gandalf is a grey hat hacker?

[18:18] <Kilos> inetpro, looks like my prob was ram needing reseating
[18:18] <Kilos> no reboots today
[18:18] <Kilos> remind me to thank the monkey please
[18:19] <inetpro> Kilos: ask maaz to tell him
[18:19] <Kilos> oh ya ty
[18:19] <inetpro> that is good news
[18:20] <Kilos> Maaz, tell kbmonkey on freenode TY lad. reseating ram seems to have sorted the rebooting
[18:20] <Maaz> Kilos: Got it, I'll tell kbmonkey on freenode
[18:20] <inetpro> glad that it was as easy as that
[18:20] <inetpro> sounds like my mouse that didn't want to middle-click
[18:20] <superfly> in old computer lore, a hacker was a really good programmer
[18:20] <superfly> ugh, cat hair EVERYWHERE now
[18:20] <inetpro> just removed battery and put it back and voila, all working again
[18:21] <Kilos> eeek
[18:21] <Squirm> lol superfly, you said that word programming, then the word 'cat' then I read hair EVERYWHERE and I was so confused
[18:21] <Kilos> you lucky inetpro 
[18:21] <inetpro> superfly: I would say that's a very narrow description of a hacker
[18:21] <Squirm> took me a second to realise it wasn't a command :/
