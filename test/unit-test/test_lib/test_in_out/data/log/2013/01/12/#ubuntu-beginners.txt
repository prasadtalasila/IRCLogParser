[14:36] <mkv> Hello, i recently installed medibuntu and the w32codecs, but since then I cant play mkv anymore, and for some videos the time seems to be crooked, any help, how to fix this ?
[14:36] <mkv> its lucid, i know i will upgrade soon
[14:37] <xiaoy> mkv install vlc and see if you can play mkv vids with that
[14:37] <mkv> i already have this installed, it used to play it w/o problems, but since i installed the above, nothing happens, thx for helping
[14:39] <mkv> maybe, uninstall and reinstall?
[14:42] <xiaoy> maybe just unistall
[14:43] <xiaoy> mkv, just remove th epkg
[14:43] <mkv> what is the epkg?
[14:44] <xiaoy> *the package
[14:46] <mkv> well the problem is that i tried several things (medibuntu, w32codecs) before i installed smplayer, then i could play wmvs (i did the changes because there was a wmv that i couldnt play, otherwmvs were playble)
[14:47] <mkv> smplayer seemed the solution for this wmv i couldnt play
[14:47] <mkv> but it crooked mkv playing i guess
[14:48] <mkv> reinstall vlc was no good, i now tried
[14:53] <mkv> movie player gives "could not determine type of stream"
[15:20] <xiaoy> mkv, upgrade and should work everything
[15:21] <mkv> xiaoy, i will make some backup before, but i want to  watch mkvs now not later
[15:21] <xiaoy> sudo apt-get autoremove w32codecs
[15:21] <mkv>  xiaoy,  xiaoy, http://www.pixhost.org/show/2019/15562551_screenshot-software-sources.png , medibuntu is what i enabled?
[15:22] <xiaoy> yes i see
[15:22] <mkv> xiaoy, i will try this, the apt-get update?
[15:22] <mkv> *then
[15:23] <xiaoy> apt-get update will refresh the pkgs list
[15:23] <xiaoy> do it
[15:23] <mkv> what first?
[15:23] <xiaoy> apt-get update -> sudo apt-get autoremove w32codecs
[15:24] <xiaoy> listen, apt-get update has nothing to much to do with the remove stuff
