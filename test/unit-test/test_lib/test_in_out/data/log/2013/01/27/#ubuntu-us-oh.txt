[02:16] <skellat> Well, that was a trip to Cleveland.  A trip down Union Avenue from Slavic Village on the way to Shaker Heights just was not amusing.
[02:18] <_bbb> heh
[02:18] <_bbb> colorful part of town
[02:19] <skellat> Not as much as it was 20 years ago
[02:19] <_bbb> i bought house in slavic village 10 years ago
[02:20] <_bbb> but yeah i know that drive well
[02:20] <skellat> That works.  At least the Red Chimney appears to still be open.
[02:21] <_bbb> drove it earlier today even
[02:22] <skellat> Alrighty, I wasn't expecting all those channels to close at once on me
[02:22] <_bbb> i get the potato soup sometimes on weds
[02:22] <_bbb> at the red chimney.. good stuff
[02:23] <skellat> Yep.
[02:23]  * skellat wanders off
