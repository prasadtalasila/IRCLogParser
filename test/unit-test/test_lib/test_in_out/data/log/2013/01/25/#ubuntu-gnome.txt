[02:42] <jbicha> wow, Unity's more broken than I thought with the staging ppa (first time I've ran Unity in a bit)
[02:54] <jbicha> for instance, gnome-control-center displaying off-center is weird
[03:27] <darkxst> what else is broken? (I havent used unity in ages)
[03:31] <jbicha> theming is broken especially for the indicators
[03:31] <jbicha> it looks like gnome-tweak-tool 3.7 crashes if gnome-shell isn't running
[03:32] <darkxst> tweak tool has never worked when shell is not running
[03:32] <jbicha> it used to, I believe it does in quantal too
[03:33] <jbicha> and of course, gnome-settings-daemon and gnome-control-center have all sorts of regressions
[03:35] <darkxst> well that is too be expected
[03:38] <jbicha> any way I'm back in gnome-shell because those aren't really my bugs to fix, except I should report the off-center g-c-c & the tweak tool crash
[09:30] <darkxst> ricotz, you seeing any leaks with js188/g-s stack?
[11:22] <ricotz> darkxst, i don't notice ones, but i am not running my sessions or g-s very long
