[14:41] <rigved> hi everyone.
[14:41] <rigved> i was thinking of trying to rebuild the raring build to resize the image for my 32 GB tablet.
[14:42] <rigved> till now, i have found this: http://www.mattfischer.com/blog/?p=285
[14:42] <rigved> but it says that the process has changed for 13.04
[14:42] <rigved> could anyone help me with the changed process?
[14:43] <Tassadar> well, the process is more or less the same, but the 32gb image will not flash because it is too big
[14:44] <Tassadar> do you have some custom recovery installed on your n7? (if you don't know what that is, you don't have it)
[14:44] <achiang> ogra_: hi
[14:45] <ogra_> achiang, any idea what we plan wrt the weekly n7 meetings ?
[14:45] <ogra_> i was asked by a few people now if we stopped working on n7 because there are no status infos anymore :)
[14:47] <ogra_> rigved, install android-fsutils, unpack the image with smig3img, loop mount it, copy the tarball to a temporary dir and use make_ext4fs with your preferred size to create a new rootfs image
[14:47] <achiang> ogra_: we should do them again
[14:47] <achiang> ogra_: i've just been maxed out lately
[14:47] <ogra_> *simg2img
[14:48] <ogra_> achiang, k, just wanted to know the plans, thx
[14:50] <rigved> Tassadar: no, i do not have any custom recovery installed (i do not know what that means ;) )
[14:50] <Tassadar> okay, then do what ogra says :)
[14:51] <rigved> ogra_: ok. i am following your instructions now.
[14:51] <rigved> Tassadar, ogra_: thanks. will revert back with status.
[15:57] <jpastore> hola, i have a beaglebone running ubuntu arm 12.04 and I'm getting an error trying to install or update packages via apt-get. followed some howto's on trying to resolve it to no avail
[15:58] <ogra_> can you pastebin the error ?
[15:58] <jpastore> sure 1 sec
[16:00] <jpastore> ogra_, http://pastebin.com/i3cypqxY
[16:03] <ogra_> sudo cp /var/backups/dpkg.status.0 /var/lib/dpkg/status
[16:03] <ogra_> and trz again
[16:03] <ogra_> *try
[16:04] <ogra_> also check dmesg for filesystem errors etc, that database doesnt break on its own usually
[16:05] <jpastore> ok
[16:06] <jpastore> ogra_, same fail
[16:07] <ogra_> hmm, did you take a look at /var/lib/dpkg/status ?
[16:07] <ogra_> its a text file
[16:16] <jpastore> ogra_, yea but it looks like a tab delimited file that i can't make sense of...
[16:16] <jpastore> it look structured and ok...consistent...but i don't know what the values mean and their relevance
[16:16] <ogra_> it should just be package descriptions plus their status
[16:17] <ogra_> you can try moving the file out of the way for a test (and touch an empty one in place)
[16:18] <jpastore> ogra_, ok i think I tried this in a how to, but let me try again following your instructions...i can't talk to a howto =)
[16:18] <ogra_> heh
[16:21] <jpastore> ogra_, hmm...update ran with no error or updates...
[16:22] <jpastore> going to try and install some stuff...thanks for the help. i appreciate it. have a good day!

[17:15] <plars> xnox, ogra_: back before the holidays, we were discussing how to preseed the install on nexus7. Any ideas on this? nothing I've tried so far has worked.
[17:22] <xnox> plars: well on the kde active blog, they use adb to change kernel command line. I wonder if we can abuse that for preseeding nexus7
[17:22] <xnox> but I still didn't check if end-user oem-config can at all be preseeded or not.
[17:23] <plars> xnox: I've slept since then, but I think I tried setting a few options that way without any luck
[17:24] <plars> xnox: then I tried copying the image to the device before starting the first boot, and I also tried inserting it in the initrd.  Neither worked for me so far but it's entirely possible that I'm just missing something
[17:24] <plars> xnox: You had mentioned that you were going to check that, and I was wanting to get some confirmation that I wasn't trying something here that simply isn't possible
[17:25] <xnox> ah. that's what happened.
[17:25] <xnox> Ok. I have one more oem-config bug to check, I guess my next install will be oem-config.
[17:45] <jodh`> ogra_: is ureadahead on arm affected by bug 1085766?
[17:45] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1085766 in ureadahead (Ubuntu) "/var/log/upstart/ureadahead.log contains garbage" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1085766
[18:26] <rigved> Tassadar: ok. you are right. it seems that the 27G image is not being flashed. been waiting for too long.
[18:29] <Tassadar> what size is the image? like the .img file?
[18:29] <rigved> i was reading up on the multi-boot method. it involves a custom recovery. why did you ask me about it earlier? will i be able to flash, say a 13G image on to it using that method?
[18:29] <Tassadar> well, you can access the data partition from there, so you could just copy the root.tar.gz from USB drive to /data
[18:29] <rigved> Tassadar: 706M
[18:29] <Tassadar> yeah, that is a bit too much
[18:36] <rigved> Tassadar: ok
[18:37] <Tassadar> you wanna try to install it using the recovery?
[18:38] <rigved> i could try. has anyone tried it before?
[18:38] <rigved> did it work?
[18:39] <Tassadar> i would guess not, but well, it is just copying one file
[18:39] <Tassadar> you don't even have to install the recovery, just boot it using "fastboot boot"
[18:40] <jpastore> is it a problem to install php5 on a beaglebone?
[18:42] <rigved> Tassadar: ok. please correct me if i got this wrong. install the 8G version manually; before booting into ubuntu the first time, boot into fastboot boot; copy the new root.tar.gz over to the /data partition; then boot into ubuntu.
[18:44] <Tassadar> well, you need to make the /data 27gb big, and you can't really do that without loosing data, so I would recomend flashing factory android image (that will also properly format /data to 27gb
[18:44] <Tassadar> )
[18:45] <Tassadar> then wiping /data, and copying rootfs.tar.gz in there
[18:46] <Tassadar> (if your /data is not properly formated already, that is, I dunno what that failed fastboot did, maybe it did not do anything)
[18:51] <rigved> Tassadar: ok. i am trying that now.
[18:51] <jpastore> so I'm trying to setup a webserver on a beaglebone. started by apt-get install php5, figured that would give me everything i needed or get me close. apt-get failed and recommended: apt-get -f install...which also failed. pastebin: http://pastebin.com/VxajDrkQ
[18:52] <jpastore> any ideas on how to resolve?
[18:52] <Tassadar> did you do apt-get update?
[18:53] <jpastore> i did
[18:53] <Tassadar> it says "E: Cannot get debconf version. Is debconf installed?", did you notice that?
[18:54] <jpastore> checking
[18:55] <jpastore> aptitude search debconf shows pi next to it. i means installed correct? i'm used to the gui on my laptop
[18:56] <Tassadar> I don't really know, but trying "apt-get install debconf" would surely do no harm
[18:59] <jpastore> Tassadar, installing debconf is failing via apt-get and aptitude...here's the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/6PQYpYTu
[19:01] <Tassadar> it kinda looks like there is something broken in there, it looks kinda weird that "apt-utils", "dpkg" and "coreutils" are not installed yet
[19:01] <jpastore> i think older versions are installed
[19:01] <jpastore> and it's not updating
[19:02] <jpastore> maybe I should backup the image and do a distribtion upgrade?
[19:02] <Tassadar> wait, your dpkg status file was broken, wasn't it?
[19:02] <jpastore> I think so
[19:02] <Tassadar> how did you fix it?
[19:02] <jpastore> I'm trying: aptitude -f install dpkg
[19:03] <jpastore> it's not
=== Sv2 is now known as sv
[19:04] <jpastore> it's failing on libc6 support and multiarch-support
[19:05] <Tassadar> I dunno, it to me it _looks_ like something is terribly messed up, if that status file is not correct, it _might_ be the cause
[19:06] <jpastore> Tassadar, I moved the status and touched a new one because i was getting errors saying the status file could not be parsed
[19:06] <jpastore> I was then able to do an apt-get update
[19:06] <jpastore> I then later tried to install php5...and now I'm stuck
[19:07] <Tassadar> can you check what is in that status file? Like did it re-fill that file or is it just empty?
[19:09] <jpastore> it repopulated
[19:09] <jpastore> it's about 3600 bytes...whereas the backup one was over 400k
[19:11] <Tassadar> maybe it can't be just repopulated like that
[19:13] <jpastore> maybe...but I was going on a suggestion from ogra_. it seemed to allow the apt-get update to work but I'm not able to install basic stuf like tzdata
[19:13] <jpastore> I wish there was a repair all problems option....
[19:13] <Tassadar> try to ls /var/backup, there might be another backup of dpkg.status
[19:14] <jpastore> ok... 1 sec
[19:15] <jpastore> there's a dkph.status.0 that's 435k like the other status file I backed up
[19:16] <jpastore> Tassadar, I got these: /var/backups/dpkg.status.0  /var/backups/dpkg.status.1.gz  /var/backups/dpkg.status.2.gz
[19:16] <Tassadar> well, try to use it, maybe that one is okay
[19:16] <jpastore> ok
[19:17] <jpastore> just copy that file to /var/lib/dpkg/status and run apt-get update?
[19:17] <jpastore> no it's unable to be parsed
[19:17] <Tassadar> yeah
[19:18] <jpastore> trying to regen the file
[19:18] <jpastore> this is like tryign to fix a looping cpan failure...
[19:29] <Tassadar> yeah, dpkg/status is rather fragile :/ why did it break anyway?
[19:31] <Tassadar> like, isn't the sdcard corrupted or something?
[19:31] <jpastore> Tassadar, it's been broken. I got an image installer for the beagle bone ...no love. I was told not enough ram to handle updates but i find that hard to believe. after going through the steps to resolve I seem better off but not funcitoning and don't know what to do
[19:31] <jpastore> not sure the sd card is corrupt...possible but unlikely. it's a spare 32g I had in a phone
[19:33] <Tassadar> I don't really know anything about the beagleboard, somebody who does would probably be more helpful
[19:33] <jpastore> appreciated.
[19:34] <jpastore> thanks for the effort. when I go over to #beagle* they give me crap for installing ubuntu instead of solving the problem. so I'm at a loss for where to go..
[19:34] <Tassadar> :D
[19:39] <jpastore> Tassadar, what about downloading these packages and manually installing them. like debconf and perl-base
[19:42] <Tassadar> well, there is no harm in trying, but I am inclined to think that dpkg status file can't be even fixed
[19:44] <jpastore> hmmm...
[19:44] <jpastore> maybe I should backup this image and try a fresh 12.10 image. I had problems with that too...but maybe the status fix that I did in 12.04 will make it work.
[19:45] <Tassadar> yeah, flashing fresh image would probably be the best
[19:49] <jpastore> yea I think I'm going to try that later...
[19:49] <jpastore> thanks again
[19:51] <camm`> anyone here able to field a reloc question?
[20:33] <Tassadar> Jef91: you maintain BohdiLinux image for nexus 7, right?
[20:34] <Jef91> Yes Sir Tassadar
[20:36] <Ethernin> Hey Jef91 do u have a package list for the enlightenment stuff you installed?  I'd love to have this setup on top of ubuntu as the desktop environment and am wondering what else i need besides e17
[20:36] <Tassadar> you realeased new one yesterday, will apt-get upgrade update my current installation? Or are these just images without proper repositories?
[20:37] <Jef91> Tassadar: most of my stuff is just manually setup at the moment
[20:37] <Jef91> Not in package form
[20:37] <Jef91> So, tl/dr you need to reflash
[20:37] <Tassadar> okay, thanks
[20:37] <Jef91> Ethernin: I have my own custom package set
[20:38] <Jef91> Ubuntu E17 packages are old and awkward
[20:38] <Ethernin> Jef91, word, is the list on your website at all?
[20:38] <Jef91> Ethernin: packages.bodhilinux.com has our repo list in html form
[20:39] <Jef91> Lots of stuff on there.
[20:41] <Tassadar> btw, I was kinda surprised to see how fast e17 is on n7, both unity and plasma are struggling with 3D acceleration I guess :)
[20:41] <Jef91> ha
[20:41] <Jef91> Tassadar: e17 is fast on everything
[20:41] <Jef91> modern desktops need to learn from it
[20:42] <Jef91> and stop bloating their shit
[20:42] <Ethernin> aweomse thanks Jef91
[20:43] <Jef91> Ethernin: keep in mind the ARMHF packages there are built for Debian Wheezy
[20:43] <Jef91> YMMV on other platforms
