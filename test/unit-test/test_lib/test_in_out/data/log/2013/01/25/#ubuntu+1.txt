[01:05] <BarkingFish> Good morning guys :)  Anyone else having trouble getting ndiswrapper to build on the new 3.8 kernel?  I've just upgraded to raring to do some bugsmashing, and had to drop back to the 3.5.0.22 kernel to get ndiswrapper back :(
[02:47] <yoasif> what is the best way to report audio bugs?
[02:50] <bjsnider> yoasif, well, that depends
[02:50] <bjsnider> what is the nature of the problem?
[02:50] <yoasif> bjsnider: audio output stopped working after updates
[02:50] <yoasif> havent tried using an old kernel yet
[02:51] <bjsnider> ok, so probably doing ubuntu-bug alsa from the cli
[02:51] <bjsnider> your audio drivers are in the kernel
[02:51] <bjsnider> it may not end up being correct but it's a good place to start and will ping the right people
[02:51] <yoasif> bjsnider: thanks... ill try a reboot and try again
[02:52] <yoasif> tried some of the old audio wiki recommendations
[02:54] <turgay> I can not get sound
[02:55] <turgay> http://ompldr.org/vaDdjZQ   I can not get sound
[02:55] <yoasif> bjsnider: uh, apparently alsa doesnt exist - is it alsa-base?
[02:55] <bjsnider> sure

[09:43] <rye> hi, is installation image planned to be on 3.7 for the final release? I'm asking this because on sandybridge chipsets that makes GPU and CPU run at full speed, 3.8 has this fixed
[09:43]  * rye talks about kernel
[10:05] <yofel> rye: current kernel is a 3.8 RC, so it'll probably stay on 3.8
[10:06] <rye> yofel: the cds are @ 3.7, do you mean it will stay on 3.7 ?
[10:06] <yofel> the daily builds?
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
[10:07] <yofel> I don't see a 3.7 kernel in the archive anymore so that shouldn't be possible
[10:08] <rye> yofel: interesting...
[10:09] <yofel> and the meta package is on 3.8 as well
[10:09] <yofel> !info linux-image-generic
[10:09] <ubottu> linux-image-generic (source: linux-meta): Generic Linux kernel image. In component main, is optional. Version 3.8.0.1.14 (raring), package size 2 kB, installed size 32 kB
[10:15] <rye> yofel: ok, sorry, PEBKAC. Wrong image (was writing in 12.04 because disk sync/flush mount options in 13.04 make writing disk images unbearably slow and it had an older image selected by default)
[10:17] <rye> which is another bug but it looks like people want sync writing to flash drives even if that makes the overall process slower
[10:58] <om26er> oh boy, raring has poor wifi connectivity
[11:12] <rye> om26er: what hardware?
[11:13] <om26er> rye, atheros AR9485
[11:13] <om26er> on Asus UX31E
[11:13] <rye> om26er: 802.11g or n ?
[11:13] <om26er> n
[11:14] <rye> om26er: has anybody actually got ath9k working properly with 802.11n? So far all I hear (and see) is with n _everything_ starts to break
[11:15] <rye> everything but android phones :(
[11:15] <om26er> rye, well it was working perfectly fine in 12.04 and 12.10 for me
[11:16] <rye> om26er: interesting... Are you sure your card supported n at these distros (I assisted an upgrade for UL30 recently from 10.04 to 12.04 where in 12.04 card started supporting n but it did not work properly)
[11:16] <rye> also ath9k
[12:14]  * rye is happy- http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~usb-creator-hackers/usb-creator/trunk/revision/405
[12:14] <rye> Reverting sync option!

[18:07] <BluesKaj> hi hggdh
[18:07] <hggdh> (a bit late, I guess, but still...)
[18:07] <BluesKaj> yeah , not much action here today
[19:16] <jtaylor> anyone got a pristine steam install?
[19:16] <jtaylor> need to check a possible security issue
[19:29] <jtaylor> nevermind checked it on another machine

[22:25] <NMinker> I need a clarification, where are package proposals for Raring supposed to be submitted? Release or Proposed. I remember at the last UDS, it was recommended all new proposals/packages should be submitted to Proposed
[22:26] <padster> how do you get raring daily build isos to install? the installer always hangs before partitioning for me
[22:28] <NMinker> @padster what kind of machine are you using? (physical, VM, etc)
[22:28] <padster> physical
[22:28] <padster> on the live usb right now
[22:29] <NMinker> maybe the installer (or the daily build) is just buggy
[22:30] <padster> it seems to be a known bug, i googled it, but i was hoping someone had further knowledge of a fix
[22:30] <padster> is there an alternate method of installation?
[22:32] <NMinker> upgrade Quantal -> Raring (as in clean installation of Quantal, and just upgrade to Raring)
[22:32] <padster> yeah, i suppose i could try that
[22:33] <padster> i'll try that, thanks
