[03:18] <LaRueGT> is there like, a really really simple sound recorder in the repo's somewhere? just a really tiny one that only does record to a wav file, really basic
[03:18] <holstein> LaRueGT: theres "sound recorder"
[03:18] <holstein> most use audacity.. you would record and export the .wav
[03:19] <LaRueGT> nah audacity is too much, I need simpler, tiny, like the windows one in the accesories menu
[03:19] <holstein> LaRueGT: i would just load up windows
[03:19] <holstein> i guarantee you you wont find that one in the repos
[03:20] <holstein> otherwise, i'll keep firing out suggestions
[03:20] <cfhowlett> LaRueGT, soundrecorder
[03:20] <LaRueGT> well, that isn't the point really, I just wanna dig into the code of a really basic program that takes microphone input
[03:20] <LaRueGT> theres to much going on in audacity to make sense of it
[03:21] <holstein> LaRueGT: soundrecorder.. pretend i didnt say anything about audacity
[03:23] <holstein> http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/03/audio-recorder-for-linux-easily-record-audio-streams-to-mp3
[03:23] <holstein> https://launchpad.net/audio-recorder
[03:25] <holstein> its part of gnome-media , if you dont want that...
[03:27] <cfhowlett> Hey, while we're all here... WHY?  Created a video with openshot; 33mb file.  Used ffmpeg to embed some metadata.  NO other changes ... 13mb file.  What gives?
[03:28] <holstein> cfhowlett: i saw that
[03:28] <holstein> cfhowlett: who knows
[03:28] <holstein> obviously, thats not the only change
[03:28] <cfhowlett> it's the only change I selected ... no format change.  I'm concerned about what I've "lost".
[04:20] <holstein> cfhowlett: i would not be concerned about what was lost
[04:20] <holstein> i would go to the original..
[08:28] <zequence> LaRueGT: Not sure, but the jack tool jack_rec might be even easier to get into, codewise.
[08:29] <zequence> LaRueGT: There's also arecord, a part of alsa tools
[08:44] <fullmoon> good morning, afternoon, evening i kinda got a problem which i didn't had in ubuntu studio 10.04. Now I'm using 12.04 64bit. Problem is i can't move any folders?? why cant i move folders from my desktop to other folders??>>>error: File or folder does not exsist<<<
[13:04] <multimedia> Hello
[13:16] <tontis> Hello, I've got a cuestion! I've been trying to make jackd and qjackctl work through various suggestions that I've found online, including this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudioPreparation. Still, it seems to just get worse, now qjackctl just freezes when I start it.
[13:17] <tontis> So I was thinking of re-installing ubuntu altogether and directly do the mentioned tutorial step by step, but since it says this "Please note that only "proved to work" Ubuntu releases will be documented in time on this tutorial. The current one is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS." I'm not sure if I should do it on 12.10 or 12.04. Also, do you think this is a good idea at all?
[13:29] <zequence> tontis: All you need to do is answer "yes" to realtime, when installing jackd, and adding yourself to audio group
[13:29] <zequence> ..in order to get realtime privilege
[13:30] <zequence> If you need lower latency (the standard kernel is not very fast for audio), you can install linux-lowlatency
[13:30] <zequence> That's all you need to get jackd running in realtime with low latency
[13:32] <zequence> tontis: To make sure the jackd installation went fine, make sure the file /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf is not named /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf.disabled
[13:32] <zequence> hmm..
[13:50] <mighty_aboba> Hi
[13:53] <mighty_aboba> Does somebody have E-mu 0204 USB soundcard?
[15:54] <wip> hi everyone ! i was wondering if any of you use VST(i) under ubuntu-studio 64bit. what are my options?
[17:33] <ParadoxGuitarist> So... I'm working on an arrangement...
[17:33] <ParadoxGuitarist> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Dfq6vylRQ
[17:33] <ParadoxGuitarist> @ 2:17Â there's 4 quick notes... are they 32nd's or 16th note Triplets?
[17:34] <ParadoxGuitarist> I kind of feel like when it's that fast there's no real point, but...
[18:23] <holstein> ParadoxGuitarist: if its an arrangement, then just do an arrangment
[18:23] <holstein> sounds like just a fill to me
[18:23] <holstein> i wouldnt try and emulate what is there.. then its not an arragment
[18:24] <ParadoxGuitarist> Well I would just buy sheet music, but it doesn't exist.
[18:24] <ParadoxGuitarist> I want it to be as close to a cover as possible
[18:24] <holstein> ParadoxGuitarist: sure.. thats not an arrangement either
[18:24] <ParadoxGuitarist> We're moving some of the structure to fit a Rock Opera
[18:25] <holstein> i would just do the tune
[18:26] <holstein> the details are more in the playing.. if its a fill, just do a fill
[18:26] <holstein> otherwise, just play the track from the CD
[18:26] <holstein> it'll cost the same, probably either way
[18:27] <ParadoxGuitarist> I was going to break up the song to do a reprise.
[18:27] <ParadoxGuitarist> Are you familiar with Beethoven's Last Night by TSO?
[18:27] <holstein> nope
[18:27] <ParadoxGuitarist> It's good if you like Symphonic Metal stuff
[18:27] <holstein> i dont. but im pulling it up on youtube
[18:28] <ParadoxGuitarist> =)
[18:29] <ParadoxGuitarist> Anyways, Mephistopheles appears but there's nothing to really pull on his appearance in the music they wrote
[18:29] <holstein> yeah, thats awful
[18:29] <ParadoxGuitarist> Which you think when the Devil appears it would be a little more dramatic
[18:29] <holstein> i mean, thats just my opinion.. but its pretty bad
[18:29] <holstein> and, you dont have to pay for that
[18:29] <holstein> so, you get the recognition of the track withouth having to pay for it
[18:29] <holstein> the sounds are crap too
[18:29] <holstein> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q69JNbvOJWU
[18:30] <holstein> bad synth sounds with loud drums and guitars... again.. just my opinion
[18:30] <holstein> ParadoxGuitarist: i would just compose my own theme for the devil, but im a composer
[18:31] <ParadoxGuitarist> Yeah and I don't have time for that.
[18:32] <ParadoxGuitarist> It's not really getting recognition for it
[18:32] <ParadoxGuitarist> More like getting reliable sheet music to my instrumentalists.
[18:32] <holstein> i wouldnt have time for what you are doing.. but hey.. to each his own
[18:33] <ParadoxGuitarist> The Tabs that are out there are just wrong, and I don't think they'll have time to figure it out on their own
[18:33] <ParadoxGuitarist> It's pretty much done, it only took 2 days
[18:33] <ParadoxGuitarist> in my spare time
[18:33] <ParadoxGuitarist> Except for that one little fill
[18:34] <ParadoxGuitarist> but no matter
[18:34] <ParadoxGuitarist> As always holstein, you give great advice.
[18:35] <holstein> well, i do what i can :)
