[01:22] <akerok> Hello everyone.  I have a bit of an issure with my ubuntu server.
[01:22] <RoyK> !ask
[01:22] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[01:24] <akerok> I'm running ubuntu server 12.04, and I was trying to configure the IP address to my new static IP so it can be accesses online (it's a web server).  I have to run it in a VM (I'm using Virtual Box for this).  I can no longer access the server using ssh, and I can't get it to allow me to access it directly.  It doesn't even give me the option to log in directly.
[02:23] <pdtpatrick> Why does pvcreate give an error when ran in a script that device is ignored or filtered but running the same command manually works just fine? http://pastie.org/private/unch4uvjjkmmtpimsxwv8q

[13:02] <sw0rdfish> jeez
[13:02] <sw0rdfish> what were the websites for european VPS' for 5 or 6 euros again?
[13:13]  * slyboots faceplants
[13:14] <slyboots> Anyone know how you delete a freaking mdadm RAID array?  It keeps rebuilding despite me deleting it..
[13:14] <slyboots> And running mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdX doesnt work "mdadm: Unreconginised md component device - /dev/sdX"
[13:20] <RoyK> slyboots: mdadm --stop ?
[13:20] <RoyK> slyboots: then just dd a bunch of zeros on the devices
[13:21] <slyboots> Aye, Thats what Im doing now.. its crazy thats what its come to
[13:22] <RoyK> a few megabytes will do
[13:22] <RoyK> on each device
[13:22] <slyboots> Aye, rebooted and its no-longer seeing the RAID array anymore, weird thats what the solution is though
[13:22] <slyboots> Still trying to figure out the best way to build a NAS, 4x disks.. quite keen to try ZFS but.. eh
[13:23]  * RoyK finds that a rather terrific solution ;)
[13:23] <RoyK> ZFS is cool, but not as flexible as md
[13:23] <RoyK> and under fuse, write speeds suck rather hard
[13:23] <slyboots> I thought it was native, not fuse
[13:24] <slyboots> (Although write-speeds are awful)
[13:24] <RoyK> no native zfs in linux yet, that is, zfsonlinux exists, but probably not stable yet
[13:24] <RoyK> and will probably *never* enter any distro because of licensing
[13:24] <slyboots> Aye, mdadm seems a bit.. I dunno, build it once and it had to resync twice.. :P
[13:25] <RoyK> MD is like, build a mirror, convert to raid-5, add a few drives and convert to raid-6, get low on space, convert to raid-5 again...
[13:26] <RoyK> zfs is like, build a raidz1 VDEV and it'll stay in that form until you remove it
[13:26] <slyboots> Well, thats not a huge problem. I've got a lil hp microserver so it only takes 4x disks anyway
[13:26] <RoyK> but then, zfs has checksumming and support for l2arc and slog, ssd caching
[13:26] <slyboots> But yea, the performance is *awful*
[13:27] <RoyK> slyboots: then use omnios or openindiana or some other illumos distro - there it's native, and pretty neat
[13:27] <slyboots> Yea I tired openindina, spend about a hour sobbing in a corner lol..
[13:27] <RoyK> performance with MD is quite good ;)
[13:27] <slyboots> Yea with mdadm Im getting about 60=80MB/sec over GigE which is about.. wella s much as you can hope for
[13:27]  * RoyK had 350TiB or so on openindiana at his last job
[13:27] <slyboots> ZFS was about.. 20MB/sec?
[13:28] <RoyK> that's because of fuse
[13:28] <slyboots> WEll, might try a native zfs, see if it really makes a difference
[13:28] <RoyK> native zfs is quite fast
[13:28] <RoyK> it won't be as fast as MD, though, because of the checksumming
[13:29] <slyboots> well I figure it shouldnt be slower by a factor of 4..
[13:29] <RoyK> of course, you can turn that off for a dataset, but that somewhat takes away the fun of zfs
[13:29] <RoyK> slyboots: you can't compare native zfs with zfs under fuse...
[13:29] <slyboots> Yea, Checksumming is good.. dedup not so much
[13:29] <RoyK> don't use it
[13:29] <RoyK> I mean DO NOT USE DEDUP ON ZFS
[13:29] <RoyK> I've spent hours testing that
[13:30] <slyboots> Oh neat, OmniOS has a esxi application, ssweet
[13:30] <RoyK> there's a very good reason why dedup never entered Solaris 11
[13:31] <slyboots> Its just awful? :P
[13:31] <RoyK> well, it doesn't work too well, unless you have a terabyte of RAM or so
[13:34] <RoyK> slyboots: but with something illumos, you get snapshotting and perhaps SSD caching (if you have room for that in that microserver)
[13:35] <slyboots> Nah, its pretty tight fit unless I did something over USB/eSATA
[13:35] <RoyK> slyboots: but then, you get snapshotting if you're brave enough to use btrfs, and ssd caching if you're brave enough to use bcache ;)
[13:36] <slyboots> lol, lot of intresting things you can do but.. eh, its only a lil server so.. playing it safe
[13:37] <RoyK> ext4 on MD is safe
[13:37] <RoyK> omnios or openindiana should be safe too
[13:37] <slyboots> Aye, shall be intresting to test em
[13:38] <RoyK> if you have windows clients, snapshots show up under "previous versions" in windows if you have an illumos server (given you use the CIFS server, and not Samba)
[13:38] <slyboots> Ah cool, shadow-copy support?
[13:38] <RoyK> yep
[13:38] <slyboots> Neat :)
[13:44] <RoyK> setup a server on that for a remote office in my last job - never heard a word of anything related to data restores later ;)
[13:44] <RoyK> the autosnapshot service in Illumos is rather good for such things
[13:45] <RoyK> unless you do something stupid as starting to use some file area with snapshotting as a spooling space or temp space
[13:45] <slyboots> heh, we still have to take care of that manually at work :P
[13:47] <RoyK> slyboots: as I said, zfs doesn't support extending VDEVs or changing RAID levels. It supports replacing drives with bigger ones, though (given zpool set autoexpand=on)
[13:47] <slyboots> Kinda shitty like that, odd you cant expland
[13:47] <slyboots> *expand
[13:48] <RoyK> it'll require the famous block pointer rewrite mechanism that was reported to be worked on some three years ago
[13:48] <slyboots> :P

[15:15] <slyboots> RoyK: Dont suppose you know any good gides for this OmniOS :P
[15:18] <RoyK> slyboots: just follow the guides for openindiana or even opensolaris
[15:18] <RoyK> same thing, different wrapping
[15:19] <RoyK> slyboots: but if you want to install on a microserver, I guess that only has four drives, are all four of them meant to be used for data?
[15:19] <RoyK> if so, use a pen drive for the root
[15:19] <RoyK> or two
[15:19] <slyboots> AYe, already got that all setup
[15:20] <RoyK> zpool create mydatapool dev1 dev2 dev3 dev4
[15:20] <RoyK> probably something like c0t0d0
[15:20] <RoyK> don't partition them

[17:22] <slyboots> -So..... Filesystems!
[17:22] <slyboots> Its on a home NAS, mostly large files like media.. perforamnce is imporataint so Im thinking either ext4 which appears to be the Go-to FS.. but I've heard xfs is quite good too
[17:28] <RoyK> slyboots: no big difference
[17:29] <RoyK> ext4 is a good allrounder, xfs is perhaps better on large files, but sucks sick through a straw when it comes to metadata operations, like lots of files in a directory
[17:30] <slyboots> Mmm..
[17:30] <slyboots> AYe, I've decided to sod ZFS, at least for now
[17:30] <slyboots> Wills tick with ZFS..
[17:31] <slyboots> Found some awsome tweaks for mdadm thats got the rebuild down from 10+ hours to about 3
[17:31] <RoyK> zfs is good for dedicated storage systems IMHO
[17:31] <slyboots> Aye, I've used FreeNAS and its worked well in the past, no idea why its so god awful inside a VM
[17:32] <RoyK> erm
[17:32] <RoyK> don't use a VM for hosting storage
[17:32] <RoyK> just don't
[17:32] <RoyK> it's stupid
[17:32] <slyboots> Eh, I dont have the hardware to avoid it
[17:34] <slyboots> Maybe in a few months when Im not crazy poor will buy something dedicated
[17:34] <RoyK> then setup the system with native drives and use it for virtualization
[17:34] <RoyK> not the other way around
[17:35] <qman__> actually, that's not true anymore of xfs
[17:35] <qman__> but I don't trust it because it's lost my data more than once
[17:35] <qman__> I'm going to zfs myself
[17:35] <RoyK> qman__: really? they fixed it?
[17:35] <qman__> yes, as of ~3.0
[17:35] <qman__> kernel 3.0 that is
[17:35] <RoyK> ok
[17:35] <slyboots> I dunno, its hard enough getting zfs going inside OpenIndiana, I would dread setting up virtulisation isnide that too
[17:36] <slyboots> Plus, I've no screen for my microserver lol
[17:36] <RoyK> slyboots: it's no problem getting zfs going good in openindiana ;)
[17:37] <RoyK> qman__: I chose !zfs because of the flexibility of MD
[17:37] <slyboots> RoyK: yea but its using it for aother things too, its too.. "Strange"
[17:37] <slyboots> :P
[17:38] <RoyK> slyboots: well, I can't blame you for not knowing what you do, but I can try ;)
[17:38] <jchamb2010> Hi, does anyone here have knowledge of dual NIC setups and wouldn't mind helping me troubleshoot an issue I'm having? More info: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2100344
[17:38] <slyboots> But yea, mdadm works "Fine" inside a VM enviroment
[17:38] <slyboots> Get about 60-80MB writes, thats about as best as I Could hope
[17:38] <RoyK> slyboots: Just don't run storage servers virtualized
[17:38] <RoyK> slyboots: really
[17:39] <qman__> jchamb2010, you have two gateways, don't do that
[17:39] <RoyK> slyboots: as in *really*
[17:39] <jchamb2010> qman__ : is that really all it is?
[17:39] <qman__> if you need both gateways you need to either set up metrics, or configure load balancing
[17:39] <qman__> otherwise get rid of one
[17:39] <jchamb2010> qman__ : IDK why I didn't try that
[17:41] <qman__> yep, that's all it is
[17:41] <qman__> as-is, they're treated as identical
[17:41] <jchamb2010> I'll try that and see what happens
[17:41] <qman__> and the kernel stupidly assumes that they are identical in every way, and just chooses at random where to send traffic out
[17:41] <qman__> regardless of its nature
[17:41] <qman__> and expects it to come back from either
[17:42] <jchamb2010> I can disable the eth0 though, and eth1 still won't work
[17:43] <qman__> it might not be configured right, or plugged into the right spot
[17:43] <qman__> is 74.91.21.41 pingable through eth0?
[17:43] <jchamb2010> yes
[17:43] <jchamb2010> what you said works though :) i removed a gateway and it started working
[17:45] <qman__> 74.91.31.45 is pingable from here, so it looks like you're all set
[17:45] <jchamb2010> Thank you very much :)
[17:54] <jchamb2010> I replied to the thread with the fix and thanking you. Have a good afternoon :D

[19:02] <SnowBro-> first of all i want to say sorry for my english, it's not my native...now the issue, im NEW to Linux and i pick Ubuntu Server as my option because the great support community that it has, im trying to put to work a machine as a server, i already installes LAMP environment (from tasksel), and i have everything working inside my network (i can access to the server in every machine inside my house), but i dont know how to go out with
[19:02] <SnowBro->  the server, thats my issue, any clues?
[19:15] <rckrd> hey guys, so i've have a small personal server and i want to use it for a few different things (development, music server, etc).  Whats the best way to keep these functions separate?  Virtual machines?  Or just different users and groups?
[19:21] <greppy> rckrd: unless you have LOTS of resources ( RAM & CPU ) just use different users/groups.
