[00:54] <Sprocks> anyone able to help with an apparent grub issue? when I reboot/boot my ubuntu server the grub menu just sits there until I go to it and hit enter
[01:08] <patdk-lap> Sprocks, one of two issues
[01:08] <patdk-lap> either grub yelled that something wasn't supported
[01:08] <patdk-lap> or grub didn't boot right last time, so it's waiting for manual confirmation
[01:09] <Sprocks> how will I know if something isn't supported?
[01:10] <patdk-lap> stuff like
[01:10] <patdk-lap> Warning: /dev/mapper/root is a crypto device, which GRUB cannot read directly.  Some necessary modules may be missing from /boot/grub/grub.cfg.  You may need to list them in GRUB_PRELOAD_MODULES in /etc/default/grub.  See http://bugs.debian.org/542165 for details.
[01:10] <ninjix> does anyone have a example of a libvirt xml for direct kernel booting 12.04?
[01:11] <Sprocks> would that show on the screen?
[01:12] <ninjix> here's an example of the libivrt config I'm trying to use http://paste.ubuntu.com/1511459/
[01:13] <ninjix> it just comes up with a black screen
[01:14] <ninjix> don't see anything when I 'virsh console test1'
[01:22] <Sprocks> patdk-lap how/where would I see this warning?
[01:25] <Spanky> Any of the network geniuses here have an idea about the STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) setting in DD-WRT?
[01:26] <Spanky> To enable or disable?
[01:26] <sarnold> Spanky: funny enough I just read about STP in the brctl manpage...
[01:27] <Spanky> My old Cisco / Linksys WRVS 4400N at the home office crapped the bed entirely this morning and gave up the ghost.
[01:27] <sarnold> Spanky: the gist is, it is a standardized way for you to have loops in your ethernet and the switches can figure out the correct paths between themselves without going nuts
[01:27] <sarnold> (in the past, loops were a definite no-no)
[01:28] <lifeless> still are :P
[01:28] <sarnold> so, if you've got loops, _and_ all your switches do STP, you'll definitely want it.
[01:28] <sarnold> if you've got loops and at least one switch doesn't do STP, you'll be in a world of hurt
[01:28] <lifeless> Spanky: turn STP on unless you have no other switches (including any virtualised inside linux servers) on the same l2 network.
[01:28] <Spanky> Is a looped switch like an ethernet cable going from Switch A to B and then another cable going from Switch B to A?
[01:29] <lifeless> Spanky: yes
[01:29] <sarnold> if you don't have loops, it won't matter much.
[01:29] <Spanky> Kind of like a snake eating its own tail?
[01:30] <Spanky> Who the heck would do that - "looping" that is?  I have some switches that "cascade" from other switches but that's about it...
[01:31] <Spanky> So it's not a real risky setting that will bring my network to its knees or anything?
[01:32] <sarnold> right
[01:32] <sarnold> I'd turn it on
[01:33] <Spanky> Thanks for the advice guys.
[01:34] <sarnold> oh, wow, STP apparently can take 30-50 seconds to respond to topology changes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree_protocol
[01:34] <sarnold> I had assumed it'd be quicker :)
[01:34] <lifeless> nah
[01:34] <lifeless> the timers are there for propogation and retransmits
[01:35] <lifeless> its -super- noticable when it kicks in
[01:35] <Spanky> But a topology change would be like a new switch or new wireless access point or something like that right?
[01:35] <lifeless> right
[01:35] <lifeless> plug a new switch into a production network with STP on all its ports and everything stops for 30 seconds while it learns.
[01:36] <Spanky> Would a wireless device like a laptop, android device, or a wired device like a new thin web server or something cause a 30-50 second delay, too?
[01:37] <lifeless> no to all three
[01:37] <lifeless> unless they start emitting STP frames
[01:37] <lifeless> easy way to cause havoc if you are a troublemaker :)
[01:38] <sarnold> hehe

[14:38] <eagles0513875_> hey guys how often by default does ubuntu run ntpd to sync time or does one need to set a cron job for that?
[14:40] <Daviey> eagles0513875_: by default, it happens as a hard blow on interface up.
[14:40] <Daviey> eagles0513875_: you probably want to install ntp for gradual sync
[14:41] <eagles0513875_> Daviey: i was going to setup a cronjob for ntpd as for some reason when time gets out of sync on the server postfix and dovecot throw hissy fits in sending emails it seems
[14:41] <ikonia> that's not how you use ntpd
[14:41] <ikonia> cron depends on time......ntpd manages time....do you see the problem ?
[14:42] <eagles0513875_> actually yes i do
[14:42] <ikonia> and of course mail may go mad if time is out of sync.....time stamps /future/past can cause problems for the target mail serers
[14:42] <Daviey> eagles0513875_: just sudo apt-get install ntp .. then go home :)
[14:42] <eagles0513875_> ikonia: i have noticed that and running sudo ntpd seems to have solved the problem. does ntp function with a configuration file that has it run every so often?
[14:43] <eagles0513875_> Daviey: its already installed just not sure how often it is run and this server doesnt get rebooted too often
[14:43] <ikonia> eagles0513875_: I suggest researching ntp - the ntp daemon should be running 24x7 and sync within a certain drift range
[14:43] <patdk-wk> in my case, removing ntpdate from ifup helps a crapload too
[14:43] <Daviey> eagles0513875_: Are you /certain/ it is installed?  by default, we only install ntpdate
[14:43] <patdk-wk> nothing like 30+ copies of ntpdate running at boot :(
[14:43] <ikonia> if a drift is greater than 5 minuts, ntpd will not sync time
[14:43] <maxb> NTP is designed to run continuously, *not* just occasionally re-step the clock
[14:43] <ikonia> so you need to manually sync the clock to less than 5 minute drift and then maintain ntp
[14:43] <eagles0513875_> Daviey: yes according to apt-cache policy its showing installed
[14:44] <eagles0513875_> ok
[14:45] <eagles0513875_> will do some reading on ntp
[14:45] <ikonia> maybe doing research before trying to run these things is a better step
[14:46] <jamespage> zul, Daviey: any reason why I should not bump python-mock up to 1.0.1?  who would know best?

[14:50] <hallyn> well that was weird.  ssh agent seemed (on raring) in a funky state.  only had one key in it, but had to ssh-add -D and reload it

My Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS keeps dropping connection sporadically, it has 2 networks cards in it so I configured the second one and changed to that one and it is still happening, I am using aa static internal address. What could it be or how could I pinpoint this issue?
[15:01] <tdelam> The servers purpose is simply a web proxy for a web server so it's not overloaded or anything remotely close to that, infact only 3% of it's available resources are used up :)

[17:05] <TheLordOfTime> how can i create a local apt mirror, and what spec(s) am i going to need for it?
[17:05] <jpds> TheLordOfTime: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors
[17:05] <tgm4883> TheLordOfTime, depends on what you want to use it for
[17:06] <tgm4883> eg. public vs private mirror
[17:06] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, private mirror
[17:06] <tgm4883> TheLordOfTime, full mirror or partial?
[17:06] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, difference?
[17:06] <tgm4883> eg. all ubuntu releases, or only some
[17:07] <tgm4883> For our private mirror at work, I only mirror 12.04
[17:07] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, precise and later.
[17:07] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, needs precise, quantal, raring, and likely later
[17:07] <TheLordOfTime> althoug hcome April a full mirror may be more prudent.
[17:07] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, short term i need precise and quantal
[17:08] <tgm4883> well for a full mirror (with I assume less maintenance), you would just use rsync
[17:08] <tgm4883> here, I use apt-mirror
[17:09] <tgm4883> I say the other is less maintenance because you are just doing a full sync, where with apt-mirror, I have to tell it what releases I want
[17:09] <tgm4883> TheLordOfTime, How much space do you have?
[17:10] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, how much'll i need minimum?
[17:10] <tgm4883> 550GB for a full mirror according to the wiki
[17:10] <TheLordOfTime> at least, just for precise
[17:10] <TheLordOfTime> (i'd like to get Quantal, but...)
[17:11] <tgm4883> looks like i'm using 88GB for precise
[17:11] <TheLordOfTime> 88GB is no issue, so assuming twice, 176GB maybe?
[17:11] <tgm4883> and that is also i386 and amd64 only
[17:11] <TheLordOfTime> which is all I need
[17:11] <tgm4883> TheLordOfTime, I'd say 200GB should be fine
[17:12] <tgm4883> Assuming that Quantal has more packages than Precise
[17:12] <TheLordOfTime> mhm
[17:13] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, how do i configure the apt-mirror (for precise at least)?
[17:13] <tgm4883> TheLordOfTime, so once apt-mirror is installed, configure /etc/apt/mirror.list
[17:14] <tgm4883> ours looks like http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1513561/
[17:14] <tgm4883> set the base path to where you want to store the stuff
[17:14] <TheLordOfTime> root-writable?
[17:14] <TheLordOfTime> or can it run in userspace
[17:14] <tgm4883> it runs as the user apt-mirror
[17:16] <tgm4883> oh, you'll need a webserver too
[17:16] <TheLordOfTime> oops i have to update my local server
[17:16] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, does nginx work?
[17:16] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[17:16] <tgm4883> TheLordOfTime, I'd assume anything that can serve up files would work
[17:17] <tgm4883> I just use apache and symlink the mirror to /var/www/ubuntu
[17:17] <TheLordOfTime> i can configure where nginx listens which makes life easy
[17:18] <TheLordOfTime> should probably update the system first :P
[17:18] <TheLordOfTime> (96 updates)
[17:19] <tgm4883> Not 100% sure that matters, but ok
[17:19] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, a lot of it is security updates :P
[17:19] <TheLordOfTime> which means i should update anyways
[17:19] <tgm4883> yes
[17:20] <tgm4883> Once you've mirrored everything, you'll need to point your clients to this server (you should probably point this server at itself too)
[17:20] <tgm4883> Now, depending on how large environment and what exactly you are trying to accomplish, squid-deb-proxy might work better
[17:20] <TheLordOfTime> indeed.
[17:21] <tgm4883> which just caches packages that are requested
[17:21] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, small environment - 6 systems, plus 2 VMs.
[17:21] <tgm4883> hmm
[17:22] <RoyK> anyone that knows a good VoD solution that can work well in a large environment and has good content management? testing mediamosa now with sitebuilder, and it's got a few bad sides
[17:22] <tgm4883> what is the need for the mirror?
[17:22] <tgm4883> slow internet connection? Don't want to redownload the same packages repeatedly?
[17:22] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, the second one, as well as intermittent external connectivity
[17:23] <TheLordOfTime> at least, from the systems on that subnet
[17:23] <tgm4883> TheLordOfTime, ah ok, so yea a mirror is probably better then
[17:23] <tgm4883> You'll also want to edit /etc/cron.d/apt-mirror for when you want it to sync
[17:24] <TheLordOfTime> which sync time would you suggest?
[17:24] <RoyK> once an hour?
[17:24] <tgm4883> Depends on how up to date you want to be?
[17:24] <tgm4883> I do it every 4 hours
[17:24] <tgm4883> RoyK, once an hour is probably overkill
[17:24] <RoyK> should suffice
[17:24] <TheLordOfTime> uptodate daily may be more prudent - unattended-upgrades runs every 24 hours.
[17:24] <TheLordOfTime> and pulls security updates
[17:24] <samba35> hi RoyK how are you
[17:24] <TheLordOfTime> (I got to the machine before unattended-upgrades ran today)
[17:25] <RoyK> samba35: fine, thanks
[17:25] <samba35> was playing with openvswitch
[17:25] <samba35> understanding process
[17:30] <TheLordOfTime> tgm4883, where should i pull data from for the mirror, any of the regional archives (such as one of the us archive mirrors)
[17:31] <tgm4883> TheLordOfTime, Unless you know of a fast local mirror, probably us.archive.u.c
[17:34] <hallyn> jamespage: hey - are you around?
[17:34] <jamespage> hallyn, yep
[17:35] <adam_g> Daviey: looks like its still pointed at the folsom repos?

[18:14] <TheBronx> hi all
[18:15] <TheBronx> is it normal to have thousands of messages like "r8169: eth0: link up" during a SYN flood attack?
[18:15] <TheBronx> what does "link up" means?
[18:15] <TheBronx> mean*
[18:17] <RoyK> TheBronx: it means the realtek driver detected the network link went up (probably just after it went down)
[18:18] <TheBronx> i have this message repeated a lot of times
[18:18] <TheBronx> even 20 or 30 per SECOND
[18:18] <RoyK> realtek NICs are rather infamous of small buffers, and rather bad hardware design in general
[18:18] <TheBronx> so, that's not normal, even under a flood attack of about 50Mbps
[18:19] <RoyK> haven't seen that
[18:19] <RoyK> but could you try with another NIC?
[18:19] <TheBronx> well, Im from spain, the server is in germany
[18:19] <TheBronx> :P
[18:20] <RoyK> virtual or physical?
[18:20] <TheBronx> physical, it is a dedicated server, from hetzner
[18:21] <hallyn> jamespage: did that dget all right?
[18:29] <TheBronx> I've sent a ticket to them explaining the problem. Lets see what they answer
[18:30] <TheBronx> after every attack I can't access the server until I manually restart it remotely
[18:31] <TheBronx> it seems the NIC doesn't "wake up" after the attack
[18:36] <TheBronx> Answer: we have many servers with that network chip and I am not aware of any
[18:36] <TheBronx> problems. However, most of our customers use CentOS Linux, so there
[18:36] <TheBronx> might be an issue with Ubuntu.

[18:47] <TheBronx> is it possible that the link up error is caused by a wrong configuration in /etc/sysctl.conf??
[18:49] <sarnold> TheBronx: in my experience, spurious link up / link down messages point to failing cables, failing switches, etc.
[18:49] <TheBronx> this is my sysctl http://pastebin.com/HUk0RVip
[18:49] <sarnold> TheBronx: though you've got a unique experience, hehe
[18:50] <TheBronx> I will update my ubuntu 10.04 server
[18:50] <TheBronx> http://www.twm-kd.com/linux/realtek-rtl81688111e-and-ubuntu-linux/
[18:50] <TheBronx> it seems there is a bug in the driver
[18:50] <TheBronx> solved in ubuntu 12
[18:51] <sarnold> TheBronx: oh, wow.
[18:51] <TheBronx> is it a good idea? what do you think?
[18:53] <TheBronx> if it doesn't work I will move to a different server, I just can't do more
[18:54] <jamespage> hallyn: it did - sorry I've managed to crash into parenting duties for the evening; is tomorrow AM my time early enough?
[18:54] <TheBronx> is it a good idea? what do you think? sarnold?
[18:55] <sarnold> TheBronx: it seems like a good idea; even if it doesn't _work_, you'll at least be on newer software, with longer support.
[18:55] <hallyn> jamespage: ok, thx, ttyl
[18:57] <TheBronx> well, thank you guys, sarnold and RoyK, I will update everything and see what happens (and what crashes hehehe)
[18:59] <sarnold> TheBronx: hehe :) have fun, good luck

[19:55] <keithzg> Any chance of newer qemu-kvm packages making it into 12.04? I'm desperate for the ability to use blockpull to merge back external snapshots, as one can do in the version in 12.10.
[19:56] <ikonia> doubtful
[19:58] <paco1> hello masters!
[19:58] <paco1> Anybody knows a good documentation to implement TSIG in my DNS in ubuntu 12.04?
[19:58] <paco1> thanks in advance!
[20:00] <keithzg> ikonia: that's what I thought . . . but that leaves me in a pretty tough place. The version of qemu-kvm in 12.04 can split VMs into external snapshots, but not collapse the chain, so incremental backup snapshots result in an ever-growing backing chain . . .
[20:00]  * keithzg is wary of upgrading important hosting a dozen VMs to a non-LTS release, though, so . . . sigh.
[20:03] <RoyK> keithzg: eh - no systems I know can combine snapshots
[20:03] <sarnold> keithzg: perhaps you could ask for a backport? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports
[20:04] <keithzg> sarnold: not a bad plan, not a bad plan a'tall
[20:05] <keithzg> RoyK: maybe not "combine" per se, but at least collapse the backing chain of external snapshot .qcow2 images. It's what the libvirt and qemu folks suggest, since over time an extremely long external chain will start showing performance issues for obvious reasons
[20:06] <tomVovo> hello everyone..
[20:06] <tomVovo> I need help
[20:06] <tomVovo> anyone help me?
[20:06] <keithzg> RoyK: AFAIK there's a nicer, fairly different method of snapshotting coming down the pipeline in qemu that'll do an end-run around these sorts of issues, but *that's* certainly never going to make it into 12.04, heh.
[20:07] <tomVovo> hello
[20:07] <tomVovo> I run my Ubuntu server apache 12.04 ...I have domain with godaddy.com...iT'S WONT CONNECT
[20:07] <tomVovo> HELP!
[20:08] <RoyK> keithzg: the good way is to snapshot at the lvm level, when that gets good - some patches are posted, but haven't been accepted yet
[20:08] <tomVovo> help!!!..
[20:08] <RoyK> the current lvm snapshot model isn't too scalable to say the least :P
[20:08] <RoyK> !ask | tomVovo
[20:08] <ubottu> tomVovo: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[20:09] <tomVovo> ok
[20:09] <ikonia> how do you expect people if you just join a channel saying "help, anyone help, help"
[20:11] <keithzg> RoyK: Heh. I'll admit, I have an irrational aversion to LVM---and at least in my case, the setup I've inherited is on some iSCSI shares where LVM wouldn't be an option anyways---but I don't doubt you're right
[20:16] <ikonia> tomVovo: ok, so the help isn't that urgent then as you've not said anything since being asked to provide information on the problem you have
[20:43] <TheBronx> hey, one question
[20:43] <TheBronx> if I upgrade ubuntu server from 10.04 to 12
[20:43] <TheBronx> via SSH
[20:43] <TheBronx> and the network driver updates
[20:44] <TheBronx> did the SSH connection crash?
[20:44] <TheBronx> will*
[20:44] <RoyK> you'll have to reboot, and after the reboot, it'll probably work
[20:44] <RoyK> *probably*
[20:44] <RoyK> because some issues may come up, some driver may not work etc
[20:45] <TheBronx> will the upgrade process cancel?
[20:45] <RoyK> no, the upgrade process will continue and probably finish until you reboot
[20:45] <RoyK> after the reboot, there's always a chance of something going wrong
[20:45] <RoyK> not a big chance, but still
[20:45] <TheBronx> ok, that's not a problem, I will backup the data
[20:46] <TheBronx> I just was worried about the upgrade process cancelling
[20:46] <RoyK> if you have a good backup, and can live with some downtime, no problem
[20:46] <RoyK> it'll open up a secondary port for ssh for the upgrade
[20:46] <TheBronx> well, after 5 days of continued DDoS downtime is not going to be a problem
[20:46] <TheBronx> xDDDDDD
[20:46] <RoyK> usually it won't cut that port
[20:46] <RoyK> never seen that happen
[20:46] <TheBronx> ok, thank you again RoyK!
[20:47] <RoyK> never seen 22/tcp cut either
[20:47] <RoyK> that is, never used the secondary port
[20:47] <shauno> I like to use screen and plan on it kicking me off.  it never seems to do it if I'm ready for it
[20:49] <RoyK> shauno: did screen kick you out, or did the ssh session die?
[20:50] <RoyK> shauno: tmux is a newer thing simiar to screen, some say better, but it won't help much if the ssh session times out - then you need just ssh keepalives
[20:51] <shauno> neither; I mean if I'm prepared for it to go wrong, it doesn't break.  if I'm not prepared, it's inevitable
[20:52] <RoyK> hehe
[21:55] <phillw> Hi guys, is my theory correct in using the server iso (13.04) about the nearest we can get to the mini-iso that produces a ubuntu type system upon which a DE can be further installed if we select no additional tools?
[21:59] <justizin> hey guys i have a machine whose grub menu i need to get into via the serial console, i don't think shift-down works, i have done it before but my google fu is failing.  anyone got a notion handy of how i can get in?
[22:02] <sw0rdfish> uhh, how do I start znc in screen mode, and detach and re-attach at will?
[22:04] <sarnold> justizin: wild-guess-land: send a break?
[22:05] <sarnold> sw0rdfish: check the screen manpage, look for ^A d (to detach) and screen -RAD (to reattach) -- no idea about znc specifically
[22:05] <justizin> worth a shot. :)
[22:06] <justizin> maybe i fixed this last time by mounting the damned thing to a netbooted nfsroot.
[22:07] <sw0rdfish> hmmm
[22:14] <keithzg> philw: does the net install image not still exist? I'd imagine that'd be the closest, actually.
[22:15] <keithzg> phillw, I mean
[22:15] <jcastro> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[22:15] <jcastro> it exists
[22:16] <phillw> keithzg: at the moment, there is https://launchpad.net/bugs/1077158
[22:16] <uvirtbot> Launchpad bug 1077158 in testdrive "Testdrive should have a netboot repository" [Undecided,New]
[22:16] <phillw> which seems a lonely bug, but blocking
[22:18] <linuxman> Is running a Ubuntu server with Desktop GUI good?
[22:18] <linuxman> I am used to gui..
[22:19] <TheLordOfTime> linuxman, i run a netbook that runs as a fileserver for my network via a GUI
[22:19] <linuxman> i was expecting people to laugh at me
[22:19] <TheLordOfTime> installed Lubuntu to start with, then installed the server packages.  so sort of the opposite of what you're at, but...
[22:19] <linuxman> hehe
[22:19] <TheLordOfTime> linuxman, BUT
[22:20] <TheLordOfTime> you need to be aware of something: ssh != remote desktop enviromnet.
[22:20] <linuxman> yes
[22:20] <TheLordOfTime> as well, the GUI'll tax your RAM/system, so if you don't have a lot of RAM, you'll need to reconsider installation of the gui
[22:21] <linuxman> 10-18 CPU usage, 255MB RAM used out of 512MB
[22:21] <linuxman> my PC is OK about this, I run it in VM
[22:22] <keithzg> phillw: ah, I see I see, no netboot for Raring.
[22:22] <linuxman> i got OpenSSH, LAMP install, how do i manage them?
[22:22] <keithzg> phillw: you could always just use the 12.10 netbook, manually upgrade to raring, and go from there
[22:22] <linuxman> can i access them via GUI, as well as command line?
[22:23] <keithzg> phillw: err, 12.10 netboot I mean
[22:23] <TheLordOfTime> linuxman, unfortunately for you for those... no real gui configuration tools
[22:23] <TheLordOfTime> except for webmin which i strongly DO NOT advise you use.
[22:24] <linuxman> why not?
[22:24] <TheLordOfTime> because i hate guis for server management
[22:24]  * justizin hangs head in shame over defeatist "just mount with netboot nfsroot" solution
[22:25] <linuxman> ok but how do i navigate with command line? i mean how do i configure OpenSSH, LAMP etc.. I am used into having GUI and command line..
[22:26] <keithzg> justizin: what works, works
[22:26]  * TheLordOfTime has to disappear to fix a misbehaving server at a datacenter down the road
[22:26] <TheLordOfTime> so i can't help much more there linuxman, since this is an urgent-attention fix.
[22:27] <linuxman> ok, good luck
[22:27] <sarnold> linuxman: to a certain extent, some packages are configurable via debconf; dpkg-reconfigure <packagename> will prompt you a few times to set things up.
[22:28] <sarnold> linuxman: but that only gets you so far. at some point, things are just easier to configure with a text editor.

[22:38] <linuxman> how do i SSH from outside world into my own Server at home that is running in VM? I have a router and several other people have been assigned internal ips, so as me.
[22:39] <sarnold> linuxman: does your VM have a publicly routable IP address assigned? or does it have an RFC1918 private IP address?
[22:39] <linuxman> i did ifconfig on it, it has a private IP address
[22:39] <linuxman> the router has only ip , its like a NAT
[22:40] <linuxman> it acts*
[22:41] <phillw> keithzg: you have mis understood my request..
[22:42] <sarnold> linuxman: then you'll probably need to portforward a port on your machine to the VM, see e.g. http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/73
[22:45] <linuxman> ok thanks
[23:38] <paco1> Anybody knows TSIG on DNS?
