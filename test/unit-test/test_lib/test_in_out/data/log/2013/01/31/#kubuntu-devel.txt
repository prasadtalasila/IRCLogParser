[04:22] <shadeslayer> morning
=== jtechidna is now known as JontheEchidna
[05:47] <phoenix_firebrd> good morning everyone
[05:48] <shadeslayer> hi phoenix_firebrd :)
[05:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: hi
[05:48] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: so, I have a small task for you
[05:48] <shadeslayer> W: kdiamond source: syntax-error-in-dep5-copyright line 33: Duplicate field license.
[05:48] <shadeslayer> fix this ^
[05:49] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[05:49] <shadeslayer> that's a lintian warning and is googlable
[05:49] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[05:49] <shadeslayer> more specifically the syntax-error-in-dep5-copyright bit
[05:50] <shadeslayer> once you're done, here's another one : E: kfloppy source: malformed-override Override of dbg-package-missing-depends for kdeutils (expecting kfloppy) at line 1
[05:50] <phoenix_firebrd> is the kde 4.10 sc tars ready?
[05:50] <shadeslayer> yup, I'm running the script right now
[05:51] <shadeslayer> should take another 30-40 minutes
[05:51] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[05:52] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: btw lintian.debian.org will also list packages that have a similar lintian error
[05:52] <shadeslayer> so if the package also exists there, you can ignore it
[05:54] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: pull-lp-source gives me kdiamond 4.9.98 you want this or 4.10
[05:54] <shadeslayer> use that for now
[05:54] <shadeslayer> or rather
[05:54] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[05:54] <shadeslayer> do you have kubuntu-dev-tools installed?
[05:54] <phoenix_firebrd> shall i finish my breakfast in 10 min?
[05:54] <shadeslayer> sure
[05:55] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[05:55] <shadeslayer> install kubuntu-dev-tools once you're done and run kbzr branch kdiamond
[05:55] <shadeslayer> in there, you'll find the latest packaging
[05:57] <phoenix_firebrd> i have done that already
[06:16] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: Can i edit the copyright file?
[06:19] <shadeslayer> sure
[06:30] <phoenix_firebrd> brb
[06:39] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok i soved the copyright issue for kdiamond what should i do
[06:40] <phoenix_firebrd> checking kfloppy
[06:40] <shadeslayer> install kubuntu-dev-tools , kbzr branch kdiamond , patch the copyright file and propose a merge on lp
[06:41] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[06:41] <shadeslayer> see https://code.launchpad.net/~kubuntu-packagers/kubuntu-packaging/kdiamond
[06:43] <phoenix_firebrd> what should be the version and release name i should specify in the change log?
[06:43] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ^
[06:43] <shadeslayer> don't
[06:44] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: just edit debian/copyright
[06:45] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[06:51] <shadeslayer> kdeplasma-addons: bzr unclean or out of sync
[06:51] <shadeslayer> wot
[06:57] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: done
[06:58] <shadeslayer> cool :)
[06:58] <phoenix_firebrd> are you going to merge it noe?
[06:58] <shadeslayer> in a bit
[06:58] <shadeslayer> I want to push 4.10 branches first
[06:58] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[06:59] <phoenix_firebrd> checking kfloppy
[06:59] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: there is a mistakle
[07:00] <shadeslayer> fix it :)
[07:00] <phoenix_firebrd> i have put "changelog" instead of "copyright" in changelog
[07:02] <shadeslayer> erm
[07:02] <shadeslayer> can not add an entry to the changelog?
[07:03] <shadeslayer> *can you 
[07:07] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: corrected the change log and summited for merge
[07:10] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: can you drop the changelog entry?
[07:10] <shadeslayer> not required
[07:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: but yofel told me to mention anything that is changed
[07:12] <shadeslayer> yes, anything major
[07:12] <shadeslayer> that's a trivial change
[07:12] <shadeslayer> can be skipped
[07:12] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok if you say so
=== jackyalcine_ is now known as JackyAlcine
[07:19] <phoenix_firebrd> debuild succeeds for kfloppy 4.9.98
[07:19] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ^
[07:20] <shadeslayer> look at the lintian output
=== Quintasan_ is now known as Quintasan
[07:21] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya i can see that, i have come across that yesterday
[07:21] <phoenix_firebrd> checking for a solution
[07:22] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: but thats a warning right?
[07:22] <shadeslayer> yup
[07:22] <Quintasan> mfw shadeslayer is tutoring someone
[07:22] <shadeslayer> heh
[07:23] <Quintasan> God
[07:23] <Quintasan> Gotta take a look at maliit-frameworks
[07:23] <Quintasan> duh
[07:23] <shadeslayer> erm
[07:23] <Quintasan>  wat
[07:23] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: you have diff markers now
[07:23] <yofel_> morning
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[07:24] <shadeslayer> hi yofel
[07:24] <yofel> bad shadeslayer not putting changes in changelog :P
[07:24] <yofel> anyway
[07:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: morning
[07:24] <shadeslayer> it's a trivial change! :P
[07:24] <yofel> yeah, vm
[07:24] <yofel> *nvm
[07:25] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: without that debuild gives me error
[07:25] <yofel> re that copyright issue: do the buildlogs have the lintian output in them?
[07:25] <shadeslayer> yofel: I think so
[07:25] <shadeslayer> and I'm thinking the same thing you are
[07:27] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i solved the tomboy-blogsposter error
[07:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: but i am not able to put the config  in place
[07:28] <yofel> shadeslayer: good :D - I'll try to write a check for it later
[07:29] <shadeslayer> okay, the buildd's don't have it
[07:30] <shadeslayer> the official ones
[07:31] <Quintasan> ☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭
[07:31] <jussi> hah
[07:31] <Quintasan> utf-8 ftw
[07:31] <jussi> good morning ladies and gents
[07:31] <Quintasan> wat
[07:31] <Quintasan> jussi
[07:31] <Quintasan> watwatwat
[07:31] <yofel> shadeslayer: hm, missing DH_VERBOSE?
[07:32] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: look who is here
[07:32] <jussi> Quintasan: which part didnt you understand? :D
[07:32] <shadeslayer> mmm
[07:32]  * jussi hides
[07:32] <yofel> od dh_lintian doesn't do a full check
[07:32] <Quintasan> jussi: I totally failed to comprehend the part where you show up on irc
[07:32] <Quintasan> :P
[07:32] <yofel> *or
[07:32] <yofel> ah, that's something else
[07:33] <shadeslayer> yofel: build logs show dh_lintian being run, but no output
[07:33] <Quintasan> jussi: don't hide on me, go to work!
[07:33] <Quintasan> :P
[07:34] <yofel> shadeslayer: yeah, but that's because it's just for copying the override files
[07:34] <yofel> so that's ok
[07:34] <shadeslayer> hm
[07:35] <shadeslayer> let's wait for kdiamond to build
[07:35] <yofel> http://yofel.dyndns.org/kubuntu/build_status_4.9.98_raring.html - I can't find anything in the logs
[07:37] <shadeslayer> yeah
[07:38] <shadeslayer> gosh, kdeartwork is huge
[07:40] <yofel> you don't say ;P
[07:40] <shadeslayer> hehe
[07:41] <yofel> kde-wallpapers is the new kdeartwork
[07:41] <yofel> and they don't seem to remove stuff from artwork anymore :/
[07:49] <shadeslayer> poor dpkg
[07:49] <shadeslayer> trying to install shank which is a 2GB deb
[07:51] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  i can't understand the clauses 9.1.1, 9.1.4, 9.5, 10.7.4, 11.8 in the standards version 3.9.3. I have checked and updated the rest
[07:52] <yofel> note: we don't really care about the policy version usually
[07:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[07:53] <yofel> the ubuntu-policy is still at 3.8.2, so that's all we really need to comply with
[07:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[07:53] <yofel> knowing the policy is good though ;)
[07:53] <yofel> as we do try to follow it, we just rarely update that number
[07:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: it seems that the package is upto the standards, sahall i bump the standards version?
[07:54] <shadeslayer> please don't bump standards
[07:54] <shadeslayer> unnecessary diff
[07:54] <shadeslayer> from debian that is
[07:55] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: why did you ask me to take a look at the lintian error?
[07:55] <shadeslayer> because it needs fixing?
[07:56] <shadeslayer> without bumping the standards version
[07:56] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: why not?
[07:56] <yofel> ^
[07:56] <shadeslayer> because it makes merging from debian easier
[07:56] <yofel> well, merging 4.10 will be fun anyway - if debian ever gets to package it in time for us
[07:56] <yofel> lag -.-
[07:57] <shadeslayer> why do you want to bump the standards version?
[07:57] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok in that case the package is updated to the new standards and i wont bump the version number so the lintian warning will remain , whats next?
[07:58]  * yofel wonders if importing debian git packaging into bzr and merging that would work
[07:58] <yofel> probably not
[07:58] <shadeslayer> wat
[07:58] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: next?
[07:58] <yofel> shadeslayer: nvm, me. I haven't had enough coffee yet :P
[08:01] <yofel> shadeslayer: hm, stuck at uploading kdeartwork?
[08:01] <shadeslayer> yofel: heh, yes kdiamond_4.10.0-0ubuntu1\~ubuntu13.04\~ppa1.dsc       
[08:01] <shadeslayer> erm
[08:01] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: after updating the package standards, what should i do?
[08:01] <yofel> heh, ok
[08:01] <shadeslayer> you shouldn't update standards!!
[08:02] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://i.imgur.com/IOF1XRz.png
[08:02] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: then what should i do with the lintian error?
[08:02] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: fix it? :P
[08:02] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: how?
[08:02] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: "W: kfloppy source: out-of-date-standards-version 3.9.2 (current is 3.9.3)"
[08:02] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thats the error
[08:03] <shadeslayer> whut
[08:03] <shadeslayer> not that one
[08:03] <shadeslayer> the other oen
[08:03] <shadeslayer> *one
[08:03] <shadeslayer> E: kfloppy source: malformed-override Override of dbg-package-missing-depends for kdeutils (expecting kfloppy) at line 1
[08:03] <shadeslayer> apparently we were talking about 2 different errors altogether :P
[08:03] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: you can ignore that warning
[08:04] <phoenix_firebrd> shit
[08:04] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i will look at the other one
[08:07] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i can see the error that you pointed in the debuild log http://paste.kde.org/661100/
[08:07] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: *i can't
[08:07] <shadeslayer> O_O
[08:07] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: version is 4.9.98
[08:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: am i wrong or what?
[08:08] <shadeslayer> lemme check
[08:08] <shadeslayer> yes
[08:09] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ??
[08:09] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/661106/
[08:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: may be this happens with v4.10
[08:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: how can i get the 4.10 tar?
[08:11] <shadeslayer> mmm
[08:11] <shadeslayer> you'll have to request access
[08:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: shall i try with the master?
[08:11] <shadeslayer> no
[08:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok
[08:12] <shadeslayer> who has admin access to ninjas?
[08:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: 
[08:12] <shadeslayer> Riddell and apachelogger 
[08:13] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: btw can you branch the packaging from bzr and use that?
[08:13] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: for kfloppy?
[08:13] <shadeslayer> yes
[08:13] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\
[08:18] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: about that error, just bzr rm the override file. kfloppy has no dbg package
[08:18] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[08:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: when i builddeb kfloppy  am getting this error "apt could not find the needed tarball.
[08:20] <phoenix_firebrd> "
[08:20] <yofel> yeah, because you don't have the 4.10 one :/
[08:21] <yofel> or are you building 4.9.98?
[08:21] <yofel> in that case you would be missing a deb-src line
[08:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: when i bzr branch kfloppy what would i get?
[08:22] <yofel> 4.10, nvm
[08:22] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so ?
[08:22] <yofel> wait
[08:22] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[08:24] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: pm
[08:25] <shadeslayer> yofel: stuck on uploading kdeartwork :|
[08:25] <shadeslayer>   Uploading kdeartwork_4.10.0.orig.tar.xz: 140132k/140133k
[08:25] <yofel> heh
[08:25] <yofel> o.O
[08:25] <yofel> wait and hope :/
[08:33] <shadeslayer> yeag
[08:37] <shadeslayer> :S
[08:38] <shadeslayer> I'll upload kdeartwork and oxygen separately
[08:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: I am not getting the error that you pointed for kfloppy 4.10 . here is the builddeb log http://paste.kde.org/661184/
[08:45] <soee> good morning
[08:46] <shadeslayer> hm
[08:46] <shadeslayer> lintian too old?
[08:46] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: what version of lintian are you running?
[08:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: 2.5.10.2
[08:47] <shadeslayer> can you check with 2.5.11?
[08:48]  * yofel as looking at the lintian changelog
[08:48] <yofel> wth is       - license-problem-json-evil
[08:48] <shadeslayer> lol
[08:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: is there a ppa for it?
[08:48] <shadeslayer> hmm
[08:49] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: try just pulling the deb from raring
[08:49] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: just grab the lintian deb from raring?
[08:49] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[08:51] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: yofel there is no amd64 build
[08:52] <shadeslayer> because it's an arch any package
[08:52] <shadeslayer> or was it arch all
[08:52] <yofel> all
[08:52] <shadeslayer> right
[08:52] <shadeslayer> I get confused easily between those two, always have to look it up 
[08:52]  * yofel suggests s/all/indep/ -.-
[08:52] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: standards 3.9.3 has an update for that
[08:53] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: update for what?
[08:53] <yofel> then again, all makes some sense syntactically
[08:53] <shadeslayer> right
[08:53] <shadeslayer> yofel: it makes sense if you also know about any
[08:53] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: directions for using all or any for the arch
[08:53] <shadeslayer> okay, and?
[08:54] <shadeslayer> new symbols in kdelibs? :(
[08:55] <phoenix_firebrd> i am getting that error now
[08:56] <phoenix_firebrd> as yofel said i am going to remove the override files
[08:56] <shadeslayer> wait what
[08:58] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  "about that error, just bzr rm the override file. kfloppy has no dbg package"
[08:59] <shadeslayer> I don't see a override file
[08:59] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: me too
[08:59] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i am going to check for the configs
[08:59] <shadeslayer> ahh nvm
[09:00] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: drop debian/source/lintian-overrides
[09:00] <phoenix_firebrd> right
[09:01] <shadeslayer> who's up for packaging ktp-desktop-applets?
[09:03] <yofel> you :P
[09:03] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: should i push to my branch and request a merge?
[09:03] <yofel> or phoenix_firebrd
[09:03] <shadeslayer> yep
[09:03] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok
[09:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sure
[09:04] <shadeslayer> I'm working on kde bits today
[09:04] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: just push to your branch and post the branch URL
[09:04] <shadeslayer> the sc bits
[09:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, just now i did for kdiamond
[09:05] <yofel> merge requests are just too much paperwork if we're already on IRC
[09:06] <shadeslayer> heh
[09:06] <shadeslayer> sometimes it's good to know the paperwork works ;)
[09:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am following what you taught me
[09:06] <yofel> yeah, I did teach him how to do it
[09:07] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: sure, but it's not really needed if we're already talking here. Merge requests make sense for complex reviews and when the reviewer isn't at hand
[09:08] <yofel> wth
[09:09] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok. here is the link https://code.launchpad.net/~murthy/kubuntu-packaging/kfloppy-4.10.0
[09:09] <yofel> "Not attempting to fix packaging branch ancestry, missing pristine tar data for version 4.9.98."
[09:09] <phoenix_firebrd> whats that error?
[09:09] <yofel> no idea, first time I see it
[09:10] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: which package?
[09:10] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: http://paste.kde.org/661196
[09:10] <yofel> a) please don't add empty changelog entries
[09:11] <phoenix_firebrd> omg
[09:11] <yofel> b) that doesn't look like the right fix
[09:11] <phoenix_firebrd> my head is getting heated
[09:11] <yofel> lol, calm down, no harm done
[09:11] <yofel> that's why we're doing the reviews
[09:12] <yofel> I think the problem here is that there's a missing empty line missing between the 2 copyright sections
[09:12] <yofel> s/missing//
[09:12] <kubotu> yofel meant: "I think the problem here is that there's a  empty line missing between the 2 copyright sections"
[09:12] <yofel> that's invalid syntax
[09:13] <yofel> see http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep5/
[09:13] <phoenix_firebrd> whom should i follow you or shadeslayer
[09:13]  * yofel reads backlog
[09:14] <yofel> he didn't tell you *how* to fix it
[09:14] <yofel> and you didn't fix it right
[09:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i uploaded with a changelog, asked me to remove it
[09:14] <yofel> the reason lintian complains about a duplicate field, is because each chunk in the copyright file is seperated by an empty line
[09:15] <yofel> as the line is missing both license declarations belong to the same paragraph, which is invalid
[09:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats ok
[09:15] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: hm, the changelog was still there though
[09:15] <yofel> did you forget to push maybe?
[09:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: should i meantion the copyright file change in the changelog?
[09:16] <yofel> probably not worth it
[09:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so  i don't have to update the change log now right?
[09:17] <yofel> or it would be an entry like "* Fix <lintian_error_name>"
[09:17] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: this is really all that should be needed for kdiamond: http://paste.kde.org/661202
[09:17] <phoenix_firebrd> i will be back in 2 mins
[09:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am back
[09:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can we take this step by step
[09:23] <yofel> hm, kfloppy:
[09:23] <yofel> - -- Rohan Garg <rohangarg@kubuntu.org>  Thu, 31 Jan 2013 11:18:16 +0530
[09:23] <yofel> + -- Prasad Murthy <phoenix_firebrd@yahoo.com>  Thu, 31 Jan 2013 11:18:16 +0530
[09:24] <yofel> you changed the dch behaviour? (just curious)
[09:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya
[09:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so that debuild will sign
[09:24] <yofel> aaaaah
[09:24] <yofel> wait, I have a workaround for that
[09:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: -us -uc?
[09:25] <yofel> no
[09:25] <yofel> in ~/.devscripts put: DEBSIGN_KEYID=2EC0A9FF, except with your keyid instead of mine
[09:25] <yofel> that'll force it to use your key and ignore the changelog entry
[09:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[09:26] <yofel> it's meant as a kind of safety measure, as you can always -us -uc and run debsing after that
[09:26] <yofel> but I find it mostly annoying
[09:27] <yofel> but back to the review: please don't *commit* such a change, as it's just unnecessary noise when reviewing
[09:27] <yofel> it's not wrong, and once you have commit permissions feel free to commit that, but for reviews it's just noise
[09:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[09:28] <shadeslayer> heh
[09:29] <shadeslayer> I just aliased debsign to debsign -kkey
[09:29] <yofel> well, that works too
[09:29] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: can you give me the syntax?
[09:30] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: I put alias debsign='debsign -kF2672094' in my zshrc
[09:30]  * shadeslayer rages at dput
[09:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have updated the ~/.devscripts , now going to look at the copyright file
[09:37] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: about the copyright file: a dep5 copyright file has roughly the same syntax as a control file regarding spaces and empty lines
[09:37] <yofel> the current one violates that
[09:37] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i can see that its missing an empty line
[09:37] <yofel> exactly
[09:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: but it says it detects duplicate field?
[09:38] <yofel> yeah, because the current paragraph has 2 License: fields (thanks to the missing line)
[09:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: oh
[09:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok i will update and upload
[09:39] <yofel> those are 2 paragraphs glued together causing a double definition
[09:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok

[09:50] <Riddell> ooh 142 new tars
[09:51] <Riddell> sheytan: you're onto them?
[09:51] <shadeslayer> if you meant me, then yes
[09:51] <shadeslayer> almost done
[09:51] <Riddell> tab completion fail
[09:52] <shadeslayer> still need to upload kdeplasma-addons, oxygen-icons, kde-wallpapers, and kdeartwork
[09:55] <Riddell> shadeslayer: you've got the bandwidth for that?
[09:55] <shadeslayer> I don't think so :P
[09:55] <shadeslayer> you're welcome to take over those 4 if you want
[09:56] <shadeslayer> kdeplasma-addons need fixing in bzr firsst

[10:01] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: thanks, merging that in

[10:01] <shadeslayer> new kdepim tarball as well btw
[10:02] <yofel> shadeslayer: I'm on that
[10:02] <shadeslayer> awesome
[10:02] <shadeslayer> I'll step out for a bit then
[10:05] <sheytan> no problem. Happens to few ppl :D
[10:05] <yofel> shadeslayer: when are you going to upload the rest?
[10:05] <yofel> https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ninjas/+archive/ppa/+packages?field.series_filter=raring&batch=200 shows plenty as missing
[10:05] <shadeslayer> yofel: already being uploaded
[10:06] <yofel> ah ok then
[10:06] <shadeslayer> it's uploading kstars at the moment
[10:06] <yofel> most of that'll be fast, I mostly want the libs up
[10:07] <shadeslayer> yep
[10:08] <shadeslayer> it's weird though, I've been throttled to about 512Kbps for uploads
[10:14] <Riddell> you should have asked for an ec2
[10:17]  * yofel wipes the old precise packages from ninjas to free some space up
[10:21] <shadeslayer> Riddell: too much of a hassle to setup and then everything downloaded at a good rate of 2 Mbps
[10:23] <apachelogger> make it a charm
[10:23] <apachelogger> \o/
[10:23]  * apachelogger is using words he does not understand now
[10:23] <shadeslayer> heh
[10:23] <Riddell> actually I went to the cloud dev room at the last uds and tried to do that and it wasn't possible
[10:23] <Riddell> seems copying a gpg key to a ec2 is too complex or something
[10:24] <shadeslayer> 0.o
[10:24] <shadeslayer> you're kidding right?
[10:24] <apachelogger> eh
[10:24] <apachelogger> Riddell: remotesign
[10:24] <apachelogger> also I doubt the key is the only thing you need
[10:24] <Riddell> yeah we got stuck in a few places
[10:25] <Riddell> juju is surprisingly complex just to do what a simple bash script can easily do
[10:25] <apachelogger> well
[10:25] <apachelogger> formalizing always comes at a price ^^
[10:26] <Riddell> yes and there will be reasons for that complexity, it's just a shame that it's complex even for a juju developer
[10:36] <shadeslayer> ok everything is up
[10:38] <Riddell> what to do about l10n?
[10:39] <Riddell> just throw it up on release day? or faff around with putting in a PPA and probably running out of space
[10:39] <shadeslayer> just throw it up on release day, fix as needed

[11:13]  * yofel -> lunch
[11:20] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[11:23] <phoenix_firebrd> BluesKaj: hi
[11:24] <BluesKaj> hi phoenix_firebrd
[11:29] <Riddell> shadeslayer: hmm you probably did sensible, uploading from an ec2 to launchpad seems to be uber slow
[11:30] <shadeslayer> heh
[11:30] <shadeslayer> use my server?
[11:35] <yofel> you could've used mine...
[11:36] <yofel> then again, that was starved for bandwidth too earlier
[11:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: tomboy-blogposter builds
[11:47] <vHanda> yofel: Removing a private function breaks ABI?
[11:47] <vHanda> are you sure?
[11:48] <yofel> is that Private?
[11:48] <yofel> if it is then nevermind, but it doesn't obviously look private to me
[11:50] <apachelogger> vHanda: removing a private function always breaks ABI
[11:50] <apachelogger> the impact of it depends on other factors though (for example whether the class/function is virtual)
[11:51] <Riddell> you can "remove private non-virtual functions if they are not called by any inline functions (and have never been). " says http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Binary_Compatibility_Issues_With_C++
[11:52] <Riddell> that one is a "private Q_SLOTS:"
[11:52] <Riddell> so that's fine I think
[11:52] <apachelogger> it still breaks the ABI, it is however a binary compatible change
[11:53] <Riddell> is it ABI if it's a bit of the interface you can't use?
[11:53] <apachelogger> (the restrictedness of when it is a ok to remove a private is why one should generally avoid having privates)
[11:53] <apachelogger> Riddell: you can use it
[11:55] <apachelogger> ABI is really no philosophical topic :)
[11:55] <Riddell> hmm
[11:55] <apachelogger> BC is to some extent ^^
[11:55] <Riddell> anyway yofel you'll handle that?
[11:55] <apachelogger> Riddell: on the library level there is no difference between private and public
[11:55] <apachelogger> so I could link to the privates all the same
[11:56] <Riddell> '#define private public' is evil!
[11:56] <yofel> yeah, as soon as apachelogger is finished explaining...
[11:56] <apachelogger> actually let me speed this up
[11:56] <vHanda> yofel: Do you want me to add the private slot again?
[11:56] <apachelogger> whenever a binary interface disappears the change breaks ABI :P
[11:56] <apachelogger> whether that binary interface was from a private or not does not matter in that regard
[11:57] <apachelogger> </storymode>
[11:57] <Riddell> vHanda: no it's fine
[11:57] <vHanda> yofel: I'll have to run it by the release team
[11:57] <vHanda> oh
[11:57] <Riddell> apachelogger is just confusing matters!
[11:58] <yofel> ok, he did manage to confuse me at least
[11:58] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: how so? aren't privates not supposed to be exposed in the symbols file?
[11:58] <Riddell> yes the symbol has gone, no nothing uses it, so there's no problem
[11:58] <apachelogger> :(
[11:58] <apachelogger> Riddell: it's a library
[11:58] <apachelogger> the statement nothing uses it is simply wrong
[11:58] <yofel> so what would use it?
[11:58] <apachelogger> anything can use it so we must assume something uses it
[11:58] <yofel> outside of the library
[11:58] <shadeslayer> but if it's private, how can something use it?
[11:59] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: #define private public
[11:59] <apachelogger> #include <yourlib.h>
[11:59] <shadeslayer> bah
[11:59] <shadeslayer> if you do that
[11:59] <shadeslayer> then that
[11:59] <apachelogger> Foo foo; foo.yourprivates();
[11:59] <shadeslayer> then that's just shit 
[11:59] <shadeslayer> and evil
[11:59] <vHanda> apachelogger: That's a neat trick. I didn't know you could do that!
[11:59] <yofel> I'm fairly certain we don't support *that*
[11:59] <apachelogger> it does not matter!
[11:59] <apachelogger> when talking about ABI any time you retract an interface it is breaking ABI
[12:00] <apachelogger> when talking about BC if you decided to link against a private then that is your fault
[12:00] <Riddell> vHanda: now you're just winding us up!
[12:00] <yofel> I think we can conclude that this is BC and go on with our lives
[12:00] <Riddell> yofel++
[12:01] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[12:01] <yofel> vHanda: so, sorry for the more or less false alarm
[12:01] <vHanda> uhm, okay. I'm still preparing a patch just in case someone else objects.
[12:02] <vHanda> The tarballs aren't going to get re-spun until monday
[12:02] <vHanda> so we have till then to decide if this should be fixed.
[12:03] <vHanda> http://paste.kde.org/661370
[12:04] <apachelogger> vHanda: btw, not sure if kde wants to use it but there is Q_PRIVATE_SLOT
[12:06] <apachelogger> it allows you to pass the slot call to the d ptr
[12:06] <apachelogger> and it expands to nothing in c++ so you end up having no symbol for the slot as the slot is entirely handled via the qmetaobject 
[12:08] <Riddell> useful note: ec2's in ireland upload to launchpad much faster than those in the US
[12:19] <shadeslayer> Riddell: isn't LP based out of the UK
[12:19] <shadeslayer> like, hosted somewhere in the UK
[12:19] <Riddell> yes, london
[12:20] <Riddell> I remember persia saying he would never use UDD because bzr takes many days to do a checkout from launchpad
[12:20] <Riddell> for him in japan
[12:21] <Riddell> however ec2s are more expensive in ireland, despite being in a tax haven
[12:22]  * yofel times checking out kde-worspace just for fun
[12:24] <yofel> hm, ~70MB in about a minute, not as bad as I feared
[12:42] <Riddell> bah my addition of QextSerialPort to marble didn't get pushed
[12:44] <Riddell> ah yofel is on the case, good good

[12:54] <smartboyhw> Good evening
[12:54] <Riddell> hi smartboyhw 
[12:54] <smartboyhw> Hi Riddell 
[12:54] <Riddell> 4.10.0 being packaged
[12:54] <Riddell> http://notes.kde.org/kubuntu-ninjas
[12:55] <smartboyhw> Riddell, that is good:)
[12:55] <shadeslayer> Riddell: hm, odd, I thought S3 was *cheaper* in Ireland
[12:55] <shadeslayer> which was one of the reasons we chose the instance to be in Ireland
[12:56] <shadeslayer> as for bzr, it's painfully slow :(
[12:57] <yofel> weird bug of the day: bug 1111364

[12:58] <yofel> then there is bug 1107692 which is quantal-only too, happens only with the digikam-rc and I don't get what the issue is

[12:58] <Riddell> smartboyhw: yes please
[12:58] <smartboyhw> Riddell, well request sync bug then:p
[12:58] <yofel> don't forget about libktorrent
[12:59] <smartboyhw> Don't know that it is maintained by Debian side
[12:59] <yofel>  libktorrent | 1.3.1-1         | experimental      | source
[12:59] <BluesKaj> system settings crashes when opening user management
[12:59] <smartboyhw> How do you request syncs?
[12:59] <yofel> BluesKaj: still?
[12:59] <yofel> BluesKaj: and with what backtrace?
[13:00] <yofel> (I'm not surprised that it doesn't work, but it shouldn't *crash*)
[13:01] <BluesKaj> ok yofel . I was mistaken , noe I get the "orphaned module " message 
[13:01] <BluesKaj> now
[13:01] <yofel> ah ok, then it crashed once to reload the lib
[13:01] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I think it will be up to the sponsors to do the actual syncing of ktorrent....So probably it will be difficult for me to do it
[13:03] <BluesKaj> well , yofel I still don't have access 
[13:04] <yofel> BluesKaj: that's because the userconfig module doesn't work with python3. 
[13:04] <yofel> that'll be the next thing to do
[13:04] <BluesKaj> ok , thanks yofel
[13:05] <yofel> which reminds me...
[13:06] <Riddell> smartboyhw: I can do that if you file the bugs
[13:06] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ok:)
[13:14] <yofel> ScottK: any ideas about this: http://paste.kde.org/661502 - that's caused by ki18n() when using python3
[13:16] <yofel> ki18n("Sebastian Kügler".encode('utf-8')) works, but we can hardly do that for all utf-8 strings
[13:18] <smartboyhw> Riddell, can't seem to find whether ktorrent is in Debian experimental main or non-free or anything else....
=== Tonio__ is now known as Tonio_aw
[13:19] <yofel> smartboyhw: it's in experimental http://paste.kde.org/661580
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio__
[13:19] <smartboyhw> yofel, experimental I know, but is it main or non-free?
[13:20] <Riddell> smartboyhw: packages.debian.org is your friend
[13:20] <smartboyhw> The Sync wiki page says I need to include that...
[13:20] <smartboyhw> Riddell, searching through packages.debian.org and I still can't find it...
[13:20] <Riddell> if it doesn't say anything it'll be in main
[13:20] <smartboyhw> Riddell, main then
[13:23] <yofel> ScottK: note that the utf-8 issue above is python3.2, I'll try it later with 3.3

[13:54] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I do see some build failures...
[13:54] <smartboyhw> No access to build logs though...
[13:54] <yofel> those should just be archive skew I belive (libkdeedu related)
[13:56] <Riddell> smartboyhw: oh I'll put you in the team
[13:56] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ooh?
[13:57] <Riddell> we're not precious about it :)   it's only hidden because upstream wants it hidden until release 
[13:57] <yofel> Riddell: mind adding phonix_firebird too unless you think he needs more time? I'll tell him what not to do later then
[13:57] <Riddell> yofel: what's his username?
[13:57] <yofel> ~murthy
[13:58] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ok
[13:58] <smartboyhw> thx
[13:58] <Riddell> voila
[13:58] <yofel> thanks :)
[13:58] <smartboyhw> libkmajjongglib-dev failed...
[13:59] <yofel> archive skew, just retry the build
[13:59] <yofel> hm, having a link to the build from the status page would be nice...
[14:01] <smartboyhw> Weird, why is ksnakeduel i386 showing a failure, when the logs said it is perfectly built?
[14:02] <yofel> smartboyhw: list-missing should be empty
[14:02] <yofel> but in this case the output looks weird
[14:02] <smartboyhw> Lots of .png and .desktop files
[14:03] <yofel> wth
[14:04] <yofel> ah no, makes sense
[14:04] <yofel> smartboyhw: a transitional package was added which is only built on i386 as it's arch "all", but nobody added an install file for ksnakeduel
[14:05] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh should I add one?
[14:05] <yofel> so the package needs ksnakeduel.install with "usr/*" in it
[14:05] <yofel> smartboyhw: yeah, but please do so in bzr as well
[14:05] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK
[14:06] <smartboyhw> yofel, where is the branch?
[14:06] <yofel> smartboyhw: usually it's best to add it in bzr and generate the package from there
[14:06] <yofel> smartboyhw: do you have kubuntu-dev-tools installed?
[14:06] <yofel> then it's just 'kbzr co ksnakeduel"
[14:06]  * smartboyhw finds himself a total idiot today
[14:07] <yofel> hey, everyone was new at some point ;P
[14:09] <yofel> *sigh*
[14:09]  * yofel goes fixing kolabxml properly
[14:09] <smartboyhw> Why I couldn't install the ppa for kubuntu-dev-tools?
[14:10] <smartboyhw> Cannot access PPA (https://launchpad.net/api/1.0/~bulldog98/+archive/kubuntu-dev-tool) to get PPA information, please check your internet connection.
[14:10] <smartboyhw> *sigh* use the manual method then
[14:13] <yofel> that's weird o.O
[14:14] <smartboyhw> yofel, anyway got it now, syncing
[14:20] <smartboyhw> yofel, added. Which place should I upload the branch to?
[14:21] <yofel> if you're not a kubuntu-member yet, put it in lp:~<your_id>/kubuntu-packaging/ksnakeduel-4.10 or so
[14:21] <yofel> then give me the url

[14:23] <smartboyhw> !?
[14:23] <yofel> ah, run 'bzr unbind' first. Checkout binds commit to the original launchpad location
[14:24] <yofel> forgot about that. Next time use 'kbzr branch <pkg>'
[14:24] <smartboyhw> OK
[14:24] <yofel> either that ^ or launchpad doesn't know you or your ssh key

[14:26] <yofel> smartboyhw: please add something to the changelog too, just run 'dch' in the branch dir and it'll add you to the current entry
[14:27] <yofel> smartboyhw: ah wait
[14:27] <smartboyhw> !?
[14:27] <smartboyhw> Almost added it:P
[14:27] <yofel> nevermind, the entry is already there (see 4.9.98), Riddell just didn't actually add the file to bzr...
[14:28] <smartboyhw> yofel, :O
[14:28] <yofel> well, happens
[14:29] <yofel> merged
[14:29] <smartboyhw> yofel, thx
[14:29] <yofel> smartboyhw: now update the packagin in the PPA so it gets a clean status
[14:29] <yofel> *package
[14:30] <smartboyhw> yofel, so I bzr builddeb -S and upload it to PPA?
[14:30] <smartboyhw> Or anything?
[14:30] <yofel> first add ~ubuntu13.04~ppa2 to the version, change UNRELEASED to raring, then upload after bzr builddeb -S -- -sd
[14:30] <yofel> but don't commit those changes
[14:31] <smartboyhw> yofel: OK
[14:34] <smartboyhw> yofel, when you mean commit you mean locally?
[14:34] <yofel> yeah, bzr builddeb will use uncomitted changes
[14:35] <yofel> ok, with new libkolabxml kdepim-runtime will only need a simple retry in a bit

[15:21] <phoenix_firebrd> nice
[15:21] <phoenix_firebrd> thank you very much
[15:22] <yofel> so now you can actually see https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ninjas/+archive/ppa/+packages?field.series_filter=raring&batch=200
[15:22] <yofel> and open the build logs on http://yofel.dyndns.org/kubuntu/build_status_4.10.0_raring.html
[15:22] <phoenix_firebrd> checking
[15:22] <shadeslayer> only with FF though
[15:23] <yofel> lol
[15:23] <shadeslayer> with chrom{e,ium} you can't open the build logs
[15:23] <phoenix_firebrd> why so?
[15:23] <shadeslayer> I have FF installed just so that I can look at the build logs
[15:23] <shadeslayer> bug in LP / Chrome
[15:23] <shadeslayer> not sure which
[15:23] <yofel> smartboyhw, phoenix_firebrd: one thing about ~kubuntu-ninjas membership: it also grants you upload rights to kubuntu-ppa/*, please be careful there
[15:23] <phoenix_firebrd> omg
[15:23] <phoenix_firebrd> sure
[15:24] <phoenix_firebrd> do i get a email id too?
[15:24] <yofel> no, that's for kubuntu members
[15:24] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[15:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i not touch the kubuntu-ppa until you find me fit
[15:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: *i will not
[15:25] <shadeslayer> yofel: question time btw
[15:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: are you free now?
[15:26] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: what time do you go to bed?
[15:26] <yofel> not too much, but a quick question's ok
[15:26] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: I don't think shadeslayer goes to bed
[15:26] <smartboyhw> yofel, ok
[15:26] <shadeslayer> :P
[15:26] <phoenix_firebrd> wow
[15:27] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so thats why the nick?
[15:27] <shadeslayer> it's quite random actually, anything between 10 PM to 5 AM
[15:27] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: my sleep cycle was like yours 1 month before, just had it reset
[15:27] <shadeslayer> heh
[15:28] <Riddell> + [laney] get maliit in the archive: DONE
[15:28] <Riddell> ooh, well done Quintasan 
[15:28] <shadeslayer> my sleep cycle changes every 2 weeks
[15:28] <yofel> what
[15:28] <yofel> \o/
[15:28] <yofel> Quintasan++
[15:28] <shadeslayer> nice :)
[15:28] <Riddell> very generous of Quintasan to let laney take all the credit
[15:28] <shadeslayer> so now we have a keyboard , but no declarative-plasmoids 
[15:29] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i was observing the actives in this channel from the morning, I can't figure out the procedure of tagging 
[15:29] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: tagging is meant as "create git tags in KDE svn/git and spin tarballs from that"
[15:29] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: mine shifts 1 hr everyday, delayed sleep syndrome
[15:29]  * shadeslayer looks that up
[15:30] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: the kde-release-team folks do that, we just get the tars after that
[15:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, thats right
[15:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so did the tars are available for packaging?
[15:31] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: the 4.10.0 release is a week away, till then the release team may re-spin some tarballs if some bugfixes need to get in
[15:31] <yofel> pretty much
[15:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[15:31] <yofel> actually, kdepim got recreated today for that reaosn
[15:31] <yofel> *reason
[15:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the argument about the ABI?
[15:31] <yofel> that's why you'll find kdepim 4.10.0a in the ppa as that's the only way for us to update it
[15:32] <yofel> no, that was something different
[15:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: if i am not mistaken the pim stuff is always problematic?
[15:33] <shadeslayer> heh no
[15:33] <yofel> well, a bit
[15:33] <yofel> shadeslayer: seems we disagree :P
[15:33] <shadeslayer> depends on what you call problematic :P
[15:33] <yofel> but maybe i just have a trauma from uploading kdepim 4.7
[15:33] <shadeslayer> I call it unusable xD
[15:33] <yofel> lol
[15:33] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i mostly see a known issue that saying about pim stuff
[15:33] <shadeslayer> I simply cannot import all of my email into KMail
[15:33] <yofel> well, it's not that bad, it just doesn't scale
[15:34] <shadeslayer> right, it doesn't scale
[15:34] <shadeslayer> it'll just take a batshit amount of time to import my email 
[15:34] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: with respinning tars I mean this btw. http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/release-team/2013-January/006809.html
[15:34] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i like kdepim
[15:34] <yofel> oh right, talking about mailing lists
[15:35] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: my first patch was for akonadi backup
[15:35] <yofel> there's 2 that are relevant here: release-team@kde.org, which is mostly not interesting for us, but public. Then there's kde-packager@kde.org which is relevant to us but private to packagers
[15:35] <yofel> we need to get you added to the 2nd one eventually
[15:35] <yofel> same with smartboyhw
[15:35] <shadeslayer> actually the release team does get cc'd for the tars right?
[15:36] <shadeslayer> kde-packagers is mostly irrelevant from what I gathered at Akademy
[15:36] <yofel> yeah, tsdgeos always sends the mails to packager, release-team, and qa
[15:36] <yofel> it does feel a bit deprecated lately...
[15:36] <shadeslayer> it does have the odd interesting discussion ;)
[15:36] <shadeslayer> s/odd/occassional/
[15:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:should i join this now ? kde-packager@kde.org
[15:37] <kubotu> shadeslayer meant: "it does have the occassional interesting discussion ;)"
[15:37] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: you'll have to open a sysadmin bug report
[15:37] <shadeslayer> and ask Riddell to ack it
[15:37] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: am i qualified?
[15:38] <shadeslayer> qualified for what? reading emails? idk you tell me :D
[15:38] <yofel> release-team has more fun discussions lately
[15:38] <yofel> http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/release-team/2013-January/date.html
[15:38] <phoenix_firebrd> :D
[15:39] <phoenix_firebrd> so which one should i join now?
[15:39] <shadeslayer> both
[15:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I have successfully built the tomboy-blogposter, can you check my build log?
[15:39] <yofel> then release-team will be enough for now
[15:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[15:40] <yofel> bug Riddell about packagers sometime
[15:40] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: as I said, I don't know enough about mono packages to QA that
[15:40] <shadeslayer> #ubuntu-motu
[15:41] <shadeslayer> that channel probably has mono ninjas lurking in every corner
[15:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no just the common errors
[15:41] <yofel> not now then, maybe I'll have some time later
[15:42] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: its just that i am not confident enough to assume that i have suceeded in building this 
[15:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats ok
[15:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: if its not a problem can i put it in my ppa?
[15:43] <shadeslayer> well
[15:43] <shadeslayer> there's #ubuntu-packaging
[15:43] <phoenix_firebrd> what for?
[15:43] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: sure, but if you already want a review you might as well get someone competent to do it
[15:43] <shadeslayer> it's a channel specifically for people starting out with packaging
[15:44] <yofel> s/starting out//
[15:44] <kubotu> yofel: You did something wrong... Try s/you/me/ or tell me "help sed"
[15:44] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh what did I miss?
[15:44] <shadeslayer> yofel: people with packaging? :D
[15:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: more like a patient one
[15:44] <yofel> err... yeah :D
[15:45] <yofel> smartboyhw: the mailing lists you might care about if you plan to work on kde sc releases
[15:45] <smartboyhw> yofel, ok
[15:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  shadeslayer . tomboy-blogposter log http://paste.kde.org/661886/
[15:48] <phoenix_firebrd> "Compilation succeeded - 2 warning(s)" does that mean i have a binary?
[15:48] <shadeslayer> looks fine
[15:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  wow
[15:48] <shadeslayer> but don't take my word for it
[15:49] <yofel> the build worked, whether the package works I don't know
[15:49] <shadeslayer> that ^
[15:49]  * yofel broke libkolabxml
[15:49] <yofel> bah
[15:49] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i have been repeatedly bulding this from 2 days, atleast it build now, i will check it deeply further
[15:50] <shadeslayer> kewl
[15:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what did you do?
[15:50] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: kewl , the hindi word?
[15:50] <yofel> I made it libkolabxml-dev depend on the libs that its cmake config file wants. But libcurl4 has more than just the gnutls variant
[15:51] <yofel> which causes conflicts
[15:51] <shadeslayer> kewl is a hindi word? drat
[15:51] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: causing https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ninjas/+archive/ppa/+build/4261395/+files/buildlog_ubuntu-raring-i386.kdepim-runtime_4%3A4.10.0-0ubuntu1%7Eubuntu13.04%7Eppa1_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz
[15:51] <shadeslayer> I need to stop using that word, urban dictionary has a definition for it :|
[15:52] <shadeslayer> ... and it's not pretty
[15:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: getting a 404
[15:52] <yofel> then you don't use firefox :D
[15:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: chromium
[15:52] <yofel> https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ninjas/+archive/ppa/+build/4261394
[15:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: let me check with ff
[15:53] <shadeslayer> like I said
[15:53]  * yofel uploaded a fix in the meantime
[15:53] <shadeslayer> everything except rekonq and FF fails
[15:53] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ha ha ha
[15:53] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the urban dictionary 
[15:54] <shadeslayer> :P
[15:54] <smartboyhw> yofel, suscribed to release-team
[15:54] <smartboyhw> good night everyone!
[15:58] <phoenix_firebrd> going to register for the mailing list
[16:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  this one kde-packager@kde.org  or this one release-team@kde.org ?
[16:01] <phoenix_firebrd> I saw Riddell uds 2012 interview and i am very inspired
[16:02] <yofel> well, both
[16:02] <yofel> packagers would be enough for your purposes I guess
[16:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[16:02] <shadeslayer> for the former you need to open a sysadmin bug report
[16:03] <yofel> but some people don't make a distinction there
[16:03] <shadeslayer> and ask Riddell to vet it
[16:04] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: ooh where is that?
[16:04] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: youtube
[16:04] <phoenix_firebrd> r^
[16:04] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: ^
[16:04] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: I feel like you have become a celeb for some of us
[16:05] <shadeslayer> heh, I was sitting a couple of feet from Riddell when he gave that interview
[16:05] <shadeslayer> Riddell: you haven't seen it yet? :P
[16:05] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: awesome
[16:06] <Riddell> for any fans, I'll be signing copies of my autobiography at FOSDEM this weekend http://open-advice.org/
[16:06] <shadeslayer> lol
[16:06] <yofel> :D
[16:06] <BluesKaj> ...BBL
[16:06] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: with a gpg key?
[16:07] <Riddell> yeah less wrist strain that way :)
[16:07] <phoenix_firebrd> for the pdf
[16:08] <Riddell> Blizzzek: you guys coming to fosdem?
[16:08] <phoenix_firebrd> the most inspiring was how people came forward to contribute to kubuntu and how the team handles them
[16:08] <Blizzzek> Riddell: at least Frank and Björn will be there

[16:37] <shadeslayer> did you open a bug report on bugs.kde.org
[16:37] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: no without that?
[16:37] <shadeslayer> nope then
[16:37] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: why so?
[16:38] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: is this an elite list?

[16:39] <shadeslayer> https://bugs.kde.org/enter_sysadmin_request.cgi?component=packager
[16:39] <shadeslayer> since the tarballs are only released to a certain subset of packagers

[16:44] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: filed a request

[17:19] <yofel> ktorrent and rekonq are done
[17:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: shall i try libmtp?
[17:22] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: you can see if there's anything to package there I'm not sure there is
[17:22] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: you could, that's shadeslayer's expertise I believe
[17:22] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: sorry , i just saw your mail now, i am getting accustomed to the work flow  
[17:23] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: and as Riddell says, the packaging notepad linked in the topic points to the packaging todo's

[17:23] <yofel> if you find something in the wild that needs to be done add it there
