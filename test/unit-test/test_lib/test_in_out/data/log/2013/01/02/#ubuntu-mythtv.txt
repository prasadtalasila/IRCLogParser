[07:23] <Technophil> Hi, I am trying to run up a new 0.23 mythbuntu frontend on 10.04, however I can't seem to get the last 0.23 version, instead it updates to 24158 with protocol 56.  Can one / how does one update to the last 0.23 image?

[16:08] <tgm4883> Technophil, did you activate the 0.23.1 repo or the 0.23.0 repo?
[17:39] <Technophil>  tgm4883: Thanks, I think I get it - I need to install the repo update option as a separate download.
