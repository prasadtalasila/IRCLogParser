[02:20] <fmjunkie> Hello?
[02:22] <frustratedtech> Hello :D
[02:23] <fmjunkie> Can someone please help me? I am running Xubuntu 12.04 and during the installation I chose for it to login automatically. Well i want to change that now, but I can't figure out how?

[02:28] <frustratedtech> fmjunkie, http://xubuntu.org/news/faq-1204-precise/ Look at #7
[02:29] <fmjunkie> ok i am looking thanks
[02:47] <fmjunkie> I can't save changes to lightdm.conf
[02:48] <fmjunkie> its read only and i can't change that in the drop down list
[02:48] <well_laid_lawn> use sudo or gksudo
[02:48] <well_laid_lawn> !gksudo
[02:48] <ubottu> If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[03:15] <fmjunkie> ok got it thanks
[03:16] <well_laid_lawn> np ;)
[03:17] <fmjunkie> Does Xubuntu start a firewall on startup? I downloaded "Firestarter" when I open it it will place an icon in my system tray but only if I do it manually. So I have no confirmation that there is a firewall running otherwise.
[03:18] <frustratedtech> A firewall for what?
[03:22] <fmjunkie> For my internet connection
[03:23] <kgb> fmjunkie: UFW is teh firewall (front-end)
[03:23] <frustratedtech> But what are you trying to block?
[03:23] <kgb> *ufw
[03:23] <well_laid_lawn> I've only run a firewall on a webserver - a linux desktop doesn't need one imo
[03:23] <well_laid_lawn> !ufw
[03:23] <ubottu> Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo | GUI frontends such as Gufw (GNOME) and Guarddog (KDE from Lucid onwards) also exist.
[03:23] <kgb> fmjunkie: sudo ufw enable
[03:24] <kgb> oh well_laid_lawn, gufw doesn't have an icon on Xubuntu 12.10 (still)
[03:25] <kgb> .. in the Settings Manager, it just shows as text: Firewall Configuration
[03:25] <fmjunkie> well I am new to Linux but I have always ran a firewall with win 7 just to stop any unwanted traffic.
[03:26] <well_laid_lawn> I know nothing about it
[03:26] <frustratedtech> LOL, Windows needs more than a firewall
[03:26] <kgb> fmjunkie: a huge deficit of *nix is that there's no such thing as a rule-based firewall wuth prompts :(
[03:26] <kgb> *with prompts
[03:27] <kgb> like, for example, on Windows - the Comodo firewall can be configured to prompt each time an application tries to connect (not so by default)
[03:28] <frustratedtech> fmjunkie, are you running a router or going straight into a modem?
[03:28] <kgb> .. this is @ the very TOP of my wishlist :f
[03:28] <fmjunkie> router
[03:28] <kgb> (and also, probably, never going to happen unfortunately)
[03:29] <frustratedtech> I've got tons of ports open on my desktop and hardwired into a router.  If people are trying to get to my local nginx they wont be able to cuz the router doesn't know where to route the port 80 request
[03:30] <kgb> yea, router-secured is one of the best ways 2 go
[03:30] <kgb> almost as good as having a dedicted-firewall box
[03:30] <kgb> *dedicated
[03:31] <frustratedtech> I'm just using a basic netgear.  no fancy settings.  It's just that if your router isn't allowing incoming port connections, then a firewall on your xubuntu install is pointless
[03:32] <fmjunkie> Ok so there is no need for a software firewall on linux??
[03:32] <kgb> there is!..
[03:32] <kgb> :)
[03:33] <kgb> imo software can be exploited, just like on any other system ;$
[03:34] <fmjunkie> well I am not sure what to do now as i have never used anything outside of windows.... and even then I would just use a anti-virus program and a 3rd party firewall.. so what is the basic security measures I should take with Xubuntu?
[03:35] <kgb> fmjunkie: sudo ufw enable for starters :)
[03:35] <kgb> *blocks incoming, supposedly
[03:36] <heraclitis> I don't believe it does. I've noticed you have to configure manually to truly affect the iptables. I prefer to configure directly with iptables.
[03:36] <kgb> ya..
[03:36] <kgb> but better than *nothing* i suppose
[03:37] <frustratedtech> its not if you dont have rules
[03:37] <frustratedtech> but if you dont know what rules to use then why bother?
[03:38] <kgb> exactly, it's practically useless for newbies :(
[03:39] <kgb> years and years without a *proper* firewall, but I always keep hoping
[03:56] <fmjunkie> Well thanks for the Help,, Cya

[09:49] <Novarg> hey guys,I'm trying to boot a xubuntu from a usb stick. I installed it from the live cd using a typical installation, simply to the usb stick instead of the harddrive. but it just won't boot on its own. parted magic from another stick however DOES boot and I can abuse its boot manager to boot my xubuntu stick :)
[09:49] <Novarg> any ideas how I could get it to boot from the actual stick itself? it's partitioned with a boot partition mounted at /boot and a bigger root partition at /
[09:50] <Novarg> (because I read that syslinux might cough up on too large partitions)

[12:35] <filantropus> I don't know how to create users from xubuntu
[12:36] <sonkey4> settings -> users & groups -> add
[12:36] <filantropus> the thing is
[12:37] <filantropus> that, users & group item dosn't appear
[12:38] <GridCube> are you an administrator?
[12:39] <filantropus> nope. How can i make that?
[12:40] <GridCube> you need to talk to your system administrator then
[12:40] <filantropus> I'm
[12:40] <filantropus> i have the passwords to do it.
[12:41] <filantropus> but i dont know how to make my own user, administrator user.
[12:41] <GridCube> it should ask you the root password on the users and groups configuration program
[12:42] <filantropus> the thing is
[12:42] <filantropus> that users and groups item dos'nt appear

[12:48] <GridCube> sudo reboot
[12:49] <GridCube> oh, alt-f2
[12:50] <GridCube> or ctrl-alt-f1 to f6 will send you to a tty
[12:52] <GridCube> KeyboardNotFound, also the meta key (the one usually whit the windows logo) and T, should bring a terminal up too
[12:59] <bullgard4> Clicking on the Xfce menu to invoke GParted, I obtain: "Unable to get keyboard and mouse grab." What does it mean to »get keyboard grab«?

[15:00] <NickRivers> Hello. How would I get the home folder icon on the desktop to point to nautilus instead of Thunar. The default file manager is set to nautilus and the home folder icon from the bottom bar points to nautilus, but I still want to be able to use the desktop icon. Any suggestions?
[15:01] <GridCube> make a launcher for nautilus
[15:02] <NickRivers> Haha, why didn't I think of that... Thanks
[15:25] <TheSheep> NickRivers: let nautilus manage your desktop instead of xfdesktop
[15:35] <NickRivers> TheSheep: Nautilus has taken over, thanks

[17:26] <ubottu> The hardware requirements for Xubuntu can be found at http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/
[17:26] <baizon> xubuntu647: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements
[17:27] <xubuntu647> it gives the requirements for version 12.04 not 12.10
[17:27] <GridCube> its the same
[17:27] <xubuntu647> I need 12.10 .
[17:28] <baizon> xubuntu647: 12.10 got the same as 12.04
[17:29] <xubuntu647> you mean there was an update and the system requirements are the same , that's odd !!
[17:31] <holstein> xubuntu647: not really.. its arguably an "update"
[17:31] <holstein> xubuntu647: its newer or different packages
[17:32] <holstein> xubuntu647: there are no commercial entities in charge of making sure your system becomes "obsolete" either
[17:35] <GridCube> xubuntu647, its not odd, its pretty common
[17:35] <baizon> this isnt windows!
[17:36] <holstein> sometimes, system requirements become "better" or lowere.. i know with win7 even that was the case iirc

If I do a screen /dev/ttyS[0-4] can't get any input from the touchscreen. Already did $ modprobe -r usbtouchscreen and still doesn't detect, any ideas what's the problem?
[18:54] <recon_lap> LIDH well there is hope, but that a very specific problem. have you had any luck working out what driver you need?

[19:20] <xubuntu056> hi all I'm new at linux OS and I have no idea how to install xubuntu, any help
[19:20] <GridCube> xubuntu056, depends on how new its your computer
[19:21] <GridCube> if its too new it might be fairly complicated sadly, if its fairly old its a piece of cake
[19:22] <xubuntu056> I have an AMD3800 MHz double core RAM 2 G
[19:23] <xubuntu056> It's about 3-4 years old
[19:23] <GridCube> thats not the problem, its the mobo whats the problem
[19:24] <GridCube> but it sound fine, you should simply burn an iso to a cd/dvd or use unetbootin to place it on an usb, then plug it in, or place the cd/dvd and reboot
[19:24] <xubuntu056> I have installed ubuntu but is working slowly. In some blogs I have seen xubunto can overcome those problems
[19:25] <GridCube> the installer will guide you then
[19:26] <xubuntu056> the installer form ubuntu you mean?
[19:26] <GridCube> ubiquity yes
[19:26] <GridCube> xubuntu uses the same installer
[19:28] <xubuntu056> I have already created a dvd but there is no automatic installer and when I tried to open the install forlder none of the files seems to work
[19:29] <GridCube> you probably burned it wrong
[19:30] <GridCube> make an usb, its easier
[19:31] <xubuntu056> Just in case I'm going to download it again and try with the disk and the usb, thank you guys
[19:36] <xubuntu749> hey i am new to xubuntu. I just torrented it and cant figure out how to install it on my windows laptop
[19:36] <g16> burn to cd, then reboot with the cd inside.
[19:36] <g16> xubuntu749: ^^^
[19:37] <recon_lap> xubuntu749: you have a blank cd or pen drive
[19:37] <xubuntu749> ill use a flash drive
[19:38] <xubuntu749> how do i burn it to the flash drive
[19:38] <recon_lap> you need to get a USB creator program to put it on the pen drive, I'll have a quick look
[19:39] <xubuntu749> ok thanks
[19:39] <recon_lap> UNetbootin
[19:40] <xubuntu749> so do i download it for windows or linux?
[19:42] <g16> download for windows, you're going to run it on windows.
[19:42] <recon_lap> xubuntu749: your using windows i assumed
[19:42] <xubuntu749> ok, and yes
[19:42] <recon_lap> xubuntu749: http://www.muktware.com/1054/create-ubuntu-liveusb-using-windows
[19:43] <xubuntu749> ok thanks for your help
[19:43] <recon_lap> xubuntu749: just make sure you pick the correct drive :)
[19:48] <xubuntu749> also, will it give me an option to be able to dual boot my computer with either windows 7 or xubuntu?
[19:49] <frustratedtech> yes
[19:50] <recon_lap> xubuntu749: did you backup your important data?
[19:52] <xubuntu749> yes i have all of my stuff on an external hard drive
[19:57] <xubuntu749> I was told to download the 32 bit system even though i have a 64 bit computer (also on xubuntu website  the 32 bit was the best option)
[19:58] <xubuntu749> was i correct in doing that or do i need to download the 64 bit version?
[19:58] <frustratedtech> it wont matter, but if you have a 64bit system then its typically better to get the 64bit version.
[19:59] <frustratedtech> but with your specs, 32bit will be fine
[20:00] <xubuntu749> ok unetbootin is telling me to reboot now...so wish me luck. and thanks for the help
[20:00] <frustratedtech> thumbs up
[20:05] <Cosmoe> 'ello
[20:06] <xubuntu862> I just used unetbootin with a flash drive to download xubuntu onto my windows laptop. after i finished the setup on unetbootin, it asked me to reboot. so i rebooted my computer. what am i supposed to do next
[20:06] <Cosmoe> I'm having an absolute nightmare getting my mouse configured the way I want it, before I go delving too deeply into scripts and config files, are there any decent tools for configuring multiple mouse buttons and mouse sensitivity values?
[20:06] <frustratedtech> put the usb drive in the machine you want to install on and boot from the flash drive
[20:07] <frustratedtech> if it doesnt boot from the flashdrive then you'll need to change your bios settings
[20:07] <recon_lap> xubuntu862: boot from the Live USB and try out a live session to see if there are any issues, if all looks good then runthe installer
[20:10] <butschi> A basic adjustment of mouse and touchpad funktions is included in the settings manager, mouse and touchpad
[20:10] <xubuntu008> I just used unetbootin with a flash drive to download xubuntu onto my windows laptop. after i finished the setup on unetbootin, it asked me to reboot. so i rebooted my computer. what am i supposed to do next
[20:10] <Cosmoe> if anyone just knows a good way to specify the right settings in xorg.conf I'd also be grateful
[20:11] <frustratedtech> Cosmoe, what settings exactly?
[20:11] <KeyboardNotFound> Hi, I have xubuntu 12.10, joined added monitor into the VGA port on my laptop, but I see the same monitor I see the laptop, how do I monitor to see one workspace and the other monitor (laptop) other workspace?
[20:11] <KeyboardNotFound> the command in terminal is: xrandr but i don't know how to setup
[20:11] <Cosmoe> basically, I'm on a laptop and also use an external mouse, I'm looking have different sensitivity/acceleration settings for both, but I also need to bind the side buttons on my external mouse to back and forward, along with upping the amount of lines that the wheel scrolls
[20:12] <Cosmoe> my current solution to getting the sens/accel different is to simply run xset m 0 0 or xset m 5 10 based on whether I'm using the mouse or touchpad
[20:12] <Cosmoe> but this seems a bit clumsy
[20:15] <frustratedtech> sens and accel should be accessible in normal settings manager
[20:15] <frustratedtech> adding the additional buttons would have to be done through txt editor or the use of a binding program
[20:16] <Cosmoe> another problem is that I can't get the sensitivity low enough for the external mouse
[20:16] <frustratedtech> KeyboardNotFound, if your laptop just showing one monitor currently? or do both work but its mirrored?
[20:16] <Cosmoe> even at the lowest, it's still too high
[20:16] <Cosmoe> also, for some reason, according to xinput, Mouseemu hijacks the external mouse
[20:17] <KeyboardNotFound> frustratedtech, at the moment only laptop monitor :)
[20:17] <KeyboardNotFound> i like to use the external monitor but to view workspace 2
[20:17] <frustratedtech> Cosmoe, try this https://launchpad.net/btnx
[20:20] <Cosmoe> thank you, I will have a look
[20:24] <Cosmoe> huh
[20:24] <Cosmoe> unfortunately btnx just segfaults on this machine
[20:25] <Cosmoe> any other alternatives?
[20:27] <Cosmoe> no, sorry, do excuse me, it needs root
[20:27] <Cosmoe> I see it fails gracefully
[20:30] <Kjubert> I have a question: is the Ubuntu-Software-Center generally downloading .deb-files for installing software? Because for some software you cant find deb-packages for download online and i would like to gather these by copying possible temporary deb-packages the software-center is using. is there a way??
[20:35] <Cosmoe> that's another problem frustratedtech , the settings in the xfce mouse settings in the settings manager seem to randomly change
[20:38] <frustratedtech> i have not had to adjust mine.  but im sure there is a program that would handle it better.  even gnomes is better, maybe you can install theirs?
[20:38] <Cosmoe> I could do
[20:42] <Cosmoe> I find it remarkable that it's 2013 and this is still so difficult
[20:49] <jcg2> Is there aa method to re-install just the xubuntu system on a boot drive if it is hosed.  Windows has such a capability but I cannot find anything to indicate Xubuntu does this?
[20:52] <kgb> not really, no
[20:53] <kgb> it's a bit different 2 do that
[20:53] <kgb> depends on how it's broken..
