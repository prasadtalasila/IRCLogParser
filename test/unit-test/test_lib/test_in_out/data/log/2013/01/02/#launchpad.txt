[02:39] <micahg> does anyone know why bug counts were removed from the +uploaded-packages and like pages?
[02:42] <lifeless> StevenK: or wgrant: may
[02:48] <wgrant> micahg: Because it was very expensive to calculate, and pretty much unused.
[02:48] <wgrant> We removed it a few months back, and this is the first mention of its absence :)
[02:48] <micahg> I've been meaning to say something for a while now :), it helped me watch for regressions with uploads
[02:49] <micahg> I guess I could probably write something that could warn me even better :)
[02:49] <wgrant> Yeah, but then someone uploads linux and xorg-server and a few drivers, and we end up counting 50000 bugs.
[02:49] <micahg> what if it was opt in?
[02:50] <wgrant> I thought the usual practice was to subscribe to the package for a few weeks
[02:50] <wgrant> Then that would be an opt-in timeout :)
[02:50] <wgrant> So no
[02:50] <micahg> yeah, but subscribe to random packages where I don't want to see most bugs isn't so useful
[02:50] <wgrant> How does the count help you to identify regressions?
[02:51] <wgrant> Unless the package has no bugs open normally at all
[02:51] <micahg> most don't :)
[02:51] <micahg> or the number is very low
[02:55] <micahg> I'm hoping I can access the uploader information both direct and sponsored through the API?
[03:00] <StevenK> Ummmmm. I *think* so
[03:00] <StevenK> It probably ends up on the source publication
[03:01] <wgrant> I don't think it's easily searchable at present, but an API would be fairly easy to add
[03:31] <micahg> ok, well, I'll probably be asking questions at some point
[03:49] <micahg> webops: meissa seems to be having chroot issues lately, does it need a cleaning?
[03:52] <wgrant> I've manualled it
[03:52] <wgrant> It does not seem very happy at all
[03:53] <wgrant> webops: before removing the problematic file from the cache, can you grab its size?
[03:57]  * micahg will retry the chroot failed distro builds

[11:21] <czajkowski> gatox: shoot
[11:22] <gatox> czajkowski, awesome! thx..... i have a branch in launchpad that is importing code from git, the git repo had been updated yesterday, but the launchpad branch is not being updated, and now i can't find the "import now" button that it used to be there
[11:22] <gatox> i'm kind of lost..... but i'm kind of rusty with this too
[11:23] <czajkowski> gatox: you importing it to your ppa or a project
[11:23] <czajkowski> looking for the LP urL
[11:24] <gatox> czajkowski, i'm talking about this branch: https://code.launchpad.net/~saruneko/umedia/master
[11:24] <wgrant> gatox: Fixed
[11:24] <gatox> it says import started at.... but is not taking the latest changes from git.....
[11:24] <wgrant> Should reimport in a few minutes
[11:25] <wgrant> There's no "Import Now" button because there's already one scheduled
[11:25] <czajkowski> wgrant: what did you do to fix it
[11:25] <gatox> wgrant, yes..... it reimport several since last night...... but it never take the latest changes from github..... that's the problem
[11:26] <wgrant> It's bug #1072461

[14:14] <gotwig> why does it *hang*?
[14:14] <gotwig> infinite loop?
[14:54] <hggdh> I have a project on LP that I mistakenly set as private on creation. I have since changed it all to public, and checked the licences to be GPL3. Still, I got an email from LP saying it is a commercial subscription
[14:55] <hggdh> any ideas on what to do?
[14:56] <czajkowski> seeming similar with another project
[14:56] <czajkowski> have just mentioned this to sinzui
[14:57] <czajkowski> hggdh: what is the project ?
[14:58] <hggdh> czajkowski: https://launchpad.net/ue-qa-kernel-tests-infrastructure
[14:58] <sinzui> hggdh, ignore the email. If the project's license is not proprietary the project will continue to stay active. If you are using commercial features, they will be deactivated when the commercial subscription expires
[14:59] <czajkowski> https://launchpad.net/ue-qa-kernel-tests-infrastructure/+sharing
[14:59] <sinzui> hggdh, you may want the commercial subscription if the project needs proprietary blueprints, bugs, or branches.
[15:00] <hggdh> sinzui: no, it does not need it; if it does, anyway, it will be under Canonical (but, again, I see no need)
[15:00] <sinzui> okay
[15:01] <hggdh> czajkowski: I saw the sharing, but worried about deleting it and having my own access vanish
[15:02] <sinzui> hggdh, you access should be through the team. I just removed you
[15:03] <hggdh> sinzui: thank you

[23:29] <evillyEvil> How do I fix this error? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1490189/
[23:29] <evillyEvil> I was able to branch from launchpad just yesterday
[23:35] <wgrant> evillyEvil: It sounds like your local SSH keys are misconfigured
[23:35] <evillyEvil> wgrant: No, I don't think taht is possible. Just yesterday, I was able to branch from launchpad
[23:36] <wgrant> What does 'ssh YOURLPUSERNAME@bazaar.launchpad.net' say?
[23:39] <evillyEvil> wgrant: it said "permission denied"
[23:40] <wgrant> If you run it with -v, do you see it offering your SSH key?
[23:41] <evillyEvil> Erm, it prints "debug1: Trying .../" ?
[23:41] <wgrant> eg. mine says
[23:41] <wgrant> debug1: Offering RSA public key: /home/wgrant/.ssh/id_rsa
[23:42] <evillyEvil> Then no, I don't see any line with "offering"
[23:42] <evillyEvil> (This is on Windows, btw)
[23:42] <evillyEvil> (And yes, I did run pageant to host the key)
[23:43] <evillyEvil> (is running, that is)
[23:43] <wgrant> Ah
[23:43] <wgrant> Well, there's no problem on the Launchpad end, and I don't know pageant well. But it looks like your client is misconfigured somehow
[23:44] <evillyEvil> Would you suggest re-install bzr?
[23:44] <wgrant> No
[23:45] <evillyEvil> Well, then what should I check?
[23:45] <evillyEvil> I don't understand how I was I able to branch from launchpad just yesterday, and now I can't
[23:45] <evillyEvil> Didn't change anything
[23:45] <evillyEvil> same key, same acocunt
[23:47] <wgrant> evillyEvil: What's your Launchpad username?
[23:48] <evillyEvil> wgrant: I sent you the username
[23:50] <wgrant> 2013-01-02 23:39:30+0000 [SSHService ssh-userauth on KeepAliveSettingSSHServerTransport (TimeoutProtocol)] <yourusername> trying auth none
[23:50] <wgrant> Your client is indeed not sending any keys
[23:50] <evillyEvil> by client, you meant the bazaar application?
[23:51] <wgrant> ssh/pageant, probably.
[23:51] <evillyEvil> Oh, hmmm
[23:51] <evillyEvil> How is that possible? The thing was working yesterday just fine...
[23:52] <wgrant> Windows' SSH client stack is a little non-traditional, so I can't really help there
[23:53] <evillyEvil> wgrant: Ok, I see. But do you have any suggestion on what else I should check?
[23:54] <wgrant> Check that pageant is running, that it has your keys, that ssh is able to connect to it
[23:54] <wgrant> Perhaps the ssh -v output has something useful in it
[23:54] <evillyEvil> wgrant: Well, the output ends with "No more authentication to try ...."
[23:55] <wgrant> Right, but we're interested in what happens *before* it gives up
[23:55] <wgrant> Like, why isn't it trying to use a key
[23:55] <evillyEvil> Also, the debug1 lines contain UNIX-like paths, which look wrong because this is a Windows Environemnt
[23:55] <wgrant> That's probably normal
[23:56] <evillyEvil> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1490235/
[23:56] <evillyEvil> wgrant: That's the output of the command
[23:56] <evillyEvil> I honestly can't find anything helpful there
[23:57] <TheLordOfTime> Permission denied (publickey). <-- did you upload a SSH pubkey to launchpad?
[23:57] <TheLordOfTime> and is the corresponding private key on your system
[23:57] <TheLordOfTime> (and readable by ssh)
[23:57] <wgrant> evillyEvil: It doesn't seem to be trying pageant, but I don't know how ssh/pageant integration works.
[23:58] <wgrant> It's been a very long time since I used it
[23:58] <TheLordOfTime> oop sorry didn't know wgrant was helping
[23:58]  * TheLordOfTime returns to silence
[23:58] <evillyEvil> TheLordOfTime: Yes, I am certain that I have uploaded the public key. Because I was able to branch from launchpad just yesterday.
[23:59] <evillyEvil> wgrant: Yeah, I'm not an expert either!
