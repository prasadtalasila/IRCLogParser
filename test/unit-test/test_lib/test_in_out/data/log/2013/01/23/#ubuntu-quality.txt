[00:12] <cprofitt> anyone here know how to figure out why my printer will not add under 13.04?
[00:14] <cprofitt> It detects ok, but then I get a message 'Failed to add new printer' and no more information.
[00:17] <balloons> cprofitt, :-(
[00:18] <cprofitt> think I found the applicable bug
[00:18] <cprofitt> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-control-center/+bug/1101213
[00:18] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1101213 in gnome-control-center (Ubuntu) "G-c-c printing doesn't allow you to select a hp printer" [Undecided,New]
[00:18] <cprofitt> yep, that one worked for me
[00:20] <cprofitt> that one would be a bad one to get to release
[00:21] <balloons> weird
[00:21] <balloons> I have an hp that works
[00:21] <cprofitt> my HP worked, just not throught the exposed GUI
[00:22] <balloons> ohh
[00:22] <balloons> lol..
[00:22] <balloons> it's plugged into my wife's machine
[00:22] <balloons> even though it sits next to mine
[00:22] <balloons> hahah
[00:23] <cprofitt> so system-config-printer worked, but the gnome control center did not
[05:30] <pitti> Good morning
[06:05] <balloons> guten morgen pitti
[06:06] <balloons> wie geht?
[06:07] <pitti> hey balloons! gut, danke! und Dir?
[06:08] <balloons> gut.. mon hands? es kalt :-)
[06:09] <pitti> haha
[06:09] <balloons> ;-) my german is 4 days worth of exposure from before last UDS ;-)
[06:10] <balloons> I love the way german sounds.. it has such a soothing cadence to it
[06:24] <pitti> balloons: FYI, it's "Meine Hände? Sie sind kalt" (my hands? they are cold)
[06:25] <pitti> balloons: really, soothing? with our rather hard vowels and consonants they chose German to alert and train dogs :)
[06:25] <balloons> ahh. yes, some french slipped in there.. I do know meine ;-) no idea if it was mein or meine Hände :-)
[06:26] <pitti> mein is singular, meine is plural
[06:26] <balloons> pitti, yes, I guess call me crazy.. I think it sounds cool.. It's not a lullaby though :-)
[06:26] <pitti> (or singular feminine)
[06:26] <balloons> ahh, danke
[06:26] <balloons> wow.. meine is plural and singular feminine
[06:27] <balloons> hmmm
[06:27] <balloons> guten nacht pitti.. it's time for me
[06:28] <pitti> sleep well!

[07:20] <Noskcaj> balloons, what's happened to the classroom sessions in my absence? i'm confused
[07:20]  * balloons pretends he's asleep
[07:20] <balloons> Noskcaj, i thought you all switched the times
[07:20] <balloons> perhaps phillw did
[07:21] <Noskcaj> yeah, something like that. i was away from the internet for 3 days
[07:22] <balloons> gotcha
[07:59] <zyga> good morning

[14:52] <phillw> hi smartboyhw
[14:52] <smartboyhw> phillw, now I will set my session on 6th Feb, 2012
[14:52] <smartboyhw> Oops 2013:P
[14:54] <phillw> smartboyhw: good :) Noskaj popped on earlier, at least he now knows our sessions are not today :)
[15:01] <smartboyhw> phillw, LOL
[15:06] <smartboyhw> phillw, balloons PING (respond now)
[15:08] <smartboyhw> gema also
[15:09] <smartboyhw> phillw, balloons gema I just realized that 30th January 2013 is when Ubuntu Developer Week will be held.
[15:09] <smartboyhw> No way we are gonna get into their way
[15:09] <smartboyhw> Guess we need to delay it till certain time
[15:25] <gema> smartboyhw:
[15:25] <gema> pong
[15:25] <gema> smartboyhw, phillw I don't mind delaying it another week
[16:06] <balloons> yes, I'm not sure who moved the sessions to next weds
[16:06] <balloons> phillw, do you know?
[16:07] <balloons> since udw is going on at the same time, we should probably pick a different day

[17:21] <balloons> hey zyga
[17:21] <zyga> balloons: any update on friendly topics? I wasn't able to track things today
[17:21] <balloons> zyga, not yet
[17:21] <balloons> most folks aren't about yet
[17:22] <zyga> ping me if something shows up, I'll start posting parts of the friendly prototype for review

[17:34] <antarus> Is the UI for Utah just jenkins, or is there a separate UI?
[17:50] <balloons> antarus, there is no UI persay for utah..you define a job, and the output is written to a file.. jenkins is used as a nice way to view the output and execute the jobs.. you could utilize something else if you wished
[17:51] <antarus> is this junit XML output then?
[17:56] <balloons> antarus, josepht could tell you more
[17:57] <balloons> if he's about :-)
[17:58] <balloons> what are you looking to do
[17:58] <balloons> ?
[18:01] <antarus> mostly curious
[18:01] <antarus> we currently use autotest for our QA / testing efforts
[18:01] <antarus> and I think we have a..healthy dislike of it
[18:22] <balloons> ahh..
[18:22] <balloons> well, utah has a mailing list.. you could certainly get your questions answered by asking on there as well
[18:23] <balloons> antarus, https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/Ubuntu-utah-devel
[18:24] <antarus> ok, thanks ;)
[19:40] <xnox> antarus: i think it's yaml.
[19:40] <xnox> antarus: not junit xml.
[19:40] <josepht> antarus: xnox is correct
[19:47] <zyga> antarus: heh
[19:47] <zyga> antarus: there's a milion tools for automatic testing out there
[19:48] <zyga> antarus: I believe that plars has experience with autotest

[21:45] <dkessel> good evening!
[21:51] <balloons> hey dkessel
[21:51] <balloons> how does tonight find you?
[21:52] <dkessel> it finds me... positively tired :)
[21:52]  * dkessel has had his first diving lesson today
[21:53] <balloons> ohh.. fun! but tiring
[21:53] <balloons> I've been there.. I hope it's a good tired ;-)
[21:55] <dkessel> yup :) prost!
[21:55] <balloons> thomi, you about mate?
[21:55] <Noskcaj> dkessel, i assume you didn't do a handbrake turn in your first lesson. i had to.
[21:55] <thomi> balloons: yup, sure am
[21:55] <thomi> what's up?
[21:55] <dkessel> handbrake turn?
[21:56] <dkessel> *looks that up*
[21:56] <Noskcaj> dkessel, drift?
[21:56] <Noskcaj> go sideways while turning
[21:57] <Noskcaj> do any of you guys know about ssd suport in ubuntu?
[21:57] <dkessel> ah.... no, none of that today. diving in a circle at 3 m depth in the pool was the maximum :)
[21:59] <Noskcaj> ok
[22:02] <balloons> Noskcaj, a little
[22:03] <balloons> hello SergioMeneses :-
[22:04] <SergioMeneses> balloons, hey hey!
[22:04] <Noskcaj> balloons, other than the stuff listed here http://www.howtogeek.com/62761/how-to-tweak-your-ssd-in-ubuntu-for-better-performance/ do you have any suggestions?
[22:05] <SergioMeneses> I have email from Carla! o0
[22:05] <alesage> balloons, did you get a hangout invite?
[22:05] <balloons> I did not
[22:11] <dkessel> hmm. i should probably enable trimming
[22:12] <Noskcaj> dkessel, good idea, and move all your  temp files
[22:14] <dkessel> mhh i don't know... wouldn't that use up my memory too much? i only have SSDs on my netbooks with little RAM...
[22:16] <dkessel> who is the guy on the "ubuntu might become a rolling release after 14.04" g+ hangout? http://www.heise.de/open/meldung/Ubuntu-Canonical-erwaegt-Umstellung-auf-Rolling-Release-1789862.html
[22:17] <dkessel> should be someone from canonical, probably?
[22:19] <Noskcaj> dkessel, i was assuming you have a second drive. i have a 1TB caviar black as well as my new agility 3
[22:20] <Noskcaj> rolling release, that sounds interesting. but isn't ubuntu partly rolling anyway?
[22:22] <dkessel> well the development version is :)
[22:23] <dkessel> uds-s
[22:23] <dkessel> oops
[22:23] <phillw> dkessel: I prefer to wait for announcements at UDS... there is that much 'chatter' about what ubuntu is and is not going to do keeps the 'new news' people in updated blogs :D
[22:25] <dkessel> phillw, speaking of UDS, the web site does not say yet when or where the next one will be. around what time is that announced normally?
[22:28] <phillw> dkessel: It's not been announced yet... No doubt there will be many "breaking stories"... but stay tuned to http://uds.ubuntu.com/ for the facts :)
[22:29] <dkessel> phillw: http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-s/ says "oakland, california" ;)
[22:30] <phillw> dkessel: I was going to say, I expect USA for UDS-S :D
[22:30] <phillw> may be you can raise a bug report :P
[22:31] <dkessel> phillw: too bad, I would've loved to attend a UDS once :) if that would even be possible...yeah... i'd file a bug "UDS-S will not be in europe"
[22:32] <phillw> dkessel: they are in EU about 1 / 3 times, so it should be back in EU about 14.10
=== Noskcaj is now known as Noskcaj_afk
[22:35] <dkessel> ...that leaves some time for me to make sure i get the possibility to attend ;)
[22:35] <stgraber> phillw: it's more like 1/2 actually, we only had one exception ever where it happened twice in a row in the US
[22:39] <stgraber> (for those I attended, it's been: Boston, Prague, Mountain-View, Barcelona, Dallas, Brussels, Orlando, Budapest, Orlando, *Oakland, Copenhagen)
[22:41] <phillw> stgraber: I sit corrected :)
[22:41] <stgraber> my memory is a bit fuzzy for those before that as I was only attending remotely, but I think it was: Montreal, Paris and Mountain-View
[22:41] <balloons> :-)
[22:41] <balloons> dkessel, we do sponsor folks
[22:41] <balloons> but yea, you just missed the copenhagen one
[22:41] <stgraber> I can't remember what was before Montreal though, might have been Sidney
[22:41] <balloons> probably close to you
[22:41] <balloons> btw, that guy in the hangout video is daniel holbach
[22:41] <phillw> One day, they will hold one in London where the UK Canonical office is :)
[22:41] <balloons> great chap
[22:42] <balloons> he does ubuntu developer stuff, but dips into qa to help out on the autopkg test
[22:42] <dkessel> yeah, copenhagen would have been possible :) ah, that is daniel :) yeah, we had email contact - and some here during the autopkgtest hackfest
[22:42] <balloons> ohh btw.. thomi just shared some good news dkessel
[22:42] <stgraber> phillw: extremely unlikely, the first few Ubuntu meetings back in 2004/2005 were in the UK but they've moved to cheaper locations since
[22:42] <balloons> /usr/share/doc/python-autopilot/html/index.html has the autopilot docs.. the website is missing them because of a build error
[22:42] <balloons> until it gets corrected, have a look there
[22:42] <stgraber> it's even getting rare to get internal company sprints in London as flying people abroad is cheaper apparently :)
[22:43] <phillw> stgraber: yeah, they should try manchester :)
[22:43] <balloons> I was wondering where they all went
[22:43] <dkessel> balloons, oh nice - thanks for the hint
[22:43] <balloons> yea.. I'm seriously floored
[22:44] <dkessel> ... and good job! to thomi :)
[22:44] <balloons> yes, uk oddly enough is more expensive..
[22:44] <thomi> :)
[22:44] <balloons> sadly the others aren't about.. i'll mail everyone
[22:46] <phillw> balloons: from a read back of logs, were you chatting to the lap-top testing team?
[22:46] <balloons> at some point
[22:46] <balloons> lol

=== toddyhb is now known as toddy
[22:49] <SergioMeneses> and what happened?
[22:49] <balloons> SergioMeneses, carla is going to contact you
[22:49] <dkessel> thomi, which autopilot version should the docs say in the bottom left corner? 0.1 or 1.1?
[22:50] <balloons> your going to be part of the session
[22:50] <thomi> dkessel: let me check, one sec
[22:50] <SergioMeneses> balloons, sure, Im answering her email back
[22:50] <phillw> SergioMeneses: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Activities/Classroom#Section_4
[22:51] <SergioMeneses> phillw, we are working on that
[22:51] <SergioMeneses> :)
[22:51] <SergioMeneses> we shall met tomorrow
[22:52] <phillw> SergioMeneses: that is great news. Whilst I'm not the the admin for the sessions, it seems to have been a bit of mission creep for me :D
[22:52] <thomi> dkessel: there's a small bug in the docs - it's not reading the version number from the package.... Should be easy enough to fix though.
[22:52] <thomi> dkesselhowever, the docs in /usr/share/doc/python-autopilot/ are generated for each build, so they're *guaranteed* to be relevant for the version of autopilot that you have insstalled
[22:53] <balloons> phillw, haha!
[22:53] <SergioMeneses> phillw, jajaja a bit!
[22:55] <dkessel> thomi, sorry to say that - but what about the API docs? ;)
[23:01] <dkessel> ah well. good night. i should really be in bed already
