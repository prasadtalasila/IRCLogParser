[07:50] <bkerensa> jcastro: hmm I will have to reach out and get some they look nice
[07:50] <bkerensa> jcastro: I am still waiting for a 60W-equiv that uses only 8-10w in A19 Form
[07:53] <dholbach> good morning
[07:54] <JoseeAntonioR> hey, dholbach! how's life?
[07:54] <dholbach> good good - how's yours? :)
[07:54] <JoseeAntonioR> great :)
[07:54] <dholbach> we still have to find somebody for the thursday slot
[07:54] <JoseeAntonioR> I was just wondering about that one
[07:54] <dholbach> yep, I'll go around and ping a few people in a bit
[07:57] <JoseeAntonioR> ok, so the calendar's ready, that's the only one that needs to be changed
[07:57] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: I listed you as a helper in all but on-air sessions, is that fine?
[07:58] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, sure, still it might be good to have a few people as fallback, so if I can't make it there's still somebody else
[07:59] <JoseeAntonioR> I can be there if needed, just let me know so I can wake up earlier
[08:02] <dholbach> great
[08:05] <JoseeAntonioR> is there anything else I may give you a hand with?
[08:08] <dholbach> no, I think we should be all set - we could try to get something up on the forums about it
[08:09] <JoseeAntonioR> maybe I can cross-post the ubuntuclassroom blog post, as forums don't allow much formatting
[08:09] <dholbach> ah ok
[08:21] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12473079
[08:22] <dholbach> wow
[08:22] <dholbach> that was quick!
[08:22] <JoseeAntonioR> could only use 8 images, so I deleted the last two (which were enormous btw)
[08:22]  * dholbach hugs JoseeAntonioR
[08:22]  * JoseeAntonioR hugs dholbach back
[08:22] <dholbach> really? I thought I had scaled them al down
[08:23] <JoseeAntonioR> you did in the html code, but the forums don't accept html, so they look gigantic
[08:24] <dholbach> ah
[08:24] <dholbach> ok :-)
[08:28] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: would you like me to get the post as a general community announcement so it appears in the top of all pages until monday?
[08:28] <JoseeAntonioR> (for the forums)
[08:29] <dholbach> wow
[08:29] <dholbach> that's possible?
[08:29] <dholbach> if so, yes :-D
[08:30] <JoseeAntonioR> ok, I'll try with the admins
[08:30] <dholbach> I thought you could just sticky in subforums
[08:30] <dholbach> sweeeeeeeeet
[08:30] <dholbach> propaganda machinery: rolling :)
[08:30] <JoseeAntonioR> if you get one of the admins to post it in a closed subforum, it appears in the top of all pages
[08:30] <dholbach> great
[08:33] <elfy> dholbach: ping
[08:33] <JoseeAntonioR> there we go, the guy who made it sticky
[08:34] <elfy> dholbach: I'll try and sort the announcement out later today - just of out into the wild, in future if you could drop us a line a bit in advance we don't need to try and rush things :)
[08:34] <elfy> I tend to see the cafe threads as they pop up and stick them as I see them
[08:39] <elfy> dholbach: can you PM me what you want the announcement to say - not too long please and I'll try to do it before I go out, or when I get back
[08:45] <JoseeAntonioR> I'm out to sleep for a bit, see you guys later!
[08:47] <dholbach> elfy, would something along the lines of https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2013-January/001008.html be OK? or maybe just the first or first two paragraphs?
[08:50] <elfy> dholbach - I'll see what we can do - might be better as a notice rather than announcement, will look when I get back - just off out now
[08:53] <dholbach> thank youuuuu!
[09:02] <elfy> dholbach: done the announcement - will look later - I think it'll be better as a notice, but it's there for the moment
[09:05]  * dholbach hugs elfy
[09:06] <elfy> man hug I hope lol
[09:06] <elfy> and now I got to go :)

[11:50] <elfy> dholbach: we had a chat about announcement vs notice - notices look horrid, we try to use them only for things like "Forum is going down for a long awaited upgrade" :p
[11:50] <elfy> as it is - the announcement is getting views
[11:50] <elfy> as is the sticky
[11:53] <nigelb> hey elfy

[15:47] <s-fox> dholbach,  ping re: rescheduling FC & CC meeting :)
[15:47] <dholbach> s-fox, ah, yes
[15:47] <dholbach> what about it?
[15:48] <dholbach> it looked like a few could make it, no?
[15:48] <s-fox> we've all replied and heard nothing back, i wasn't sure what time you wish to aim for dholbach
[15:48] <dholbach> it sounded like some could make it to the time which was proposed originally, no?
[15:48] <dholbach> that sounded good enough to me
[15:49] <s-fox> 3 can make that time. i can do that also, but will be ~30 minutes late (i am not sure how long the meeting will be dholbach )
[15:49] <dholbach> that's fine - usually we fit the meeting into an hour
[15:49] <dholbach> and if 3 can make it we should get a good idea of how the cycle has been working for the FC :)
[15:50] <s-fox> do you  have an agenda?
[15:50] <dholbach> it's a catch-up
[15:50] <s-fox> okay.
[15:50] <dholbach> we just want to get an idea of how everything's working out, etc
[15:50] <jcastro> hey mhall119
[15:50] <dholbach> we invited other councils and boards to the CC meeting too: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncilAgenda
[15:51] <jcastro> can you put this in your idea brain when you chat with the lens ninjas: packaging lenses
[15:51] <jcastro> not for packaging ubuntu packages, but like, tracking UPS/FedEx, etc.
[15:51] <czajkowski> s-fox: it's the same as before
[15:51] <czajkowski> the FC has been on previous cycles for a check up and a catch up
[15:57] <jono> dholbach, mhall119, jcastro, balloons, dpm I am going to be a few mins late, can one of you start the hangout and invite me and I will join?
[15:57] <dholbach> can somebody else please start it? my video stopped working (can't see any videos at all) in hangouts
[15:57] <jcastro> yep
[15:57] <jcastro> one sec
[15:58] <s-fox> okay dholbach . we were concerned you had something specific you wished to discuss. see you there.
[15:58] <dpm> jono, ok!
[15:58] <dholbach> s-fox, no, it should be all nice and easy :)
[15:59] <czajkowski> s-fox: no just nobody turned up to the last one
[15:59] <czajkowski> so we reschudled it again

[17:25] <jono> jcastro, sure
