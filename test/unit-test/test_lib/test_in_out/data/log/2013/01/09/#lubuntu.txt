[20:37] <Guest26872> running ./autogen.sh  to install jhbuild gives error
[20:38] <Guest26872> gnome-autogen.sh not available
[20:38] <Guest26872> yelp-tools not available
[20:38] <Guest26872> Configuring jhbuild without autotools
[20:38] <Guest26872> how to install these package??
[20:39] <Unit193> ...Why don't you just install jhbuild from the repos rather than compiling from source?
[20:39] <Unit193> !info jhbuild
[20:39] <ubottu> jhbuild (source: jhbuild): flexible build script for package collections. In component universe, is optional. Version 3.5.91-1 (quantal), package size 686 kB, installed size 2857 kB
[20:50] <Guest32825> i have to use jhbuild to edit & compile gnome s/w,,don't want to interfere with system files.that's why want to build from source  as non-root user in separate file..
[20:50] <Guest32825> suggest how to build it..
[21:00] <Unit193> Guest32825: sudo apt-get build-dep jhbuild
[21:00] <Unit193> !source
[21:00] <ubottu> You can easily fetch a package's source with apt-get. See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
[21:06] <Guest32825> i don't want to  pollute the rest of your system,,this will install jhbuild as a root user..
[21:06] <Guest32825> your>my
[21:06] <Unit193> That actually just installs the depends needed to build jhbuild.
[21:07] <Unit193> You could run it with -s to simulate.
[21:09] <Guest32825> i want to install jhbuild in  ~/checkout/gnome as a non-root.
[21:09] <Osmodivs> Hello. When I try to configure the look and feel of Lubuntu 12.04 64bit, I get this error message, the black window appears when I start a session: http://www.pasteall.org/pic/43299
[21:10] <TheLordOfTime> Guest32825, erm, aren't you already being helped in #ubuntu on this?
[21:10] <Guest32825> no
[21:10] <Noskcaj> Osmodivs, i know a lot of themes can't work if the bottom bat is visible, set it to 100% transparency fixes that. i will look at your problem now
[21:10] <Noskcaj> *bar
[21:11] <Unit193> Osmodivs: If you read the error, something is up with your ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml
[21:11] <Unit193> Osmodivs: Can you head .config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml | pastebinit  ?
[21:13] <Osmodivs> Unit193: What progam can read this .xml file? All I get is: This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below. In a browser
[21:14] <Osmodivs> Unit193: Leafpad does not open that kinnda file either
[21:14] <Unit193> The command I gave will paste the head, but it seems something may have messed with the file.  First thing I'd say would be to check permissions, you could always reset it to default too.
[21:17] <Osmodivs> Unit193: I can't reset Openbox, because when I try to open it, it will give me the error message
[21:19] <Unit193> You could backup your current version, then copy from /etc/xdg/openbox/rc.xml or /usr/share/lubuntu/openbox/rc.xml
[21:24] <Osmodivs> Unit193: Ok, you want me to copy the rc.xml file to /.config/openbox/
[21:24] <Osmodivs> I thought lubuntu-rc.xml was the problem...
[21:25] <Unit193> Overwrite lubuntu-rc.xml after you backup lubuntu-rc.xml.
