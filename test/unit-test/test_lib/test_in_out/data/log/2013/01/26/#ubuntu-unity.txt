[19:12] <eff_> hi, excuse me i've been searching for quite a while and can't seem to find an answer on google, how can i make unity display the running applications name/title inside the taskbar instead (or near by) the application icon ?
[21:01] <krnekhelesh> eff_ that cannot be done unless you want to modify the source code yourself
[21:02] <eff_> it wouldnt be that much of doing the modification, than setting up the compillation environment for it :/
[21:02] <eff_> ok, thanks you anyway :)
