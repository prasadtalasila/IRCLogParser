[15:13] <Chipaca> ouch, my grammar is hurting right now
[15:13] <Chipaca> “power users can change the location of their home directory to another drive (which, if you were actually keeping all your personal data there, you've already have done), so that particular point is moot.”
[15:13] <Chipaca> anybody able to give me a hand lining up those verbs?
[15:13] <Chipaca> my head is not cooperating :(
[15:13] <Chipaca> (specifically, the ones inside the parens)
[15:14] <beuno> Chipaca, I think he means something like mounting /home from a different drive than
[15:14] <Chipaca> I wrote it :)
[15:14] <Chipaca> it's a reply to http://askubuntu.com/questions/51362/why-not-sync-folders-outside-home-with-ubuntu-one/51383#comment298810_51383
[15:14] <beuno> ah, all the more fun
[15:14] <Chipaca> and I know those verbs are wrong, but can't find the way to put them right :)
[15:15] <beuno> "which, if you where actually keeping all your personal data in you would want to do anyway"?
[15:15] <Chipaca> I'll change the "have" to "are"
[15:16] <Chipaca> I mean the "were" to "are"
[15:16] <Chipaca> which, if you are actually keeping all your personal data there, you've already done
[15:16] <Chipaca> good enough
[15:16] <Chipaca> beuno: no, you're changing the meaning :)

[19:22] <alo21> hi everybody..
[19:23] <alo21> I live in Italy, and I would like to by an album...
[19:24] <alo21> this album is not available in Ubuntu One Music Store, but it is available on 7digital italian website. Why?
[19:24] <chaselivingston> alo21: that's an issue we're aware of, and our developers are working to fix
[19:25] <alo21> chaselivingston, Perfect! Thank you
[19:25] <dobey> chaselivingston: i don't think that's entirely correct?
[19:25] <chaselivingston> dobey: i think that's because they catalog is out of sync, trying to correct that now
[19:26] <alo21> chaselivingston, How much time does it take about?
[19:26] <chaselivingston> alo21: not sure, to be honest
[19:26] <dobey> chaselivingston: i think it's because we don't have an italian store, and italy gets the EU store
[19:27] <chaselivingston> dobey: could be
[19:27] <dobey> alo21: do you have an example album we can check?
[19:28] <alo21> dobey, sure... the artist is Foals
[19:28] <alo21> the album is: total life forever
[19:28] <chaselivingston> alo21: https://one.ubuntu.com/music-store/release/856319/foals/total-life-forever
[19:29] <dobey> chaselivingston: that album is not available on the EU store
[19:29] <alo21> dobey, exactly... in fact I got: page not found
[19:29] <chaselivingston> interesting…. you got page not found on my link as well alo21?
[19:30] <dobey> chaselivingston: you see it because it's on the US store
[19:30] <dobey> chaselivingston: but it's not on eu.7digital.com for example, while it is on it.7digital.com
[19:30] <dobey> so this is a regional availability issue
[19:31] <chaselivingston> dobey: ok, i'll raise this issue with 7digital to see if there's anything they can do about it
[19:32] <alo21> I really hope this bug will be fix shortly
[19:32] <davmor2> https://one.ubuntu.com/music-store-up/release/815219/foals/total-life-forever
[19:32] <davmor2> how about that one instead
[19:32] <alo21> davmor2, doesn't work
[19:33] <davmor2> alo21: I'm in the uk that one is working for me
[19:33] <dobey> davmor2: no, it's a regional issue. it's on the gb store :)
[19:34] <davmor2> dobey: that's what I was checking being as it was different to the US store, I know there is EU too which is really restrictive by all accounts
[19:34] <alo21> dobey, also... there is another issue. I can see some songs on the website only and other both (music player and web)
[19:34] <dobey> yes, though there are some Foals albums on the eu store
[19:34] <alo21> I have to go
[19:35] <dobey> alo21: the ui in rhythmbox is no more; it will be going away completely soon
[19:35] <dobey> oh well
