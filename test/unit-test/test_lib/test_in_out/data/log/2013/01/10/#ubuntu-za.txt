[06:27] <superfly> by the way... http://sixpacktech.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/comic-15.jpeg 
[06:28] <Kilos> hahaha

[07:05] <Kilos> hi hubx 
[07:09] <Kilos> hi theblazehen 
[07:18] <theblazehen> hi kilos
[07:24] <Kilos> hi henkj 
[07:24] <henkj> hi kilos
[08:16] <barrydk> Good morning all
[08:22] <Squirm> it's still morning?
[08:22] <Squirm> oh right... it is
[08:36] <Kilos> the plot thickens
[08:37] <inetpro> Kilos: why?
[08:37] <Kilos> pc just strated rebooting and no ups here
[08:37] <Kilos> started
[08:38] <Kilos> so took it for a blow dry and disabled the overclocked bit
[08:38] <Kilos> will see now
[08:39] <Kilos> also ran touch /forcefsck
[08:39] <Kilos> and put old graphics drive back
[08:39] <Kilos> s/drive/card
[08:52] <henkj> kilos sounds like you're changing too much to determine the cause of the problem
[08:55] <Kilos> yeah henkj but im just replacing what i removed when i was trying to find the prob
[08:56] <henkj> I should probably dust mine again
[08:56] <Kilos> compressed air is the best henkj 
[08:56] <Kilos> blow it clean
[08:57] <henkj> think it's been 6 months since it's last appointment with a blower
[08:58] <Kilos> clouds of dust came out of the cpu fan and heatsink and power supply
[08:59] <henkj> it's scary when there is so much dust in the cpu fan/heatsink
[08:59] <Kilos> yip
[09:01] <Kilos> ian has to use this to be able to support clients
[09:01] <Kilos> hes trying it on kubuntu

=== Trix[a]r_za is now known as Trixar_za
[09:11] <WOLFEYES> i am on kde.
[09:12] <Kilos> is it a package WOLFEYES 
[09:13] <WOLFEYES> I don't know what it is, it doesn't have an extension on it
[09:14] <Kilos> how do you know its for linux
[09:15] <Kilos> oh it shows VMware-Player-5.0.1-894247.i386.bundle
[09:16] <Kilos> would be better to have been .deb
[09:16] <Kilos> inetpro, ideas?
[09:20] <WOLFEYES> if you look at the site it has a drop down box, just under the options, "Show details" "Binary Details VMware Player for Linux 32-bit".
[09:21] <Kilos> then see if you can right click extract\
[09:22] <WOLFEYES> nope
[09:22] <Kilos> ai
[09:22] <Kilos> guys are busy, hope you can wait some
[09:23] <Kilos> tell the client patience is a virtue
[09:24] <inetpro> hmm...
[09:24] <inetpro> WAYTTD?
[09:24] <Kilos> ah here the pro
[09:24] <Kilos> he needs that to be able to help a client inetpro 
[09:25] <inetpro> to do what?
[09:25] <Kilos> i have no idea
[09:25] <WOLFEYES> llol
[09:25] <Kilos> they have it installed is all i know
[09:26] <Kilos> WOLFEYES, explaint what you are trying to do
[09:26] <Kilos> explain
[09:26] <inetpro> WOLFEYES: WAYTTD?
[09:26] <WOLFEYES> I am trying to get aquainted with the program inetpro 
[09:27] <inetpro> WOLFEYES: you mean with vmware specifically?
[09:27] <inetpro> or do you need a virtual OS installed on top of your KDE?
[09:27] <WOLFEYES> I know nothing of it and have time and attendance readers at my client and this software is stopping my readers from communicating.
[09:28] <WOLFEYES> yes with vmware
[09:28] <Kilos> hi kbmonkey 
[09:28] <kbmonkey> Hi kilos. 
[09:28] <kbmonkey> You are on everyday lately
[09:29]  * inetpro uses virtualbox to run other OSses in a VM
[09:29] <Kilos> yip 8ta 2+1 rocks
[09:29] <WOLFEYES> Heya kbmonkey 
[09:29] <kbmonkey> I got the same deal :)
[09:29] <kbmonkey> Hi inetpro, wolfeyes
[09:29] <inetpro> wb kbmonkey
[09:29] <kbmonkey> Inetpro, ever used qemu with kvm?
[09:29] <inetpro> kbmonkey: early lunch?
[09:29] <kbmonkey> It flies
[09:30] <inetpro> kbmonkey: yes and no
[09:30] <kbmonkey> No, waiting for the technician to install a line under my desk
[09:30] <inetpro> yes I tried using it but ended up going back to VirtualBox
[09:31]  * inetpro don't need VM machines very often
[09:34] <WOLFEYES> Ok but how do I install this download ?
[09:34] <WOLFEYES> In kde.
[09:35]  * WOLFEYES goes to try other things.
[09:35] <inetpro> WOLFEYES: unfortunately I don't have the time now to go and have a look. Have never done it and have no need for it.
[09:36]  * inetpro prefers to stick to free stuffs in the repositories
[09:37] <inetpro> s/free stuffs/stable, free and supported software/
[09:40] <WOLFEYES> ty inetpro it is in the repo's, but I want to load this as I will use their help later on at the clients site. I just wanted to get the basics before I get to the client and not know a thing.
[09:40] <inetpro> WOLFEYES: what is in the repo's?
[09:41] <inetpro> hmm...
[09:42]  * inetpro finds vmware-manager in the repos
[09:42] <inetpro> interesting!
[09:42] <inetpro> never used it though, but can't be all that difficult
[09:43] <WOLFEYES> it asks me with what application do I want to open it with.....?

[18:10] <smile> yeah.. some work that needs to be done for next friday :)
[18:10] <smile> next week Friday, I mean
[18:13] <smile> How do I say bungler in Afrikaans? :p
[18:13] <smile> knoër? (knoeier?)
[18:16] <inetpro> smile: the last one
[18:16] <inetpro> knoeier
[18:16] <inetpro> but in all my years I've never seen the word bungler before
[18:16] <inetpro> never to old to learn
[18:17] <smile> yeah :DD
[18:17] <smile> Then I was correct ;)
[18:17] <smile> inetpro: does "Prutser" also exist? :p
[18:17] <inetpro> hmm... 
[18:17] <inetpro> smile: context?
[18:19] <inetpro> smile: you mean for the same word?
[18:19] <smile> inetpro: well, someone is doing something gawky
[18:19] <smile> so I say, prutser :p
[18:19] <smile> (in Dutch)
[18:20] <smile> :p
[18:20] <inetpro> hmm... ek ken nie die woord prutser in Afrikaans nie
[18:20] <smile> :(
[18:20] <smile> do you know what it means? :)
[18:20] <inetpro> maar ek kyk gou in die woordeboek
[18:21] <smile> :DD
[18:21] <smile> http://www.audioenglish.net/dictionary/potterer.htm = Prutser :p
[18:21] <inetpro> hmm,,,
[18:22] <inetpro> prutsel, prutselaar, prutselwerk
[18:22] <Kilos> sjoe
[18:22] <inetpro> Kilos: ken jy van 'n prutser?
[18:23] <Kilos> nog nooit daai woord gehoor nie
[18:23] <smile> http://www.authsecu.com/dictionnaire/africain-divers.php :)
[18:23] <Kilos> smile where you found that word
[18:24] <inetpro> somebody put that up already on google translate
[18:24] <inetpro> http://translate.google.com/#auto/af/potterer
[18:24] <inetpro> but I'm not convinced
[18:24] <smile> Kilos: in Dutch ;)
[18:25] <Kilos> ah
[18:25] <smile> I wonder if it exists in Afrikaans :)
[18:25] <Kilos> lemme check in dikpensmerrie
[18:26] <inetpro> ahh
[18:26] <inetpro> there's the word prutsery in my Afrikaans-English dictionary
[18:27] <inetpro> stands for tinkering, niggling or bungling
[18:28] <inetpro> smile: so based on that I guess you could talk about a "prutser"
[18:29] <smile> :)
[18:29] <inetpro> hang on
[18:29] <smile> Lol.
[18:29] <Kilos> prutsel=niggle, tinkle potter fiddle
[18:29] <inetpro> smile: prutselaar 
[18:29] <inetpro> that ^^ is the correct form for a tenkerer
[18:30] <inetpro> or a potterer
[18:30] <smile> are you a prutselaar, inetpro ? :p
[18:30] <inetpro> ai!
[18:30] <Kilos> prutselaar =tinkerer potterer
[18:31] <smile> I know ;)
[18:31] <inetpro> smile: sounds funny, to be honest
[18:32] <Kilos> prutdery =tinkering, niggling bungling
[18:32] <inetpro> not a word that I have heard often, if at all
[18:32] <Kilos> definitely not a well used word
[18:32] <smile> what would you use instead, Kilos ? :p
[18:33] <Kilos> hmm
[18:33] <Kilos> is this for someone that fiddles with everything but maily unsuccessfully
[18:33] <Kilos> bungling is making a mess of things
[18:34] <Kilos> s/maily/mainly
[18:34] <inetpro> Kilos: knoeiery?
[18:35] <inetpro> of brouwerk?
[18:35] <Kilos> isnt that more what skelms do?
[18:35] <Kilos> brouwerk ja
[18:35] <inetpro> onbeholpe
[18:35] <inetpro> sukkelrig
[18:35] <smile> :p
[18:36] <smile> well, just trying to do something but "sukkel" while doing it xD
[18:36] <inetpro> Kilos: I would say those last two
[18:36] <smile> and you come to a result close, but not the same :p
[18:36] <Kilos> lol what are we looking for a translation for
[18:37] <Kilos> potterer
[18:37] <inetpro> Kilos: of droogmaker
[18:37] <Kilos> haha ja
[18:38]  * nlsthzn just ran into a utility to install x11 under osx... seems it is still being developed and used by some people for mac's... 
[18:38] <inetpro> smile: sukkelaar?
[18:38] <smile> ja :p something like that :p
[18:38] <smile> but not really. :p
[18:39] <inetpro> ai!
[18:39] <inetpro> gaan ons toets skryf hieroor?
[18:39] <Kilos> sukkelaar is good  but that is a battler
[18:39] <Kilos> battler with everything or certain things might be different
[18:40] <inetpro> nlsthzn: that sounds old
[18:40] <smile> nee, inetpro :)
[18:40] <inetpro> lol
[18:40] <Kilos> sjoe
[18:40] <smile> aalagtig -> like an aal (fish?)
[18:40] <smile> correct? :p
[18:40] <inetpro> smile: yebo yes
[18:40] <smile> ok :p weird.. :p
[18:40] <nlsthzn> inetpro, in the utility folder for osx 10.8.2 mountain lion... can't get newer than that :p
[18:41] <inetpro> yikes
[18:41] <nlsthzn> seems apple and community is developing it still... odd
[18:41] <inetpro> nlsthzn: osx is some form of X windows
[18:42] <inetpro> so I don't see the point of install x11 on topof that
[18:45] <inetpro> Maaz: coffee on
[18:45]  * Maaz puts the kettle on
[18:46] <Kilos> whew
[18:46] <Kilos> Maaz, coffee please
[18:46] <Maaz> Kilos: Done
[18:46] <Kilos> Maaz, large

[18:46] <smile> what does makeout mean? :p
[18:46] <smile> http://lolfunnypictures.net/wtf-are-we-going-to-have-s3x-and-make-out
[18:46] <Kilos> Maaz, define makeout
[18:46] <Maaz> Kilos: I don't know about makeout. Maybe you meant takeout?
[18:46] <Kilos> hehe
[18:46] <inetpro> lol
[18:47] <smile> this? :p
[18:47] <smile> Engage in sexual foreplay or intercourse, as in Bill and Jane were making out on the sofa, or Joe bragged that he made out last night. [Slang; early 1900s]
[18:48] <inetpro> sjoe!
[18:48] <inetpro> Kilos: can you make that out?
[18:48] <inetpro> where's our lingo specialists like superfly when we need them
[18:48] <Kilos> thats modern peeps slang
[18:49] <inetpro> :-)
[18:49] <superfly> taking children to bed
[18:49] <inetpro> superfly: no worries
[18:49]  * inetpro just checking
[18:49] <Maaz> Coffee's ready for inetpro and Kilos!
[18:49] <Kilos> Maaz, danke
[18:49] <Maaz> Bitteschön
[18:49] <superfly> make out means different things depending on where you come from.
[18:49] <inetpro> Maaz: dankie ou maat
[18:49] <Maaz> inetpro: *blink*
[18:49]  * superfly has children to take care of
[18:50] <inetpro> superfly: go read some story for them
[18:50] <inetpro> and then come back for a change
[18:50] <inetpro> don't fall asleep
[18:50] <Kilos> inetpro, kids say lets hang and makeout
[18:51] <Kilos> mainly learned from american junk movies
[18:51] <inetpro> superfly: the aim is to get the kids to fall asleep
[18:52] <Kilos> hahaha
[18:55] <inetpro> Kilos: dit reen hier
[18:55] <inetpro> wel, drup
[18:55] <Kilos> stuur

[18:56] <Kilos> as dit reen miskien
[18:56] <inetpro> nou sal my watlemoene lekker groei
[18:57] <inetpro> en die lietjies, mangos en avos
[18:58] <Kilos> as dit goed reen ja
[18:58] <Kilos> as ek onthou sal ek more vir jou n kiekie neem van misbredie
[18:59] <Kilos> en as skape en voels saam speel sal ek saad oes as daar kom
[18:59] <inetpro> Kilos: ek's nie desperaat nie
[18:59] <Kilos> ek weet maar jy sal sien dis beter as daai kleinblaar marog
[18:59] <Kilos> en te vroeg vir saad nou
[19:01] <Kilos> ken jy van die bredie maak
[19:01] <Kilos> inetpro, ^
[19:02] <inetpro> Kilos: miskien, miskien nie
[19:02] <inetpro> Kilos: hoe maak jy dit?
[19:02] <Kilos> braai uie entomatie
[19:02] <Kilos> braai fry
[19:02] <inetpro> fry?
[19:02] <smile> wat is zeboe, inetpro ? :p
[19:03] <inetpro> smile: nee, ek weet nie
[19:03] <inetpro> smile: wat is dit?
[19:03] <Kilos> then you put that in a pot with the marog in and add quite a few potatoes cut smallish
[19:03] <smile> De zeboe of het bultrund (Bos taurus indicus) is een rund dat in het Indische subcontinent en Afrika wordt gedomesticeerd, en voornamelijk in tropische en subtropische klimaten gehouden wordt. Het dier wordt gekarakteriseerd door de grote bult achter de nek.
[19:03] <Kilos> when potatoes soft you kinda mash it a bit
[19:03] <smile> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bos_taurus_indicus.jpg
[19:03] <smile> @ inetpro 
[19:04] <smile> I found a mistake :o In a French word list of Afrikaans words
[19:04] <smile> http://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seboe
[19:04] <Kilos> the tomatoes remove some of the bitterness
[19:04] <inetpro> sjoe Kilos, ken jy daai gedierte?
[19:04] <Kilos> dont forget salt
[19:04] <inetpro> Kilos: wat is fry?

[19:09] <Kilos> brahman was part of the original input if im not mistaken
[19:09] <Kilos> and afrikaner
[19:10] <Kilos> and some others
[19:10] <smile> Kilos: http://www.bonsmara.co.za/ ? :p
[19:10] <smile>  Bonsmara is die enigste ras ter wêreld wat deur 'n goed gedokumenteerde kruisteelprogram ontwikkel is, met behulp van objektiewe aantekening van prestasie data.
[19:11] <Kilos> they have been our top beef breed for years now methinks
[19:12] <Kilos> those cuts in the ears are how they are numbered for identification purposes
[19:13] <smile> Kilos: it must be a painful process :(
[19:14] <Kilos> nope its about the same as peeps piercing their ears for earrings
[19:14] <Kilos> special tool clips it out
[19:16] <superfly> in hte USA, to "make out" means to kiss and hug and cuddle and pet each other
[19:16] <smile> I never understood the concept of earrings. :p
[19:16] <superfly> in the UK, to "make out" means to have sex
[19:16] <Kilos> pure sa breed like the drakensberger
[19:16] <Kilos> kafoofle

[19:22] <inetpro> Kilos: en hulle het die lekkerste melk

[19:24]  * inetpro sal by die bure moet bedel vir weiding

[19:40] <Kilos> night all sleep tight. see ya morrow
[19:40] <Kilos> eeek
[19:40] <Kilos> always something
[20:19] <Squirm>  great, we all want to have boot issues at 22:22
[20:21] <Squirm> oh, so now it decides to boot
[20:24] <kbmonkey> sup Squirm 
[20:24] <Squirm> hello kbmonkey 
[20:26] <kbmonkey> it is booting now?
[20:27] <kbmonkey> I'm going to try update my android firmware.
[20:27] <Squirm> it booted
[20:27] <Squirm> it never booted the first time, so hit the restart button
[20:27] <Squirm> all i saw was a black screen. 2nd time it booted into the recovery console
[20:27] <Squirm> hit restart
[20:27] <Squirm> and voila
[20:27] <kbmonkey> ah
[20:28] <kbmonkey> could be a disk spin-up delay.
[20:28] <kbmonkey> some bios'es have option to set a delay to wait for disk to spin up before it tries to boot
[20:28] <Squirm> I've had this pc for 6 years and have had no such problem
[20:30] <kbmonkey> be sure to take regular backups just in case :)
