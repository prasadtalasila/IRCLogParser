[00:00] <OerHeks> gskellig, maybe you want to checkout the #bumblebee channel too
[00:00] <Celso> gskellig, stick with bumblebee because with vgaswitcheroo, i can't alternate from intel to ati.
[00:00] <xius> is there anyone around that can help me install 12.04 onto my mac? I'm experiencing some issues I haven't seen in any tute.
[00:00] <gskellig> Celso, I'm confused, isn't that the point? That you can switch back and forth
[00:01] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: Do you understand what happened now?
[00:01] <pamela> hi can eny one know program "gnome disk utility" ? I have install it but i cant see my hardrives there
[00:01] <blunted> Xius ask away no idea if help can be given
[00:02] <Celso> gskellig, well, it is but hybrid graphics on linux is curently problematic. in theory, vgaswitcheroo should work but for now, i didnt found yet a solution.
[00:02] <xius> when I ran the installer, it encountered an error when installing grub, so I decided to restart my mac holding "alt" so I could boot into OS X again
[00:03] <xius> except, the only disk it showed availible to load was "Windows" which I had not seen before
[00:03] <blunted> Gskellig, this doesn't work right windows yet and its nvidia.  I wish you the new of uck
[00:03] <jhutchins_wk> xius: Try thatl refit may have mistaken it.
[00:03] <xius> rEFIt didn't even load.
[00:03] <gskellig> I'm not really interested in the "hybrid" as much as I am just being able to switch between one or another
[00:04] <gskellig> I don't mind doing it manually, I want my laptop on the integrated graphcis 90% of the time anyway
[00:04] <Celso> gskellig, for me, to be able to use intell i need to use sleep 6 comand on /rc.local file  but if i dont use that command, i am not able to switch it
[00:04] <gskellig> ah gotcha
[00:04] <L3top> gskellig: I assume you are on an ati hybrid?
[00:04] <roasted> Well that's fun. I have my server running with two mirrored drives via mdadm. To test a fault, I powered it off, unhooked one drive, and booted up. I said y to boot degraded and things worked fine on a single drive. So, I powered back off, plugged in the other hdd, powered up, and now it's booting up degraded each and every single flipping time. Nice.
[00:05] <gskellig> no L3top nvidia
[00:05] <daftykins> roasted: sounds epic
[00:05] <gskellig> Nvidia GT218M
[00:05] <roasted> it pretty much is
[00:05] <roasted> never hadt his happen before
[00:05] <Celso> gskellig : yes, ati 5000 series+ intel hd3000
[00:05] <L3top> gskellig: you want bumblebee
[00:05] <blunted> Xius are you doing a dual boot or standard load
[00:05] <Celso> gskellig : but mst of time i use intel.
[00:06] <xius> both produce the same result
[00:06] <L3top> no
[00:06] <Celso> gskellig : by the way, did the brightness link worked?
[00:06] <xius> "Missing operating system"
[00:06] <gmulak_> Is anyone here going to SCaLe 11x?  So Calif Linux Expo at the LAX Hilton?  Here? http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x
[00:06] <L3top> I am
[00:06] <gskellig> Celso, I'm waiting for a minute because I read that installing a different nvidia driver might work
[00:06] <L3top> re SCaLe
[00:06] <gskellig> going to try that first then try your link. It's bookmarked =P
[00:06] <Celso> oh ok
[00:06] <Celso> no problem
[00:06] <gmulak_> L3top:  cool - I will be at the Ubuntu booth
[00:07] <daftykins> roasted: never used it if i'm honest, but are there any status utils you can try to see if it's even trying? or something to run to 'provoke' it?
[00:07] <L3top> gskellig: there is only one solution worth seeking with nvidia hybrid... bumblebee
[00:07] <L3top> gmulak_: I will be there under LinuxMCE
[00:07] <roasted> daftykins: I have no idea. I ran cat /proc/mdstat and I can see it thinks /dev/sdc is missing. However, blkid shows sdb and sdc are there and active.

[00:12] <histo> L3top: Also from what Sara describing what happened. She didn't even overwrite any of the vfiles on the ubuntu partition. That data was most likely untouched on the drive.  The partion was deleted it was dual partitioned at the half way point of the disk.  Then windows created a parttion and installed to the begining of the desk where it was originally. Not even touching the second half of the disk
[00:13] <L3top> histo... this is a support channel... you can come complain at me in #linuxmce too.
[00:13] <L3top> I AM there.

[00:16] <L3top> !nounity
[00:16] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[00:16] <histo> frowni: you can uninstall it. Or just switch de's
[00:16] <SonikkuAmerica> frowni: [ sudo apt-get {remove | purge} unity ]
[00:16] <Sara_> Im back send me a message please

[00:17] <L3top> You cannot use the word because.
[00:18] <histo> Sara_: Are the files that were on your ubuntu partition worth the time to attempt to recover? ex: jpgs oo docs etc....
[00:18] <daftykins> SonikkuAmerica: are you catching the messages from Sara_ above?
[00:18] <SonikkuAmerica> daftykins, I did.
[00:18] <daftykins> ok :)
[00:19] <L3top> histo... why would her arbitrary evaluation of worth matter? Sounds like backing down from the challenge to me.

[00:19] <Brewster> is there a suggestion box of some sort for ubuntu?

[00:40] <UlyssesGa> Hi there!  Repeat question from earlier today (I had to step away).  I'm having a problem dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04.  Non-UEFI system (so no Secure boot).  Each installation is on its own hard drive, with the Ubuntu drive being the set as the primary bootable device in the system BIOS. (grub2 also situated on linux drive).
[00:40] <UlyssesGa> If Win8 is set as the first bootable HD, it starts fine.  If the Ubuntu drive is chosen as the 1st bootable drive and I attempt to boot to Win 8 from grub, Win8 immediately reboots.
[00:43] <dr_willis> ive seen systems (bios's) that swap hds around. so that whatever hd boots.. becomes sda.  that would mean when you boot the win8 drive directly its sda. but when grub boots it from the 2nd hd.. it would become sdb..  that might confuse windows..   (not sire if this IS the issue. but ive seen that issue)
[00:46] <phoenixsampras> hellowzor
[00:49] <OerHeks> dr_willis, should UlyssesGa set boot on the 2nd drive and run update-grub to change the windows entry /
[00:49] <OerHeks> ?
[00:50] <dr_willis> OerHeks:  he could try.
[00:50] <dr_willis> but hes allready ran update-grub to get grub on the hd.. i dont think the entry will change

[01:24] <Miebster> When I plug in my iphone 5 into my macbook pro retina 10,1 with ubuntu 12.10, I get a modal dialog box that says "unable to mount iphone" the okay button doesn't work, the close button doens't work, there is no window title.  Any thoughts on what this is or how to fix it?

[01:26] <jbas> I am trying to understand what is happening with the Skype for Linux
[01:27] <Guest97420> i was wondering if there is any good programs to run that will help videos buffer faster and play better
[01:27] <jbas> I just installed and after 5 min, shutdown
[01:27] <somsip> jbas: how did you install?
[01:28] <jbas> I just downloaded from skype web site
[01:28] <histo> jbas: dunno you'd have to ask them.
[01:28] <somsip> jbas: maybe best to use the version in the repos if you're having problems. I think you have to enable the partners repo list
[01:28] <histo> jbas: see if you can file a bug or something.
[01:29] <jbas> Sorry, but I am new in Linux
[01:29] <nathan_> can anyone help me with wifi drivers for my W530?
[01:29] <jbas> What is Repo List?
[01:29] <Guest97420> i have plash aid and download helper, can anyone tell me if there is something that will make videos buffer faster?
[01:29] <somsip> jbas: what version of ubuntu are you on?
[01:29] <Guest97420> *flash
[01:29] <jbas> 12.04 LTS
[01:30] <tylerwoodward> Is it safe to remove everything in Not Installed (residual config) or would it mess something up?
[01:30] <somsip> jbas: 32 or 64 bit?
[01:30] <jbas> 64
[01:31] <somsip> jbas: remove the downloaded version you installed and follow the instructions here http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-skype-in-ubuntu-12-04precise.html

[01:57] <Guest34347> JokesOnYou77, Does ubuntu-restricted-extras not do that?
[01:58] <JokesOnYou77> Guest34347, Adding restricted-extras to your sources allows you to download additional packages not supported by connonical, it doesn't automatically install anything for you thoguh

[02:03] <JokesOnYou77> Guest34347, do you want to fix it using the software center or manually with the terminal?  I haven't used Lubuntu in a log time so I don't know what else is available to you

[02:05] <LikePuzzle> How can I fix a sound problem in the ubuntu 10.04?
[02:06] <dr_willis> !alsa
[02:06] <ubottu> If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[02:06] <nomodeset> !mint
[02:06] <ubottu> Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org

[02:06] <ubottu> A list of official Ubuntu IRC channels, as well as IRC clients for Ubuntu, can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat - For a general list of !freenode channels, see http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#channellist - See also !Guidelines
[02:06] <JokesOnYou77> Guest34347, that will bring up the file that lists all of the software repositories available to your system in a terminal-based text editor called nano
[02:07] <JokesOnYou77> Guest343
[02:08] <JokesOnYou77> Guest34347, The lines that start with a # are commented out and not read by apt. All you should have to do is comment out those duplicate lines.  If they're not there is one other place to look as well, but it's unlikely
[02:08] <Guest34347> JokesOnYou77, http://pastebin.com/LH5q0wSY
[02:10] <JokesOnYou77> Guest34347, unless you're not finished installing your system or you always run with the disk in for some reason you should comment out both of the lines with the cdrom

[02:17] <JokesOnYou77> Guest34347, you shouldn't have to reboot.  Windows makes you reboot all the darn time because it has to make changes to protected system files and such, unless you're changing drivers you rarely have to reboot in ubuntu
[02:17] <JokesOnYou77> Guest34347, what do you mean according to the command line?

[02:58] <folorn> think anyone else could help with killing a process please ?
[02:58] <cfhowlett> tripelb, if this an ubuntu only machine?  restart your installation, wipe/format the hdd and then install.
[02:59] <cfhowlett> folorn, kill -9 process
[03:01] <folorn> thanks cfhowlett lemme see if it works
[03:02] <tripelb> i have a windiws partition too. cfhowlett ans an nt recovery. i

[03:02] <gskellig> Can someone help me get nvidia drivers working
[03:02] <folorn> how can i view the process's again?
[03:02] <tripelb> cfhowlett: reading man fdisk
[03:02] <gskellig> they are not showing up in additional drivers
[03:02] <cfhowlett> tripelb, OK.  reboot the installation media, delete that LVM partition
[03:03] <folorn> how ya list all of the process's running?

[03:05] <mikehaas763> Hello. I noticed in Win 7 when using keyboard shortcuts to align a window to say the right half of my screen, if I keep doing it will move to my other monitor (I have dual screen). Is there a similar functionality in Ubuntu?
[03:05] <tripelb> how? cfhowlett gparted sees no partitions at all. i just checked.
[03:05] <mikehaas763> I guess any kind of keyboard shortcut to move a window to my other monitor would be awesome
[03:08] <folorn> here's a vpaste of the processes running on the box atm any ideas then which i should kill?
[03:08] <folorn> http://vpaste.net/RcUpD
[03:09] <ulkesh> folorn: what's stuck again?
[03:10] <cfhowlett> ulkesh, updates ... see the bottom of the image
[03:10] <gizmobay> df -h will tell me my temp size?
[03:10] <gizmobay> tmp
[03:10] <ulkesh> cfhowlett: good call :)
[03:10] <somsip> gizmobay: du -h /tmp
[03:11] <ulkesh> folorn: update-notifier (4141) or python /usr/lib/software-properties/softwa (4962) would be my guess
[03:11] <folorn> ya its stuck in like the updateing part wont let access to my updater
[03:12] <folorn> i kinda was thinking the same 1sec
[03:12] <gizmobay> ls -al what is the units for the file size? Kb or MB?
[03:12] <ulkesh> folorn: i sometimes see the updater look like it's stuck, but actually it's simply wanting some input on the "command line" of it (where you expand the details of what's going on)
[03:12] <ulkesh> folorn: usually during the configuration phase of some update/new install of an app
[03:13] <tripelb> dear cfhowlett i have deleted it. when man was no help i googled ...
[03:13] <cfhowlett> tripelb, fingers crossed
[03:14] <folorn> ya it liked asked for my pw but then lagged and quit out during it
[03:14] <tripelb> cf now gparted still sees no partitions at all
[03:14] <fresno> waz going on room
[03:14] <cfhowlett> cfhowlett, not even your windows parts?
[03:14] <tripelb> cfhowlett:  now gparted still sees no partitions at all
[03:15] <fresno> windows 7 suxs
[03:15] <ulkesh> folorn: also look at this one:  root      4155  4037  0 20:26 pts/6    00:00:00 /usr/bin/dpkg --status-fd 14 --configure -
[03:15] <TheLordOfTime> can anyone think of a reason that generating an 8192-bit SSH key would be practical?
[03:15] <folorn> well wtf
[03:15] <tripelb> cfhowlett: no means no. i refreshed devices.
[03:15] <folorn> yes that was one as  well it was giving a error before the install
[03:15] <RocketLauncher> It looks like i have NO FONTS. I can select them but it shows no preview and it doesnt work. Profont is the only font that works and that's probably because I manually installed it myself.. how do i get everything back
[03:16] <fresno> zorin is good liunxs
[03:16] <Drumroll> i want to make a live USB for my brand new PC build
[03:16] <ulkesh> TheLordOfTime: to require a computer a gazillion years of something to do by trying to brute-force crack it? :)
[03:16] <tripelb> cfhowlett: for a while i was stuck in grub rescue, then i reinstalled windows xp and afterwards got a choice at boot.. but nada from gparted
[03:17] <folorn> finally got it
[03:17] <Drumroll> checked it ahead of time for compatibility drivers-wise, but got rev 1.1 with new network card
[03:17] <ulkesh> folorn: sweet, which one?
[03:17] <folorn> thanks you guys ..any ideas how to repair
[03:17] <folorn> that dkg deal
[03:17] <Drumroll> My network card is not supported by the kernel, but there is a package.
[03:17] <Drumroll> Anyway to create the USB with that package installed. so that the netowkr will work??
[03:17] <tripelb> Fresno  xp
[03:18] <fresno> boot usb stick
[03:18] <folorn> ulkesh now it will update again lol woot thanks alot
[03:18] <TheLordOfTime> ulkesh:  heh
[03:18] <codepython7771> how do i test the speed of my network using a ssh login? Both incoming and outgoing? Is there a tool to do this?
[03:18] <ulkesh> folorn: oh sweet, i hope it stays happy!
[03:18] <fresno> to make boot usb stick
[03:18] <dr_willis> Drumroll:  what kind of package?
[03:19] <Drumroll> package: linux-backports-modules-cw-3.4-precise-generic
[03:19] <tripelb> cfhowlett: i need to switch debices brb
[03:19] <fresno> brb
[03:19] <Drumroll> + dependencies
[03:19] <dr_willis> Drumroll:  and its in the repos?
[03:19] <fresno> rbr
[03:20] <zykotick9> codepython7771: test or monitor?  bmon is a terminal network monitor.  no idea on "test".
[03:20] <Drumroll> dr_willis: yes its in the repo
[03:20] <Drumroll> would install with apt-get install package_name
[03:20] <Drumroll> BUT without network, that's not an option
[03:20] <Drumroll> I would like to download updates as I install as well
[03:20] <dr_willis> Drumroll:  issues ive seen with live  usbs are that if you apt-get install kernel and drivers.. they may not get used by the live setupo
[03:20] <dr_willis> Drumroll:  a full install would let you install them however.
[03:21] <dr_willis> but a full instal on usb.. wont let you install to other systems
[03:21] <Drumroll> Ok so I should install first, then download the packages onto USB later and install them manually
[03:21] <Drumroll> i dont want to install ON usb, just from
[03:21] <Drumroll> I was hoping to install the drivers with the OS
[03:21] <cfhowlett> Drumroll, use the DVD iso, install THEN update
[03:21] <fresno> UNetbootin
[03:21] <dr_willis> Drumroll:  and that woul dbe a live usb.. and from what ive seen.. you dont  just install new kerneles/drivers on a live usb and expect them to work.
[03:22] <Drumroll> got it
[03:22] <fresno> ok
[03:22] <tripelb> Flannel I have partitions I do not want to overwrite
[03:22] <fresno> ok
[03:22] <Flannel> tripelb: So, you don't know which ones they are then? or what?
[03:22] <dr_willis> ive had issues in the past with live-usbs where you insstall for example a newer kernel. or nvidia drivers.. well they get stored in the persistant save file.. but the system cant boot from them
[03:22] <fresno> do u got a windowz t
[03:23] <fresno> do u got windos 7
[03:23] <cfhowlett> fresno, think he said he's got XP  :)
[03:23] <dr_willis> you may need to remaster your own live setup
[03:23] <fresno> do u got windos 7
[03:24] <dr_willis> Drumroll:  or do a full install to a 8gb usb. install what you need.. then clone the usb to the hd of the system you want to install on.   ;)
[03:24] <folorn> is there anyway to check and see if your wireless driver is up to date?
[03:25] <fresno> are u new to liunxs
[03:25] <cfhowlett> folorn, if it works?  Also, enable backports will capture, well, backports.
[03:25] <dr_willis> !backport
[03:25] <ubottu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they may go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports - See also !packaging
[03:26] <xorox90__> is there any default log(connection ip, time .. etc) on ubuntu? should I install additional program?
[03:26] <Drumroll> dr_willis : can I do a full install to USB using unetbootin? or different method?
[03:26] <dr_willis> !u | fresno
[03:26] <ubottu> fresno: U is the 21st letter of the modern latin alphabet. Neither 'U' nor 'Ur' are words in the English language. Neither are 'R', 'Y', 'l8', 'ryt',  'Ne1' nor 'Bcuz'.

[03:26] <tripelb> cfhowlett: I have to mount something to update grub  it says. Since I have no idea I am going to try to fix grub. I am a bit in the dark. There's a web page roasted suggested..   http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/how-to-recover-grub2-linux.html
[03:26] <dr_willis> Drumroll:  that wouldent be a full install..
[03:27] <cfhowlett> !grub|tripelb,
[03:27] <ubottu> tripelb,: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[03:27] <tripelb> That's where I was when we started
[03:27] <cfhowlett> tripelb, OK.  Take you time.  I had multiple grub headaches when I was triple booting ubuntu/windows/osx but it can be done.
[03:28] <Drumroll> dr_willis would I need ... two usbs, or a usb and a DVD?
[03:28] <tripelb> cfhowlett: been there no help. That's when roasted came in some hours ago. Took me a while to read the page and see what applied, sadly it didn't.
[03:28] <dr_willis> Drumroll:  yep.. one to install from to a usb...
[03:28] <fresno>   do u got windoes 7
[03:28] <dr_willis> fresno:  do you  have an actual ubuntu support question?

=== fish is now known as Guest75795
[03:29] <cfhowlett> tripelb, Assume that your windows and ubuntu are actually installed.  Just need to configure grub correctly.  I made the mistake of reinstalling multiple times.  Ultimately, it was  an easily fixed grub issue
[03:29] <fresno> windos 7 usb boot
[03:29] <tripelb> cfhowlett: roasted it is my fault. I said install and didn't realize that *I* had to make a swap partition. I was trying to replace an Ubuntu partition and if messed me up.
[03:29] <janderson91z> can someone tell me how to open the catalyst control center? i have the drivers installed and working, but i don't see the icons in 12.04 and when i type in the terminal "gksudo amdcccle" nothing happens
[03:30] <fresno> if u all need help hit me up
=== mike is now known as Guest19437
[03:31] <dr_willis> fresno:  im not sure anyone has  unstood anything you have said in the last half hour.
[03:31] <tripelb> cfhowlett: windows is installed. Ubuntu is not. In fact there is no longer a partition there. NT is installed. I used that to run a dell "check your hardware" way back over a week ago when I was given this old underpowered computer.
[03:32] <tripelb> I booted to that partition
[03:32] <cfhowlett> tripelb, old computer?  OK.  Try this.  Stop with the ubuntu and install lubuntu or xubuntu.  Both are optimized for older and lower spec machines.
[03:33] <folorn> is there a way to do that ?
[03:34] <fresno> zliunxs is good
[03:36] <dr_willis> folorn:  do what? ive missed somthing.
[03:36] <cfhowlett> tripelb, had a thought: if this machine has NT, then I assume it was configured as a server, which would explain why it defaulted to the LVM, i.e. server, partitioning scheme.  Start over, wipe all the buntu partitions, leave the windows partitions in place.
[03:37] <Drumroll> is a swap partition always necessary?
[03:37] <Drumroll> If I understand correctly, swap partition comes into use when ram is maxed out. What if you have 16GB ? Can you go without?
[03:37] <cfhowlett> Drumroll, only if you want to be able to suspend/hibernate
[03:38] <dr_willis> Drumroll:  i got no swap on my desktop box
[03:38] <dr_willis> 8gb ram.. just hope you dont run out of ram ;)
[03:38] <zykotick9> Drumroll: wap CAN be used when ram is maxed, but it's used more often to move non-used stuff out of physical memory.  with 16GB you can certainly get away without swap, but it will be slightly slower (see "/msg ubottu swap" for more details)
[03:39] <janderson91z> can someone help me get the amd catalyst control center to open?
[03:40] <Coded1> I'm running a FX-6100 @ 3.2GHz, Vertex 3 120GB SSD, 16GB PC1600 system on 13.04.  Why is software centre so slow?  I click to install one app and it greys out the window for about 40s and remains unresponsive for another 30s.  Clicking to install subsequent packages takes even longer.
[03:40] <dr_willis> try running it as  user janderson91z ? if theres no error messages..  not a lot we can really debug.. guess you coud run the debugger    gdb on it as it runs
[03:40] <tripelb> cfhowlett: I may have misspoken, not a server. Reading more on the web, I just did  >lsb-l /Dev/disk/by-label
[03:40] <tripelb> Noooo
[03:41] <dr_willis> Coded1:   13.04 in #uubntu+1    -- its in testing... so expect issues
[03:41] <dr_willis>   #ubuntu+1
[03:41] <janderson91z> run it as user as in just type in amdcccle in the terminal?
[03:41] <janderson91z> says command not found
[03:41] <janderson91z> is that not what it's called? amdcccle
[03:41] <dr_willis> janderson91z:  i  have no idea what its called
[03:41] <dr_willis>  try amd<tab>
[03:42] <cfhowlett> tripelb, noted.  still if this box was running NT, I'd say x/l/ubuntu are the way to go ...
[03:42] <Coded1> dr_willis: the release you run has no such problems?
[03:42] <dr_willis> Coded1:  never really noticed it being slow.. i tend to use the cli tools...
=== Brewster is now known as Brewster[afk]
[03:44] <janderson91z> well
[03:44] <Coded1> same here but mostly because it's faster than the gui, which on a decently quick system that I'm using kinda sucks
[03:44] <janderson91z> in synaptic it says i have fglrx-amdcccle installed
[03:44] <janderson91z> so i tried running it with that name
[03:44] <janderson91z> and same story, nothing happened. sorry, i'm new to actually using the terminal lol
[03:44] <dr_willis> janderson91z:  check the  'properties' of tghe package. and see what path it has to what files
[03:45] <Coded1> janderson91z: the command is 'amdcccle'
[03:45] <janderson91z> it says command not found
[03:46] <janderson91z> here are the file locations
[03:46] <janderson91z> http://pastebin.com/Xma4Ldw9
[03:46] <Coded1> should be in /usr/share/ati/amdcccle

[03:46] <proto> trying to use a bootable usb to install ubuntu on my laptop, reformatted the HDD and now it says 'Image failed to verify with *ACCESS DENIED*. Press any key to continue. and then powers off when I press a key
[03:47] <Drumroll> is there any reason not to use LVM ?
[03:48] <cfhowlett> proto, image?  iso image?  presumably you verified the iso integrity with md5sum??
[03:48] <proto> cfhowlett how do I do that?
[03:48] <cfhowlett> !md5sum|proto,
[03:49] <ubottu> proto,: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[03:49] <Coded1> proto: check the permissions of the image.  Is it owned by your user?
[03:49] <proto> cfhowlett, I can't even get to terminal
[03:50] <proto> Coded1, I'm not sure, I used Universal USB Installer, is there a way I can check that on my windows desktop?
[03:51] <janderson91z> well i found out it's located in /usr/share/ati and i am in that directory
[03:51] <proto> Looking through BIOS, does AHCI affect it? BIOS tells how it affects windows installations, but not linux
[03:51] <janderson91z> however when i type in amdcccle it says command not found, yet the file is clearly there when i type LS
[03:51] <tripelb> cfhowlett: I may have misspoken, not a server. And I clicked LVM by accident.  Reading more on the web, I just did  >lsb-l /Dev/disk/by-label  And my result shoed only 3 things now, not the 5 disk shows. They are, backup ..../sda4 which disk callsHPFS/NTFS/exFAT  And DellUtility..../sda1 Which fdisk calls the same.  And Ubuntu\x2012\x20LTS\x20i386   .../sr0 (sic)  which could be swap.  Meanwhile, XP is on /Dev/sda3 which fdisk callsW95 Ext'd
[03:52] <tripelb> cfhowlett: that was a bear to type
[03:52] <Coded1> proto: my bad if it's during the install then it's not your windows computer (not likely).  Try booting off the usb key and select verify image (or what ever the closest option is)
[03:52] <proto> cfhowlett, Coded1, I have a windows 8 laptop, and it looks like bios had some secure boot setting enabled, disabled that, rebooting now
[03:52] <cfhowlett> tripelb, no doubt.
[03:52] <tripelb> Random NOTE
[03:53] <cfhowlett> proto, proceed carefully.  secure boot weirdness ...
[03:53] <proto> cfhowlett, Coded1, secure boot was the problem, looking at desktop now.
[03:53] <proto> thanks for the help =D
[03:53] <Coded1> proto: ya that's likely it.  After the format it will try to install a GPT / MBR.  Secure boot will thwart that
[03:53] <cfhowlett> proto, smile son.  Have a beer.

[04:02] <folorn> sonikkuamerica you wouldn't happen to know if theres a way to see if  a wireless driver is up to date?
[04:02] <dartos> no it's a HDD with a windows and ubuntu partition
[04:02] <janderson91z> coded1: actually i just went into that directory in nautiluls and all i see is files named 'amdcccle_cs.qm and such

[04:04] <janderson91z> Coded1: ok, i found the correct directory with the two legit amd catalyst control center icons. when i click on either (regular or administrative) it says Details: Failed to execute child process "amdcccle" (No such file or directory)

[04:05] <tripelb> cfhowlett: that's too old sends me to fdisk, so I looked at man parted and going -l tells me --- can't have overlapping partitions. Oh I made the Ubuntu and the swap. I could have done it wrong. This is the first bit of meaning I see.
[04:06] <tripelb> Anyone here repartitoned with parted ? I seem to have overlapping partitions.
[04:06] <dartos> Coded1: it is basically this error over and over again http://pastebin.com/yKTNQQqT
[04:07] <SonikkuAmerica> tripelb: Why parted... as opposed to gparted?
[04:07] <tripelb> Is /xev/sr0 where grub goes?
[04:08] <dartos> zykotick9: I am runnin fsck on /dev/sda .. it's says superblock invalid
[04:09] <lauratika> how can i check the ink levels?
[04:09] <dartos> lauratika: thats more of a driver thing than an ubuntu thing. What printer do you have?
[04:09] <tripelb> SonikkuAmerica: gparted sees no partitions. That's the problem. fdisk does but is not for large partitions. Hence parted.
[04:10] <Coded1> dartos: can you paste the output of 'smartctl --all /dev/sda'
[04:10] <Coded1> smartctl --all /dev/sda | pastebinit
[04:10] <dartos> Coded1: it's not installed... I can't use apt-get because of the whole dpkg thing
[04:10] <dartos> But I ran smart tests with the disk utility and they all came back OK
[04:11] <coolspot> Why is WPA hotspot/adhoc disabled in 12.04?
[04:11] <Coded1> dartos: are you running a laptop?
[04:11] <dartos> Coded1: nope
[04:12] <dartos> Coded1: I had fedora running on here before but I decided to swtich.. more stable updates
[04:12] <dartos> Coded1: or so I thought -_- I remember 11.04 worked fine
[04:12] <Coded1> dartos: not sure if this will help but in your bios try to enable AHCI and disable any power saving options
[04:12] <tripelb> Should fdisk be listing /dev/sd0 ? Because it is not.   <-- basic idea need to clarify
[04:13] <dartos> AH
[04:13] <dartos> all of the sudden it found windows 7??
[04:13] <Coded1> dartos: apparently there was a problem with some distros where the HDD was parked too quick
[04:13] <dartos> Coded1: parked?
[04:14] <Coded1> dartos: power saving features will tell the drive to stop spinning and bring the needle to rest (park).  If that happens when the kernel isn't expecting it you get ... errors ;)
[04:14] <dartos> Coded1: I'll check if that's on during reboot
[04:14] <dartos> But I don't think it is
[04:14] <kerf> test
[04:15] <kerf> screen -d
[04:15] <kerf> woops
[04:15] <dartos> Coded1: NOW I can install the nvidia drivers and have a whole other mess to clean up -_-
[04:15] <dartos> I'll be back after reboot
[04:15] <Coded1> dartos: good luck

[04:18] <Drumroll> How do I install these packages offline?
[04:18] <Drumroll> How do I resolve the dependencies I mean
[04:19] <Drumroll> For example: how do I resolve this message: "Dependency is not satisfiable: linux-headers-3.5.0.22"
[04:19] <Drumroll> sorry linux-headers-3.5.0-22
[04:19] <Drumroll> how do I fix that
[04:20] <Coded1> Drumroll: can you download that package on a different computer?
[04:20] <Drumroll> Coded1: yes
=== Ubuntu is now known as Guest97028
[04:21] <Coded1> Drumroll: download it and install it with "dpkg -i linux-headers-..."
[04:21] <dartos> Coded1: Okay so I don't have that option but apparently if I just want the error goes away for that process... idk
[04:21] <Drumroll> Coded1 thanks, I will hop on linux and brb
[04:22] <Coded1> Drumroll: actually wait
[04:22] <Drumroll> ok
[04:22] <dartos> Coded1: but do you, by chance, know how to install the nvidia drivers? I tried installing linux-source and linux-headers-generic then the nvidia-current-updates package but nothing seems to work
[04:22] <g0rs> Does anybody use gedit ? Can you please include line numbers feature in the editor in next version of gedit?

=== qos is now known as qos|away
[04:22] <Coded1> Drumroll: try installing the package with "apt-get install --simulate packagename"
[04:23] <Coded1> dartos: what version of ubuntu are you running?
[04:23] <dartos> Coded1: 12.10.
[04:23] <zykotick9> g0rs: gedit has line numbering already?
[04:23] <dartos> Coded1: I hearded after I installed it about the nvidia drivers problem -_-
[04:23] <dartos> Coded1: sorry for saying hearded... I feel stupid
[04:23] <Coded1> lol np
[04:24] <dartos> It has been a long day of trying to get drivers working
[04:24] <dartos> I love these IRCs though the people are so helpful :D case in point Coded1
[04:24] <Coded1> dartos: when you say it doesn't seem to work what do you mean?
[04:24] <Drumroll> I am trying to install my atheros 8161 network drivers, linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-3.5.0-18-generic_3.5.0-18.2_amd64.deb is what I found suggested via google, but couldn't find that package. Found linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-3.5.0-18-generic_3.5.0-22.28_amd64.deb | "apt-get install --simulate linux-backports-modules-cw-3.6-3.5.0-18-generic_3.5.0-22.28_amd64.deb"??
[04:24] <dartos> Coded1: low resolution and unity no loading
[04:24] <Coded1> the "buy beer for coded1 foundation" is always open :)
[04:24] <dartos> Coded1: actually in my last try it didn't look like X loaded at all
[04:24] <Coded1> lol
[04:25] <dartos> lol
[04:25] <dartos> I have the "feed my hungry wallet" trust
[04:25] <Coded1> always a good thing to have
[04:25] <Drumroll> I will be right back
[04:25] <dartos> Coded1: if only problems == money
[04:26] <dartos> Coded1: but back to topic. Do you happen to know what to do? Does  that x-swat repo actually work or... idk
[04:26] <kunji> dartos: They do, they just need to be other people's problems :P
[04:26] <dartos> kunji: lol... thats true... but then money is spend solving your own problem
[04:27] <Coded1> sudo apt-get install --simulate build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-`uname -r`
[04:27] <dartos> kunji: plus you always end up having more problems than others... but with a smaller apartment... makes no sense...
[04:27] <lauratika> dartos: sorry... didnt read your. is a epson nx130... it works fine is just to chek ink levels
[04:27] <dartos> Coded1: ill give it a shot
[04:28] <Tdog676> how do i download a c complier for ubuntu?
[04:28] <dartos> lauratika: check epson's site to see if they have drivers for linux
[04:28] <Coded1> dartos: sorry that was for someone else
[04:28] <dartos> Tdog676: sudo apt-get install gcc
[04:28] <dartos> Coded1: oh okat :(
[04:28] <Tdog676> tks dartos
[04:28] <dartos> Tdog676: np
[04:28] <kunji> dartos: I thought gcc was included?  just not g++?
[04:28] <dartos> Tdog676: I think that also gives you a debugger
[04:28] <dartos> kunji: It wasn't in fedora... idk if it is here
[04:29] <Coded1> dartos: try "sudo lsmod | grep nvidia"
[04:29] <dartos> Coded1: nothing
[04:29] <dartos> btw what is the difference between su and sudo?
[04:29] <Coded1> dartos: try "sudo lsmod | grep nouveau"
[04:30] <dartos> Coded1: yeah things... I know thats the driver i'm on now. It works fine... just not for steam :(
[04:30] <kunji> dartos: I have it, and I know I haven't installed it
[04:30] <dartos> kunji: have what?
[04:30] <kunji> dartos: gcc
[04:31] <Coded1> dartos: k, try "sudo apt-get remove --purge nouveau"
[04:31] <dartos> kunji: ah... I like gcc when I have an IDE to go with it
[04:31] <dartos> Coded1: WHY? that is the only thing keeping my video alive
[04:31] <Coded1> dartos: lol, that's also keeping your nvidia drivers from loading... try "apt-get install jockey-gtk"
[04:32] <kunji> dartos: I actually don't know of any C or C++ IDE that I like, I do like some syntax highlighting though, so I usually use gedit.
[04:32] <dartos> kunji: codeblocks is nice
[04:32] <dartos> kunji: small and functional
[04:32] <dartos> kunji: also someone started maintaining devc++ again... i never liked it though... then there is emacs :D
[04:32] <dartos> Coded1: no package nouveau
[04:33] <kunji> dartos: yuck, yuck, and yuck, to each his own though.
[04:33] <dartos> kunji: i have become dependent on auto-complete
[04:33] <Coded1> dartos: did you install 'jockey-gtk' ?
[04:33] <dartos> kunji: I havn't really used C++ for much besides Qt as of late. I have been loving haxe and monogame... I usually only make games though
[04:33] <dartos> Coded1: downloading
[04:34] <Coded1> k
[04:34] <dartos> Coded1: actually I tried jockey on another intall of 12.10 (this is the 3rd one) and it failed at the driver install
[04:34] <Techeavy> Has anyone installed ubuntu 13?
[04:34] <dartos> Coded1: and from what I have seen it failed on all 12.10...

[04:35] <becom33> is there a way to link in android to keep a log of the installed applications in my machine and reinstall them automatically after I reinstall ubuntu ?
[04:35] <becom33> like in android *
[04:35] <dartos> Coded1: I installed it.. but when I run jockey-gtk it doesn't run... strange

[04:41] <dartos> Coded1: they have a built in jockey now 0.o
[04:41] <dartos> sir you are amazing
[04:41] <fas> After a reboot, I log in via ssh
[04:41] <gskellig> aha! i fixed it
[04:41] <gskellig> still have nvidia problem though
[04:41] <gskellig> can anyone help me with bumblebee?
[04:41] <dartos> Coded1: applying changes... lets see if this fixes it

[04:43] <sulit> hello
[04:43] <sulit> everyone
[04:43] <dartos> I am going to try restarting lightdm... for teh lulz
[04:43] <sulit> o,yeah
[04:43] <dartos> 80% sure thats a bad idea
[04:43] <Maxx__> Hello
[04:43] <sulit> I want to use it
[04:45] <Coded1> dartos: your best off rebooting
[04:45] <Maxx__> I'm using 12.04 and cannot get past the login screen.
[04:45] <dartos> Coded1: yeah i see that
[04:45] <Coded1> proprietary drivers are fickle beasts
[04:45] <fas> Maxx__: what's it saying is wrong?
[04:45] <dartos> Maxx__: did you type in your password?
[04:45] <Maxx__> Yes, I did.
[04:45] <dartos> Maxx__: was it the right one?
[04:46] <dartos> Maxx__: you are not giving us much to work with here... sorry
[04:46] <dartos> Coded1: X didn't start
[04:46] <Maxx__> Yes.  When I tried typing the wrong one, it simply highlighted the box and allowed me to re-enter the password. When I enter the right one, it goes off the login screen for a second then comes right back
[04:47] <kunji> fas: Have you checked that all is as it should be in /etc/ssh/sshd_config?  Also you can run ssh more verbosely to figure out exactly what is happening.
[04:47] <dartos> Coded1: I need to manually startx... and it doesn't look like unity is starting either
[04:47] <fas> kunji: thanks for answering, I just looked at it and nothing seems different
[04:47] <dartos> -_- if conical keeps messing ubuntu up like this people will never switch
[04:48] <fas> kunji: when I log in via ssh, it asks for my username, then I give it and I have the pubkey auth. Then I get a terminal but it's not normal
[04:48] <fas> I use oh-my-zsh but I just get normal zsh
[04:48] <fas> Also, cd brings me to what seems like a guest acount's hime
[04:48] <Coded1> check your /etc/X11/xorg.conf  look for device
[04:48] <fas> kunji: does that make sense?
[04:49] <Coded1> dartos: you should see a "Driver" listing under "Device"
[04:49] <fas> Then, I type 'su myuser' and I get oh-my-zsh back and cd brings me to the right directory
[04:49] <dartos> Coded1: okay ill check
[04:49] <dartos> Coded1: no xorg.conf
[04:50] <kunji> fas: Hmm, I think I know what you're saying, but it's not behavior I've ever seen before.  Maybe the BASH environment is wrong?
[04:50] <dartos> just xorg.conf.failsafe
[04:50] <dartos> and that says the driver is not vesa
[04:50] <dartos> now*
[04:50] <Coded1> dartos: cool, try "sudo nvidia-xconfig"
[04:51] <Coded1> then "startx"
[04:51] <dartos> okay
[04:51] <ThePhoenix> Looking for a good media converter… Anyone have any suggestions?

[04:51] <fas> I have my user set up to use zsh through /etc/passwd
[04:52] <dartos> Coded1: random reboot?
[04:52] <Coded1> ThePhoenix: check out "gstreamer gui" on google
[04:52] <kunji> ThePhoenix: ffmpeg, vlc, mplayer, though the later two may use ffmpeg underneath, not sure.  ffmpeg will take some learning to use correctly, but it's by far the most powerful media converter I've seen.
[04:52] <giggazilla> I was able to boot into initramfs and run some dmraid commands to see the mappers still listed under /dev
[04:52] <ThePhoenix> Didn't know vlc did converting as well as playing
[04:52] <Coded1> dartos: what command made it reboot?
[04:52] <giggazilla> Plus blkid returns the path to all the partitions I had defined previously
[04:52] <ThePhoenix> will check out those various suggestions, thanks
[04:53] <dartos> Coded1: it just kinda did... but it was a normal reboot so...
[04:53] <Coded1> dartos: see what happens when it comes back up
[04:53] <kunji> fas: I'm not sure, I don't mess with mine, sorry I couldn't be more help.  I would recommend running the ssh daemon with -v or whatever it is for verbose, maybe -vvv?  Then it will give you a lot more output and there may be some indication in all of that of what is happening.
[04:53] <dartos> Coded1: x didn't start by itself
[04:53] <dartos> I started X and still see no unity
[04:54] <fas> kunji: I'm accessing it via putty
[04:54] <dartos> Coded1: nvidia's xorg is still there
[04:54] <fas> is that something I set on the server side?
[04:54] <disco-eel> did you look at the lightdm logfile yet?
[04:54] <dartos> Coded1: oh yay system problem detected -_-
[04:54] <disco-eel> theres always juicy stuff in there
[04:55] <dartos> I am looking at the details... and something with Xorg...
[04:55] <Maxx__> Gotta love those system problem detected(s)
[04:55] <dartos> Maxx__: ikr
[04:55] <disco-eel> Its samba giving me mine
[04:55] <Coded1> dartos: pastebin
[04:55] <giggazilla> Anyone?
[04:55] <dartos> Coded1: idk if I can...
[04:55] <Coded1> dartos: which nvidia card do you have?
[04:56] <disco-eel> I havent checked why casue im lazy
[04:56] <dartos> Coded1: GTX 560Ti
[04:56] <dartos> Coded1: crysis 2 edition ;)
[04:56] <kunji> fas: That's fine, yeah, you would set it on the server side.  I don't want to accidentally lock you out of your server, but i think something like sudo service ssh stop && sudo service ssh start -v  will run both commands and then you can just connect again, you should confirm that with someone else before trying it though.  I'm not sure about the -v when calling it through upstart.
[04:57] <Coded1> dartos: do you see anything with "EE" in the error log?
[04:57] <dartos> Was there ever an ubuntu version Linaro?
[04:57] <fas> thanks for your help
[04:57] <fas> I'll look into that
[04:57] <fas> I have physical access if anything goes haywire anyways
[04:57] <dartos> Coded1: where would I look?
[04:58] <dartos> Coded1: it is like a whole system log
[04:58] <disco-eel> Why do I hear sometimes that modprobe.conf is depreciated? The man page doesn't seem to say so
[04:58] <dartos> Coded1: the actual error was
[04:58] <Maxx__> Well. I guess I will tackle my problem anew tomorrow.  Thanks everyone.
[04:58] <fas> kunji: odd. I didn't get kicked out of my connection
[04:59] <fas> is it ssh or ssh server? or openssh?
[04:59] <disco-eel> where should I be configuring my modules?
[04:59] <fas> It told me it stopped and restarted
[04:59] <Coded1> dartos: can you try "dmesg | pastebinit && cat /etc/var/log/Xorg.0.log | pastebinit"?
[04:59] <dartos> Coded1: It's too big
[04:59] <dartos> wait I have an idea... let me try something
[05:01] <kunji> fas: Actually it should be that smooth if all is well.  ssh-server should be the package for openssh I think.  I'm not sure about the -v when running it as a daemon though, using the debug modes is probably better, this should help: http://fixunix.com/mandrake/122505-run-sshd-debugging-mode.html
[05:03] <giggazilla> Ok, well I guess the first step is to boot from the ubuntu livecd
[05:03] <dartos> Coded1: I don't thiknk trying the experimental ones is a good idea...
[05:04] <dartos> btw does anyone know if you can get an ubuntu thinkpad in the USA?
[05:05] <disco-eel> sure, why not?
[05:05] <fas> kunji: it appears it's logging me in as root
[05:05] <dartos> disco-eel: no I mean buy one with ubuntu already on it
[05:05] <disco-eel> right
[05:06] <Coded1> I've personally used the 310 drivers and they work pretty good, It may be a good idea however to try one of the other drivers first and switch
[05:06] <disco-eel> hmm
[05:06] <fas> kunji: which is odd since that's disallowed in my confg
[05:06] <dartos> disco-eel: they sell those in the UK but I don't see any on their US site
[05:06] <dartos> Coded1: okay
[05:06] <disco-eel> best to call I say
[05:06] <dartos> Coded1: trying the nvidia-current instead of nvidia-current-updates
[05:06] <kunji> fas: That's not good at all, I thought that wasn't allowed in the default sshd_config, ... that could be really bad then.
[05:06] <dartos> disco-eel: probably... but that means interactions with... humans....
[05:06] <chriys> my server won't work even in local. The server is running and error.log shows this caught SIGTERM, shutting down

[05:07]  * dartos makes a face of disgust 
[05:07] <disco-eel> yeah I understand

[05:07] <kunji> coolspot: That is highly dependent on your hardware as far as I know
[05:08] <Coded1> dartos: what happened?
[05:08] <coolspot> kunji: Worked in previous releases, so hardware is not at fault.
[05:08] <dartos> Coded1: same thing
[05:08] <kunji> coolspot: It should work then, maybe you're using a different driver or something?
[05:08] <dartos> Coded1: going to try the 310 i guess...
[05:08] <chriys> :x sorry guys little mistake here is the message: my server won't work even in local. The server is running and error.log shows this caught SIGTERM, shutting down  and also child process 24148 still did not exit, sending a SIGTERM
[05:09] <trkmstrwggy> whats up guys
[05:09] <fas> kunji, https://gist.github.com/4680390
[05:09] <coolspot> kunji: No, just vanilla. WPA and related are greyed out for whatever reason, same in other distros based on 12.04.

[05:10] <disco-eel> I was shocked...
[05:10] <drumroll> I need help installing a package containing network drivers on my computer that has no internet
[05:10] <drumroll> I'm not having much luck with google
[05:11] <disco-eel> usb key?
[05:11] <drumroll> do I need apt-offline installed on the destination pc?
[05:11] <drumroll> I do have a USB key
[05:11] <disco-eel> did you find your chipset yet?
[05:11] <drumroll> just not sure how to get packages onto it, including dependencies, and then install them on dest. pc
[05:11] <drumroll> My chipset is atheros 8161
[05:11] <Coded1> dartos: I'm running 13.04 I have 3.8.0-2-generic
[05:11] <fas> kunji, the end of that file is from today
[05:11] <drumroll> I found a package with the driver but it said "dependency is not satisfiable"
[05:12] <dartos> Coded1: is 13.04 more stable then 12.10... I have had NOTHING but problems with 12.10... these damn drivers
[05:12] <drumroll> "dependency is not satisfiable: linux-image-3.5.0-18-generic
[05:12] <coolspot> kunji: "Create New Wireless Network", and "nm-connection-editor" and wherever. Do you have such hardware and if so could you see if they are greyed out for you too?
[05:12] <disco-eel> hmm
[05:12] <dartos> I am thinking of just reinstaling 12.04...
[05:12] <drumroll> would 13.04 have the drivers I need?
[05:13] <drumroll> I didn't realize there was a 13.04 already
[05:13] <Coded1> dartos: not a chance buddy.  I'm having stuff crash all day long.  Luckily I have an SSD :)  It makes the error reporting much faster
[05:13] <dartos> Coded1: ug...
[05:13] <Coded1> just upgrading crashes things
[05:13] <fas> kunji: specifically line 2000+
[05:13] <Coded1> dartos: sometimes it makes it easier installing from scratch and following the step by steps right from the start
[05:13] <dartos> Coded1: if only i could curse in this channel.... I am really mad right now... it didn;t work... again
[05:14] <dartos> Coded1: that would be litterally the 12 time I did that

[05:14] <disco-eel> was it alx?
[05:14] <dartos> Coded1: wait... WAIT
[05:15] <kunji> coolspot: I think my card is a different one, just to be clear you mean in the Security dropdown menu?  WPA & WPA2 Personal and WPA & WPA2 Enterprise are both options for me.
[05:15] <freestylesno> im trying to figure out what i need to do to dual boot on a laptop that came with win8
[05:15] <Coded1> drumroll: try "sudo apt-get install --simulate build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-`uname -r`" and download all the packages separately
[05:16] <dartos> Coded1: IT SEEMS to be working... unity started up and the 310 driver is still selected in software sources
[05:16] <dartos> I am going to run a benchmark to check

[05:18] <Coded1> dartos: your success is a gift on its own buddy
[05:18] <disco-eel> did you already look at that?
[05:18] <kunji> coolspot: Hmm, those aren't grayed out for me.  That's not how I usually create a hotspot though myself, I usually use a much more manual method.  I never had much success with those actually working through the GUI, despite that all the options are available.
[05:18] <dartos> Coded1: well lets see i didn't run the benchmark yet...
[05:18] <coolspot> kunji: You're on 12.04, right? Not 12.10.
[05:20] <kunji> fas: It looks like it changes your identity after checking the blacklist?  Check if you're on the blacklist, also do confirm that sshd_config has root login disabled, just so that is absolutely for sure.
[05:20] <Coded1> dartos: well unity loading is a good sign
[05:20] <juniour> coolspt ubuntu provide wep for hotspot
[05:20] <TheLordOfTime> anyone know of anything like landscape, but absolutely free, so i can manage an entire net of systems?
[05:20] <dartos> that it is
[05:20] <kunji> coolspot: It is working on a 12.04 machine and two 12.10 machines here.
[05:20] <fas> kunji: it has it disabled
[05:20] <coolspot> juniour: Yes, WEP is available but not WPA* which used to be available.
[05:21] <drumroll> it's not that those instructions don't work
[05:21] <kunji> TheLordOfTime: Umm, I don't know what landscape does, but Nagios is a good way to do some server monitoring.
[05:21] <drumroll> it's just that the destination pc does not have internet
[05:21] <drumroll> I'm downloading network driver packages
[05:21] <giggazilla> How can you tell the live cd to stop trying to locate harddisks and just load the live cd?
[05:21] <coolspot> kunji: Just to make sure, you're trying hotspot/adhoc and not regular connection?
[05:21] <juniour> coolspot i never seen wpa
[05:21] <TheLordOfTime> kunji:  i'm aware of nagios for montioring, but i need remote management as well... perhaps i should just ask in -server :/
[05:21] <fas> kunji: also, I don't have anything blacklisted.
[05:21] <juniour> coolspot when i turned hotspot its wep ony
[05:21] <drumroll> So I need to get the packages from "sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.4-precise-generic
[05:22] <drumroll> and put them via usb to another pc
[05:22] <giggazilla> Is there a certain key I can press or something?
[05:22] <coolspot> juniour: Yes, older versions had it available, which is what I want. Which is why I'm trying to figure out why it's disabled and how to enable it again.
[05:22] <disco-eel> yeah
[05:23] <dartos> Coded1: the haven benchmark is beautiful
[05:23] <Coded1> dartos: congrats
[05:23] <dartos> Coded1: especially at 60 FPS
[05:23] <disco-eel> that page was just one of the things that came up
[05:23] <drumroll> where does apt-get install --download-only put the packages?
[05:23] <adamshumpisxxx> Does anyone know how to configure the Xbox 360 controller driver dead zone?
[05:23] <dartos> Coded1: sir... I can't thank you enough
[05:23] <Coded1> dartos: no problems buddy have at er
[05:24] <juniour> ohhh
[05:24] <dartos> Coded1: ...just...just...thank so much
[05:24] <kunji> coolspot: Ah, I see what you mean now, I still have WPA & WPA2 Personal though, The Enterprise one is grayed out though, as is LEAP and Dynamic WEP.  Anyway, is it actually important that this be reproduce on my system?  Especially considering that we don't have the same hardware...
[05:24]  * dartos bursts into tears

[05:25] <dartos> lol
[05:25] <dartos> Coded1: you don't understand what this means
[05:25] <juniour> kunji i dont think its hardware issue
=== Dude is now known as Guest2389
[05:25] <coolspot> kunji: Well, others are having the same issue with hardware I don't have. What WiFi cards do you have? And you don't have to enable any hotspot, just check if the things are greyed out or not, which they are for me and others.

[05:26] <disco-eel> does anyone understand what I mean about the modules?
[05:26] <juniour> kunji the same hard ware provide wep.wpa * in windows os but in ubuntu it provides wep ony

[05:26] <Coded1> lol
[05:26] <dr_willis> giggazilla:  in not sure we are clear on the question.
[05:26] <juniour> so  i think its not the hard ware issue

[05:27] <disco-eel> well Im just a bit confused on where I should pass options for my modules
[05:27] <kunji> coolspot: Right I did check, my card is an Atheros AR9300.  You could try using hostapd for this, it's what I usually use for this kind of thing, this could help getting started with it: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/debian-ubuntu-linux-setting-wireless-access-point/

[05:28] <disco-eel> ls /etc/modprobe.d/
[05:28] <disco-eel> oops
[05:28] <kunji> Coded1: Wayland... well, we'll see how that actually goes over.
[05:28] <Coded1> dartos: it's a sweet idea, check it out on youtube
[05:29] <Coded1> think of a 3D game where all the surfaces are your desktop
[05:29] <kunji> Coded1: Did they ever find a way to reincorporate network transparency?
[05:29] <adamshumpisxxx> Does anyone know how to configure the Xbox 360 controller driver dead zone?
[05:29] <drumroll> dr_willis thank you that is where the packages downloaded
[05:29] <Coded1> kunji: network transparency?
[05:30] <dartos> Coded1: it looks like compiz...
[05:30] <coolspot> kunji: I also have "AR9300", which is a generic name for these models, the specific card I have is AR9382, you might have the same or AR9380, I think. So you're not using any other software to have WPA available as an option for hotspot?
[05:30] <Dr_Physicist> dr_willis: Thank you for the answer. Just one more thing. Does not any kind of problem?
[05:31] <dr_willis> Dr_Physicist:  theres alwyas potential for problems..
[05:31] <fas> kunji: I think I figured it out
[05:31] <kunji> Coded1: Well, that's just the thing right, X is actually a server and can send to clients, it lets us do neat things like using the -X option with ssh.  Also it lets you do things like run many end terminals on the same server, whatever they're calling that these days.
[05:32] <kunji> fas: What did you find?  I've been looking at the log, but I haven't figured anything out yet T.T
[05:32] <Coded1> kunji: ahh you mean wayland remote "X" sessions
[05:32] <giggazilla> dr_willis: the live cd hangs and when I esc out of the graphic it keeps trying to discover /dev/sda...b... etc
[05:32] <fas> kunji: I installed xwindows the other day, when logging in via ssh and if I do 'cd' and then 'ls' I get a .desktop file and a README
[05:32] <kunji> Coded1: So they did end up doing it?
=== ke5pcv is now known as ke5pcv-away

[05:33] <chriys> it'S alright i found solution -_-'
[05:33] <chriys> ethernet cable was unplugged
[05:33] <fas> the README says something like, this directory has been unmounted for your safety, use the gui to click the .desktop file or type in *some command*
[05:33] <Coded1> kunji: Wayland basically replaces X
[05:34] <chriys> does somebody can test this website and tell me if it works please http://regroupementjeunesseenaction.com/
[05:34] <chriys> i'm verifying if it works outside of my local network
[05:34] <adamshumpisxxx> That website does not work.
[05:34] <kunji> Coded1: I know, but those functions of X were originally planned to be scrapped in wayland because of difficulties doing it with Wayland's very different architecture.  It's been some time since I looked at the project though, they may have changed their minds.
[05:34] <Coded1> kunji: you could always run X as headless and still have remotes
[05:35] <disco-eel> so for instance, if I want to add support for more loop devices, I set "loop options loop max_loop=64"

[05:35] <threex5> is there a particular version of ubuntu that works better in gnome fallback mode? I'm running 12.10 and it's a little buggy
[05:35] <kunji> Coded1: You mean side by side with wayland?  Hmm, we'll have to see if they play nice, but I would expect some contention between them.
[05:36] <threex5> i would be willing to downgrade if it was worth it.
[05:36] <kunji> threex5: You mean using gnome-panel?
[05:36] <threex5> correct
[05:36] <dr_willis> threex5:  gnome-fallback mode is scheduled for eventual  removal.. but it may have gotten a stay of execution for a few more releases

[05:37] <dr_willis> threex5:  if you like the old skool type desktop. you may want to check out Lubuntu
[05:37] <threex5> dr_willis, I know. this is causing me anxiety.
[05:37] <Dr_Physicist> dr_willis: Yes. Where can I find a tutorial to up the partitions for start of installation?
[05:37] <dr_willis> threex5:  gnome2 is dead... time to move on
[05:37] <threex5> I might try lubuntu again. I really, really like gnome 2 though

[05:37] <threex5> no!
[05:37] <dr_willis> gnome2 has had issues for ages....  people just overlooked them
[05:38] <chriys> adamshumpisxxx seriously ? this is weird
[05:38] <dr_willis> Dr_Physicist:  i just use a gparted live cd normally
[05:38] <threex5> I don't understand why I have to move on from software that works exactly the way I like it, that I've already mastered
[05:38] <adamshumpisxxx> Yes. Seriously.
[05:38] <kunji> fas: Hmm, it doesn't help me, someone else probably would know more than I do though.
[05:38] <threex5> So frustrating. Mate is buggy too
[05:38] <adamshumpisxxx> I would say if you love GNOME2 then use MATE.
[05:38] <dr_willis> threex5:  the gnome devs gave many reasons for moveing  away from gnome2
[05:38] <chriys> can you try to add the www admshumpisxxx
[05:38] <chriys> what is mate ?
[05:38] <coolspot> kunji: Could you provide a quick screenshot of the available WPA options regarding hotspot/adhoc that you see?
[05:39] <threex5> mate is a fork of gnome 2
[05:39] <adamshumpisxxx> But the big problem I have with it is the "Shut Down..." option under System is missing for me.

[05:55] <kunji> coolspot: at the end?  Maybe it's fixed in the 3.5 kernel (I think what 12.10 is using).
[05:55] <coolspot> kunji: And yes, I was looking at that bug report earlier..

[05:56] <dr_willis> learn about them ;)
[05:56] <kunji> coolspot: If that is what the problem is, then the packages aren't going to make a difference and messing with them will just be a waste of time.

[05:57] <coolspot> kunji: What version of Linux did you install? It's not so nice for this to appear in the LTS release..
[05:59] <kunji> coolspot: I did install 12.04, but I'm not using that kernel anymore.  That kernel did not play nice with any of my wireless devices, they would hang and broadcast, effectively jamming the entire wireless band.  It was not pleasant.
[06:00] <drumroll> make worked woo
[06:00] <coolspot> kunji: So, what version of Linux did you install on that 12.04 machine to get WPA available?
[06:01] <fas> Anyone know how to uninstall x? Or at least stop it from logging me into X when logging in via ssh?
[06:01] <dr_willis> !text | fas
[06:01] <ubottu> fas: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[06:01] <kunji> coolspot: I'm using 3.5.0-22 at the moment, the same as what 12.10 is using, the only reason I did that instead of just upgrading to 12.10 was as a learning experience really.
[06:01] <fas> dr_willis: that's not what I want
[06:01] <dr_willis> i dont see how  logging in via ssh.. logs you into X

[06:02] <fas> dr_willis: It logs me in as my user but typing 'cd' doesn't bring me to my home
[06:02] <drumroll_itworke> thanks dr_willis jbud Coded1
[06:02] <coolspot> kunji: Ah, ok. So 12.04 is borked with regards to this. Sad thing on LTS. Well, cheers for the help.
[06:02] <kunji> dr_willis: His .bashrc maybe?  I could be completely off track though
[06:02] <drumroll_itworke> brand new build complete
[06:02] <fas> I then have to do 'su myuser' and then 'cd' to get to my home

[06:03] <drumrolll> thanks Coded1
[06:03] <kunji> coolspot: anytime, yeah, I've actually found 12.10 to work out much better for me in pretty much every regard.
[06:03] <drumrolll> it was a pain
[06:03] <fas> dr_willis: after logging in via ssh I don't get my home, I get a .desktop file and a README, which both look like they pertain to X
[06:03] <drumrolll> I buckled and bought windows for this build too, just for games
[06:03] <drumrolll> windows won't even install
[06:03] <drumrolll> Linux: 1 Windows: 0
[06:03] <fas> dr_willis: does that make sense?
[06:04] <dr_willis> fas  youa re using an encrypted home.. so it makes sence...
[06:04] <dr_willis> its not unencrypting the home when you sssh in
=== drumrolll is now known as drumroll
[06:04] <fas> How do I get it to do that when sshing in?
[06:04] <dr_willis> and what is IN the readme?
[06:04] <dr_willis> I dont use encrypted home.. so no idea...
[06:04] <seeqwell> uptime tells me I have 4 users in my system and I only have one terminal open which one is for me, one is auto assigned to root.  What are the other two and how to I kill the pid please?
[06:04] <fas> It wasn't like this prior to a recent reboot
[06:05] <dr_willis> you may want to check on askubuntu.com for ssh and encrypted home issues
[06:05] <coolspot> kunji: I was looking to use Trisquel 6.0 (Ubuntu 12.04) as a server, also doing this hotspot, so I'd want WPA obviously. But doesn't seem to be the solution. Unless I just use a router on the ethernet port and let that do the wireless bit, but I'd prefer not to do that.
[06:06] <fas> dr_willis: I think I figured it out
[06:06] <fas> thanks for your help
[06:07] <drumroll> how do I update from os
[06:07] <drumroll> from *terminal
[06:07] <kunji> coolspot: It still might work with hostapd, seems like it did for this person: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1835274
[06:07] <dr_willis> sudo apt-get update
[06:07] <drumroll> "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" ?
[06:07] <dr_willis> drumroll:  yes...
[06:07] <billytwowilly> why trisquel?
[06:07] <Coded1> drumroll: yup
[06:07] <drumroll> thx
[06:07] <fas> kunji, dr_willis, prior to reboot I had logged in physically (at my desk) as my user thus whenever sshing in it was already unencrypted. Then after a reboot I didn't log back in so I need to unencrypt home every time I log in.
[06:08] <giggazilla> Looks like I have grep at least so that's plus
[06:08] <coolspot> kunji: That's not regarding 12.04 though?
[06:09] <dr_willis> fas:  makes sence to me.. I dont se emuch point in using encrypted home on my desktop machines
[06:09] <fas> dr_willis: it's a server
[06:09] <fas> but yeah, I did it just for fun
[06:09] <fas> didn't know of any downsides
[06:09] <dr_willis> seen LOTS of people with encrypted issues in here.
[06:10] <dr_willis> ;)
[06:10] <kunji> coolspot: Ah, you're right, my bad.  Not sure why I thought it was.
[06:10] <fas> haha good, not just me
[06:10] <dr_willis> unless its on a laptop and you have critical stuff you dont want to get stolen.
[06:10] <dr_willis> i dont see much point.
[06:10] <dr_willis> bbl
[06:10] <fas> dr_willis: unfortunately it's a pain to stop home encryption

[06:25] <kunji> coolspot: Hmm, that looks good, but as they say, they need the kernel changes, otherwise it will actually be creating an unsecured network.  That probably means the option on my 12.04 install actually creates an unsecured network though -_- good thing I wasn't using it.

[06:38] <pen9u1n> is it safe to remove a partition with parted, and add it again, and the partition still mount able?
[06:38] <xrs> sure but any data on the partition will be gone
[06:38] <pen9u1n> why? I will do nothing on that area
[06:38] <vbgunz> anyone here pretty familiar with the quirks of ssh? I have a private key that can log into a host over lan without a problem *but* using the exact same key, going over the internet through the public ip, connects to the same exact RSA verified host but my private key does not get accepted and neither does my password.
[06:38] <pen9u1n> actually i want to resize a part
[06:38] <aeon-ltd> pen9u1n: if you are mounting it like /dev/sdx/ and the x is the same
[06:39] <vbgunz> none of these problems exist if I connect over lan, but over the internet, the key fails and so does the password
[06:39] <vbgunz> does anyone know what I can look into for fixing this?
[06:40] <xrs> could be your router is not forwarding
[06:40] <aeon-ltd> vbgunz: if you have a firewall restriction that only allows connections over lan that could be it
[06:40] <xrs> have you set up port forwarding for SSH on the router? no firewall restrictions that conflict?
[06:41] <vbgunz> it is and should be forwarding, I connect to the same RSA host, it checks the private key and fails then prompts for a password and that fails too
[06:43] <RiXtEr> How can I remove a directory when there is so many files in it I can't even do a ls in it? (I have done rm -fr /path/to/directory, but it ran for about 10 hours, any my cpu load was cruising about 8 )
[06:43] <aeon-ltd> RiXtEr: how did you get so many files>
[06:43] <aeon-ltd> ?
[06:43] <RiXtEr> I think a bug in another program.
[06:44] <hillary> anybody with a remedy to my problem?
[06:44] <aeon-ltd> RiXtEr: if the progam's running then it could be generating faster than you can rm
[06:44] <xrs> vbgunz,  there is also #ssh and #openssh
[06:44] <RiXtEr> aeon-ltd, hrm, I doubt it, but I will give it a shot.
[06:45] <aeon-ltd> RiXtEr: if it is, try booting to a livecd then managing the files there
[06:45] <RiXtEr> well, I can end the program, but it doesn't seem that is the issue.
[06:45] <RiXtEr> aeon-ltd, I ran rm with the program down for about 10 mins and the folder size never changes
[06:46] <aeon-ltd> RiXtEr: do you own all the files?
[06:46] <RiXtEr> aeon-ltd, the problem is I don't even know how many files are in this folder, but most are 0k
[06:46] <RiXtEr> aeon-ltd, running this as root.
[06:46] <aeon-ltd> ah
[06:46] <RiXtEr> aeon-ltd, the only reason I noticed it at all, is that I ran out of inodes.

[06:52] <litropy> Hi, all - I'm running stock 12.04; I have no sound. I guess I'd like to start with pulling my soundcard info, which I need help with, and also seeing if it's properly active, which I also need help with. But, if you guys have a better idea, I'm all ears.
[06:52] <litropy> This is the first time I've tested sound on this box, btw.
[06:52] <CHIex> hello, I am choosing Linux distribution.. I am new Linux user, is UBUNTU user friendly?  is it hard to install software?
[06:52] <litropy> Although it's been operating fine in all other respects for months.
[06:53] <cfhowlett> CHIex, yes it's user friendly.  software install is easy.
[06:53] <kunji> RiXtEr: dd can't ignore just a file, it doesn't have a concept of filesystems, only of block level devices.
[06:53] <litropy> CHIex, Ubuntu is just about the friendliest linux distro you'll find.
[06:53] <abdullah> hello
[06:53] <RiXtEr> kunji, I know, I was just hopeful ;)
[06:53] <kunji> CHIex: what litropy said, and installing most software is very easy
[06:54] <cfhowlett> abdullah, greetings
[06:54] <abdullah> is there a good beginners for mono ?
[06:54] <kunji> RiXtEr: Are you just trying to get rid of the folder?
[06:54] <RiXtEr> kunji, yep
[06:55] <abdullah> cfhowlett thank you
[06:55] <RiXtEr> kunji, I have had rm -fr /path/to/folder running for about 10 hours, and ls -alhd reports the same size as 10 hours ago, 473 mb
[06:55] <cfhowlett> abdullah, what's your ubuntu question??
[06:55] <RiXtEr> err... 443 mb
[06:56] <litropy> CHIex, you're also in just the right place, for here is where your questions will be answered most effectively. You can count on this channel being active nearly 24 hours a day, into the foreseeable future.
[06:57] <abdullah> sorry it is my mistake :) i loged in both mono and ubuntu chanel sory for that guys
[06:57] <litropy> CHIex, just keep in mind, your questions may not be answered immediately. Case in point: my sound question up there.
[06:57] <RiXtEr> litropy, first check, double check, and check again if the card is just muted, then from a terminal run lspci (assuming its a pci card) and look for your sound card, then hop on google and see what module it uses and check to see if its loaded with lsmod
[06:57] <cfhowlett> abdullah, no worries
[06:57] <litropy> Yay, RiXtEr. Reading and executing.
[06:58] <kunji> RiXtEr: That's really strange, I thought that would have deleted in seconds.
[06:59] <RiXtEr> kunji, what I can tell you is I was at 100% inode usage (df -i) and now I am at 11%
[06:59] <RiXtEr> /dev/sda1            16138240 1679125 14459115   11% /
[07:00] <RiXtEr> kunji, and if what I read was right, 1 file takes 1 inode, so I cleared 14459115 files already.
[07:01] <RiXtEr> kunji, and gaining...
[07:01] <RiXtEr> 14466615 in just the amount of time we talked..
[07:01] <kunji> RiXtEr: Hmm, I don't know what to think of that, I've never seen something like that.  I guess I've heard of an attack or two designed to fill a disk, but I've never seen it happen.
[07:02] <RiXtEr> kunji, this is either a samba or cups bug, its a print spooler directory.
[07:02] <RiXtEr> kunji, which I know some of the samba devs personally, so I will hit them up first.
[07:02] <RiXtEr> (I know just last week they revamped a lot of the printing code)
=== drumroll_ is now known as drumroll
=== alejandro is now known as Guest22953
[07:04] <kunji> RiXtEr: Isn't the print spool a notorious attack vector on windows?  Or am I getting mixed up with something else?  It certainly could be a bug, not something I've seen before, but yeah, those could certainly be involved, the devs will know much more than I do ^_^
[07:04] <RiXtEr> kunji, by my math, if I have killed of 90% in 10 hours, then the next 10% should only take maybe 1 more hour ;)
[07:04] <kunji> RiXtEr: When it gets down to 5% it will trigger a regen :P
[07:05] <RiXtEr> kunji, not funny.

[07:21] <cfhowlett> purplerain, could be hardware or software.  Are you dualbooting?  Is it only ubuntu failing to boot?   Is there any other off-key behavior you've noticed?
[07:21] <kunji> purplerain: a good first place to check is /var/log/syslog, also /var/log/xorg.0.log
[07:21] <cfhowlett> purplerain, did it free altogether or what?
[07:22] <kunji> purplerain: After bios screen, but before GRUB2?

[07:22] <purplerain> kunji: after GRUB2
[07:23] <kunji> purplerain: Mmmk, does the OS start to load, if so, then I would expect some useful info in the syslog
[07:24] <kunji> purplerain: Unfortunately I'm no expert, but post the syslog and any xorg logs in /var/log and it will help others to help you.
[07:25] <kunji> purplerain: Also maybe dmesg and the kernel log, though I think problems there are less common.

[08:04] <fas> WhiteRook: both
[08:04] <fas> Successfully
[08:04] <hillary> when i click on libreoffice writer it opens terminal window. whats up?

Also it sounds like an update fixed that problem: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/hplip/+bug/335662  Have you tried updating?  Your problem might be with a different application?
[08:05] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 335662 in HPLIP "[jaunty] hplip status service cannot find system tray" [Undecided,Fix committed]
[08:05] <gnomefreak> anyone remember the command to adjust update alternatives?
[08:05] <WhiteRook> I am trying to avoid losing my current install of Win8 (dont have files to reinstall programs) but dont know whether I would be better off dual booting or using VM to run Ubuntu
[08:05] <dysun> Hi all. I installed GNS3 from source doing the make/make install. i was wondering how I can figure out where the program is located
[08:05] <kunji> WhiteRook: Yes indeed, though not using gpt if that's what your setup is.
[08:06] <subdesign> kunji, i installed yesterday latest hp driver, and have the prob so..
[08:06] <fas> dysun: most likely in that directory
[08:06] <fas> idk GNS3 though
[08:06] <fas> just a guess
[08:06] <opalepatrick> I keep moaning about this. unity 12.10 64bit - Every boot up, the hud and launcher are behind all the startup programmes or any that I open. Have logout/in to fix. Any clues what may cause this?
[08:06] <fas> if you didn't add it to your bin/ you won't beable to just call it from command line
[08:06] <hillary> kunji, Help me my ubuntu 12.04 messing me up. when i click libreoffice writer it opens terminal window instead
[08:07] <kunji> WhiteRook: I like to dualboot for the better performance, but you would need to be careful doing the formatting.  A virtual machines is the most fool proof way to keep windows running as normal.
[08:07] <fas> Wubi is pretty good, but kinda slow
[08:07] <fas> Dual booting is pretty sure-fire
[08:08]  * gnomefreak cant reproduce that issue hillary  sorry not much help
[08:08] <dysun> fas: Is there a way to find it? It's been a while since installed the thing. If I do the apt-get install GNS3, it runs an older version f GNS3. I wanted a newer version so i compiled it all from source. If i have the apt-get install instance of GNS3 and i run gns3, it runs the older one, but if I remove it, ti'll run the one i compiled.
[08:08] <fas> If you make a backup of win8 first you should be safe
[08:08] <subdesign> kunji, the bug you pasted, comment #10, where to find this code line?
[08:08] <kunji> fas: Wubi isn't really slow, Wubi installs are also not virtual machines.
[08:09] <fas> kunji: my experience has been noticeably slower, but better than VM
[08:09] <fas> wubi is sightly better at keeping win8 in tact though compared to dual booting
[08:09] <WhiteRook> I want to go ahead and repartition now just in case, any suggestions on how much space on my primary HDD to allocate for use in the event I dual boot? Including swap and any other partitions i may need, total size?
[08:09] <fas> dysun: sorry, someone else might know
[08:09] <phoenixsampras> what is wubi?
[08:10] <fas> WhiteRook: how much physical ram
[08:10] <WhiteRook> Wubi is a loader for windows systems i think
[08:10] <somsip> !wubi | phoenixsampras
[08:10] <ubottu> phoenixsampras: Wubi is an Ubuntu installer for Windows users that allows you to install and uninstall Ubuntu like a Windows application, in a simple and safe way. http://wubi-installer.org/support.php and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide for troubleshooting. Please  file bugs at http://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug. For Ubuntu Oneiric/11.10 http://releases.ubuntu.com/oneiric/wubi.exe
[08:10] <hillary> i should embark on serious reading of ubuntu linux. where are the best easy to learn materials
[08:10] <WhiteRook> 8GB physical
[08:10] <dysun> fas: ok. the question i guess is really more about where software packages go
[08:10] <fas> hillary: the main site
[08:10] <dysun> fas: thanks though
[08:10] <kunji> fas: Yeah, that's what I mean, it is somewhat slower than a native install, but I find it vastly faster than in a virtual machine, but that's probably less noticeable on systems where you can devote more resources to the VM.
[08:10] <fas> kunji: yup. I still prefer dual boot to Wubi though
[08:10] <hillary> fas, link
[08:11] <fas> ubuntu.com
[08:11] <phoenixsampras> oh thanks!!
[08:11] <fas> There is a LOT of documentation
[08:11] <somsip> hillary: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/an-absolute-ubuntu-beginners-guide.html
[08:11] <fas> WhiteRook: you probably don't need much swap
[08:11] <fas> how big of a hdd
[08:11] <fas> and how much do you have used by win8?
[08:11] <WhiteRook> 1TB
[08:12] <WhiteRook> i have 150GB used
[08:12] <hillary> somsip, Thanks
[08:12] <fas> I'd give 8gb swap (even though it's still overkill
[08:12] <fas> Then at least 30gb for the main partition since you can afford
[08:12] <fas> But of course, you can use as much as you want
[08:12] <dysun> fas: nvm i figured it out. /usr/local/src is where i put the source. /usr/local/bin is where the 'gns3' command is found
[08:13] <fas> Personally I have a 512gb ssd and have it split down the middle
[08:13] <kunji> WhiteRook: You only really need a root partition (/) and the swap partition (/swap), I would make swap the size of your RAM unless you have a lot.  / I would probably drop between 100 and 200 gigs on if my drive is that size, but you could install with as little as 5... I would use a minimum of 30
[08:13] <WhiteRook> Yeah i was thinking of freeing up about 100GB as unalocated (to be divided on partitions for ubuntu, swap, and another OS)
[08:13] <fas> dysun: I figured it'd be there, but I wasn't confident. :)
[08:14] <fas> If you're going to do a third, I would have more than 100
[08:14] <fas> You don't want to keep on repartitioning to prevent screwing something up
[08:14] <kunji> subdesign: You say you installed the latest driver?  Maybe put back the old one, I'm guess this new driver wasn't in the repos was it?
[08:14] <fas> WhiteRook: I mean, you don't want to keep on resizing partitions
[08:14] <subdesign> kunji, no
[08:14] <fas> I'd suggest taking at least 150gb from your win8
[08:15] <subdesign> i downloaded the latest deb package
[08:15] <fas> then split that into ubuntu and leave some unallocated for your third
[08:15] <kunji> WhiteRook: Yeah, better not to keep resizing if you don't need to, though personally I've never had gparted screw up, it's better not to chance it.
[08:15] <fas> Easier to add unallocated to already existing partitions then resizing existing ones with data
[08:15] <fas> I've never had gparted screw up either, but yeah, it has been known to happen
[08:16] <WhiteRook> no i just plan on leaving some of the 100 as unalocated for 3rd i meant
[08:16] <fas> That's why backing up is always a good idea
[08:16] <fas> WhiteRook: if you think 100 is enough for two whole OSs.
[08:16] <fas> You Do have a 1tb drive. ;)
[08:16] <fas> Up to you of course. 100 will be fine for 2 *nix OSs
[08:16] <kunji> WhiteRook: A heads up, windows likes to complain when it gets resized and will insist on checking the filesystem, sometimes it gets in a bad sort of loop where it checks it on every boot, so try really hard to not resize the windows partition
[08:18] <kunji> Mmk... I need to sleep, only 2 hours last night and it's 3:18 A.M. where I am.
[08:18] <fas> Thanks for earlier kunji
[08:18] <fas> ah balls
[08:18] <WhiteRook> If i were to free up 500GB as unalocated, once I format a partition for ubuntu, would i have issues adding some of the unalocated remaining space to windows parittion if needed? the partitions have to be adjacent dont they?
[08:19] <fas> WhiteRook: probabl not too much of a problem, but windows does complain a bit when resized either direction
[08:19] <fas> Just make sure to back up win8 before doing anything
[08:19] <WhiteRook> haha yeah
[08:21] <WhiteRook> any favorite bootloaders out there that work well for anyone with multi mixed OSs (not all nix OSs)?
[08:21] <fas> I'm running server 12.04, what is the best way to set up a vm? I'm looking at setting up a vm of metasploitable so there won't be any graphics on the VM
[08:21] <fas> WhiteRook: grub is awesome
[08:22] <fas> Should find win8 automatically too
[08:22] <WhiteRook> used grub once awhile back, liked it - didnt know if it has issues on win 8 though
[08:22] <fas> Nope, it's solid
[08:22] <fas> It's what I use
[08:22] <somsip> !info svfb | fas
[08:22] <ubottu> fas: Package svfb does not exist in quantal
[08:22] <somsip> !info Xvfb | fas

[08:23] <fas> somsip: thanks
[08:23] <fas> I'll check it out
[08:23] <fas> I heard of bochs but it sounded like a poor solution
[08:23] <somsip> fas: I use this with a CI server so it may be similar for VMs. I think i've seen search results for VM on a headless server before too
[08:23] <fas> hmm. Ok
[08:24] <iceroot> fas: i am using xen for my headless vms on a server
[08:25] <fas> iceroot: how does xen work?
[08:25] <fas> Is it run in X?
[08:25] <iceroot> !xen | fas
[08:25] <ubottu> fas: XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen
[08:25] <iceroot> fas: no
[08:25] <fas> that sounds pretty good then
[08:26] <iceroot> fas: its directly in the kernel (you need a xen-kernel)
[08:26] <fas> iceroot: thanks
[08:26] <iceroot> hm, no xen-kernel in 12.04?
[08:27] <iceroot> !info xen-hypervisor-amd64
[08:27] <ubottu> Package xen-hypervisor-amd64 does not exist in quantal
[08:27] <subdesign> if I installed drivers this way - http://bit.ly/14ye5ac - how can I remove it?
[08:27] <fas> I think everyone past 11.04 has xen-kernel

[08:28] <iceroot> fas: you could also have a look at kvm
[08:29] <iceroot> !kvm | fas
[08:29] <ubottu> fas: kvm is the preferred virtualization approach in Ubuntu. For more information see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM
[08:29] <fas> god damn it
[08:29] <iceroot> fas: seems like ubuntu os prefering kvm and not xen
[08:29] <fas> just installed xen
[08:29] <fas> lol
[08:31] <iceroot> fas: i am running fine here with xen, so xen is not a bad option but as it seems kvm is the current vm-tech (kernel based) which is getting more support/updates
[08:31] <fas> alright
[08:31] <fas> any way I can roll back this aptitude install?
[08:32] <bono> it's simply the fastest virtualization sw out there
[08:32] <iceroot> fas: apt-get remove packagename
[08:32] <fas> thanks
[08:32] <dr_willis> best to not use aptitude these days.
[08:32] <fas> does that take care of dependencies it installed?
[08:32] <iceroot> !aptitude | fas
[08:32] <ubottu> fas: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[08:32] <iceroot> dr_willis: btw the bug is fixed in 12.10
[08:32] <iceroot> fas: yes
[08:32] <fas> iceroot: thanks
[08:32] <Tensibai> Hi
[08:32] <WhiteRook> ok wtf is 686 architecture
[08:33] <iceroot> fas: but for the dependencies you have to run "sudo apt-get autoremove" after

[08:35] <WhiteRook> i was trying to get ubuntu up on a test in VM and it said only i686 was detected
[08:35] <WhiteRook> CPU virtualization maybe?
[08:35] <WhiteRook> no direct paging access?
[08:35] <iceroot> WhiteRook: you did not enable VT-X in virtualbox
[08:35] <iceroot> WhiteRook: or vmware
[08:36] <iceroot> WhiteRook: or vt-x is not enabled in the bios
[08:36] <WhiteRook> yeah i disabled it because i got a conflict when i tried it first
[08:36] <iceroot> WhiteRook: and how should amd64 work when you disable vt-x?
[08:36] <fas> iceroot: does xen run if my cpu desn't support hardware virtualization?
[08:36] <iceroot> WhiteRook: vt-x is the reason why amd64 is working in vms
[08:36] <iceroot> fas: yes
[08:36] <WhiteRook> yeah i know im tired and not thinking lol
[08:36] <fas> kvm doesn
[08:36] <fas> t
[08:37] <fas> so I guess I'll be going with xen. :P
[08:37] <iceroot> fas: what cpu do you have?
[08:37] <fas> amd, it's old
[08:37] <fas> idk specifics off top of my head
[08:37] <fas> dual core
[08:37] <iceroot> fas: you could have a look at "cat /proc/cpuinfo"
[08:38] <iceroot> fas: but i dont know how it is named on amd cpus, on intel its "vt-x"
[08:38] <iceroot> fas: hm, if that is missing, i dont know if your system can run xen
[08:39] <WhiteRook> intel core i7 should have vt-x
[08:39] <fas> no vt_x and it actually IS intel
[08:39] <iceroot> fas: the manpage is saying its working without vt-x
[08:39] <fas> cool
[08:40] <WhiteRook> when enabling vt-x in VM it tells me its locked (BIOS i assume?)

[08:47] <reiligha> Hi. I'm messing around in an attempt to learn linux, and I'm having trouble with echo. When I echo a - protocol it just echos all the things (IE <echo -e /a Alert!> returns <-e /a Alert!>, annoyingly)
[08:48] <reiligha> Er, sorry, it returns /a Alert!, not the -e
[08:48] <dr_willis> reiligha:  /a is supposed to do a beep? thats normaly disabled by a  a lot of disrtos who blacklist the pcspker module
[08:49] <reiligha> Oh, I didn't know that, I thought I was doing it wrong. I'll try some other /stuff. Thanks!
[08:49] <dr_willis> ive never noticed tbe -e option to echo. ;)
[08:50] <reiligha> dr_willis I'm not sure if it's supposed to beep or what, the manual just says that it does an alert. I was curious as to what that means.
[08:50] <reiligha> dr_willis Also, the manual is very wrong about what typing <echo --help> will do.

[10:17] <Italyne> iceroot,  what you mean see above ?  Where above ?

[11:30] <l057c0d3r> but i have to say... im rather happy with the outcome
[11:31] <l057c0d3r> started with a base lubuntu system..  installed gnome..  changed session to gnome/openbox.  and then run cairo-dock to replace gnome's taskbars ext..  yet keep the gnome classic application menu :-)  and i'm very happy with this setup
[11:32] <l057c0d3r> fixed the issue i was having with the messaging system in cairo-dock as well..
[11:32] <ThinkT510> l057c0d3r: curiosity asks for a screenshot
[11:33] <l057c0d3r> its not completely finished yet.. but i could hook you up...
[11:33] <l057c0d3r> do me a fav  wait like ten seconds and nick alert me again.. i want to see something..  just switched over from xchat to xchat-gnome..  to add it to the messaging menu.. want to see if it works like i think

[11:34] <inhies> is it possible to have a ppa on launchpad that will give the user 64 bit or 32 bit versinos of my package depending on their architecure automatically?

[11:35] <iceroot> inhies: that is the default
[11:35] <inhies> iceroot: cool, im just getting started so i assume one of the guides somewhere will tell me how to do that
[11:35] <inhies> just wanted to check
[11:35] <l057c0d3r> to bad i cant close it to the messaging menu like empathy...  if i close it it closes xchat..  and even if xchat is open if i click on it in the messaging menu it opens a new instance..  but not a big issue
[11:36] <iceroot> inhies: there is nothing special to do
[11:36] <iceroot> inhies: its all provided in the source-package which will tell if it is "all" or not, if it is not all, the buildsystem will create the amd64 and i386 version
[11:37] <l057c0d3r> k well i will take that screenshot and upload it for you really fast
[11:37] <iceroot> inhies: and apt-get/aptitude and so on will fetch the correct architectue version
[11:37] <inhies> iceroot: will my package be distributed as source or wtih a binary? it's written in Golang so i was hoping to provide users with my ppa detail and then they can just isntall the binary

[11:43] <ubottu> Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.

[11:46] <Aknot> I have ubuntu 9.10 on my laptop, what happens if i dont upgrade it? Can i only get programs which are years old?
[11:46] <Ben64> Aknot: no security updates, leaves you potentially open to attack
[11:46] <ThinkT510> Aknot: its not supported anymore
[11:48] <Aknot> But can i get for instance latest firefox from repositories?
[11:48] <l057c0d3r> here you go http://imagebin.org/244917
[11:48] <ThinkT510> Aknot: the repos are no longer available so no
[11:49] <ThinkT510> l057c0d3r: that does look nice
[11:49] <l057c0d3r> and remember..  this is just setup with a tiny bit of work to it..  its no where near complete.. its my start for moving away from the new gnome and unity..  and having something that just works better then lxde
[11:49] <Ben64> Aknot: you should really update, it's not going to get any better
[11:50] <Aknot> <l057c0d3r that looks wonderful, if i install latest ubuntu then gnome how can i get it to look like that?
[11:50] <l057c0d3r> i started off by installing lubuntu..  then from there installed gnome and cairo-dock.
[11:51] <l057c0d3r> then on the login screen..  select gnome/openbox for the session....
[11:51] <roasted> Question - when working with mdadm, is it bad practice to have a file system on your hard drives before adding them to the raid array? I had ext4 on both of my drives before mirroring them, but they seem to work fine (in fact I'm not even sure I set them as a raid f0 or whatever prior, but still the array is running now)
[11:51] <l057c0d3r> after that..  you will have to make cairo-dock autostart with that session..  but for first time to get the cairo-dock to show up...  press ctl-alt-t and type cairo-dock &
[11:52] <Aknot> <l057c0d3r do i also need openbox?
[11:53] <l057c0d3r> openbox comes with lubuntu....  since its an lxde/openbox session by default
[11:53] <l057c0d3r> i believe if you are using ubuntu instead of lubuntu.. you can just install gnome and cairo-dock.. and from the session menu there should be a cario-dock/gnome session as well
[11:54] <CyL> Hi, I'm readind online about setting up a ubuntu box (12.04 LTS) as a LAMP server, and there is this article on how to do it using tasksel, however it is outdated (written for 10.04). I'd like to know if this is still a safe and easy approach.
[11:54] <l057c0d3r> my main reason for using gnome over lxde for this setup.. was the fact the gnome menu is better....  just works better then the lxde menu...
[11:55] <l057c0d3r> Aknot, and you can do a lot more with it then i have in this picture.... this is almost a base install setup...
[11:55] <chuxxsss> Hi all

[11:56] <nazmulwanted> hi to all
[11:58] <judgen> Sorry to ask what might be a stupid question. I know that Unity depends on gnome bits and pieces. But what parts of unity warrants the dependency of Qt?
[11:59] <judgen> Do not get me wrong, i do not mind having Qt, quite the opposite. But why can not the entirety of unity been done in one toolkit?
[12:00] <FlowRiser> judgen, kde is done in qt; Whereas unity+compiz support qt, but don't actually depend on it.
[12:00] <nep1x> hi buddies! which is for you a good RSS/Atom reader for ubuntu?
[12:00] <FlowRiser> judgen, if you want a Qt Desktop, get kubuntu
[12:00] <judgen> nep1x: but if you install unity package it also pulls in Qt?
[12:01] <FlowRiser> judgen, what distro do you have ?
[12:01] <judgen> precise
[12:01] <FlowRiser> judgen, might be it does so for the unity-2d which is done in Qt
[12:01] <opalepatrick> anyone else see unity dash and launcher under/behind startup programmes etc? Need to logout and back to get it to act normally
[12:01] <FlowRiser> it is unsupported as of 12.10
[12:01] <judgen> so it is all gtk now?
[12:02] <FlowRiser> judgen, i'm not sure actually, might be so, but i hear they are looking into something else :D
[12:04] <kostkon> judgen, it isn't realistic to expect the whole desktop to be written in one toolkit. Anyway, it's just the qt deps you have on your system and not the KDE ones. There are a lot of qt apps. Just try to avoid installing KDE apps, there aren't many anyway, and you should be fine?
[12:04] <kostkon> judgen, e.g. the U1 client is a qt app.
[12:04] <judgen> ok
[12:06] <jimmy_lo> I use ubuntu 11.04, I am building webkit, but it shows the messag: configure: error: Package requirements (gtk+-3.0 >= 3.4.0) were not met: Requested 'gtk+-3.0 >= 3.4.0' but version of GTK+ is 3.0.8. I use "sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev", but it tells me that libgtk-3-dev is already the newest version.
[12:06] <ThinkT510> jimmy_lo: 11.04 is no longer supported
[12:07] <jimmy_lo> So I have to manually download and build it
[12:07] <Ben64> no, you need to upgrade
[12:07] <ThinkT510> jimmy_lo: to get support you need to be using a supported release
[12:07] <jrib> jimmy_lo: no, you should upgrade your ubuntu version to a supported one (12.04 or 12.10)
[12:08] <jimmy_lo> You mean upgrade ubuntu to 11.10 or higher
[12:08] <jimmy_lo> 12.04
[12:08] <Ben64> support for 11.04 ended in October 2012, so you haven't gotten any security updates since then
[12:08] <jrib> jimmy_lo: yes, though 11.10 will only have support until april, so I'd suggest going to at least 12.04 at this point
[12:08] <jimmy_lo> OMG, I didn't notice that
[12:08] <bilel> Hi, I've installed ubuntu last week and I can't get windows + ubuntu to be bootable on my machine, on the first install, it defaulted to windows, I've then run boot repair, this time grub screen was there, but windows not bootable (only ubuntu) because of "secure boot", I've disabled it from BIOS, and ran boot repair again, and now it defaults to windows again, I don't see grub screen, what...
[12:08] <bilel> ...can I do?
[12:08] <Ben64> if you don't like updating, go to 12.04, you only need to upgrade every 2 years with LTS
[12:08] <ThinkT510> jimmy_lo: the support schedules are clear
[12:09] <jimmy_lo> OK, thank you all
[12:10] <jimmy_lo> Wait a minute, so that's why it tells me that libgtk-3-dev is already the newest version.
[12:11] <jimmy_lo> so apt-get won't get anything new?
[12:11] <ThinkT510> jimmy_lo: 11.04 is from april 2011, it was likely the newest back then, the repos obviously have older software if you are using an older release

[12:52] <heshanh> is there way to check which apache is running? link the location of. i think i have more than one installed
[12:54] <erupter> Hi. Problem: I need to give two users write access to a folder on a machine, and have it propagated via NFS. Currently the original owner of the folder obviously has write access. The other user, has correctly mounted the NFS but has only read access.
[12:54] <heshanh> because even after i kill apache2 i can still view localhost
[12:54] <k1l_> compdoc: that is mentioned in the wiki articles. but recommended is to go to an supported release anyway
[12:54] <fidel> heshanh: you might start with: apt-cache policy apache2 - which will tell you the installed version via apt & the available in apt
[12:54] <erupter> I tried following some tutorials about adding users to groups and changing properties, but so far I only managed to eliminate read access not grant write access to the other user.
[12:55] <ThinkT510> jimmy_lo: any reason why you haven't got a supported release (please don't say you miss gnome2 or dislike unity)

[13:04] <bizhanMona> HI does ubuntu  support "hald" daemon? thx
[13:04] <fidel> if you havent heavily messed around and limited yourself on using apt only to install software - its highly unlikely that you have > 1 apapche version installed
[13:04] <fidel> heshanh: my next test would be stopping apache via: sudo service apache2 stop - and then check the running processes

[13:44] <ubottu> yogeshwaran: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience

[13:45] <yogeshwaran> @ubottu : ok :-)

[13:45] <fidel> what have you tried/where is the problem....
[13:46] <kracekumar> TakeItEZ, No output , but quid3 start/pre-start, process 7805
[13:46] <ubottu> yogeshwaran: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[13:46] <kracekumar> but ps aux | grep 7805 doesn't show the process
[13:46] <TakeItEZ> kracekumar: check logs (sudo grep -ri squid /var/log/) for errors
[13:46] <yogeshwaran> I'm scared that I will lose my windows..i've read some horror stories of ppl who lost windows 8 after installing ubuntu.
[13:47] <yogeshwaran> are there any special precautions i need to take

[13:47] <ubottu> yogeshwaran: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[13:47] <fidel> yogeshwaran: i havent tried dual-setup with win8 myself so far - best regarding fighting your fear is 'run a backup' before you start freeing space for ubuntu & continue to install it

[13:49] <compdoc> yogeshwaran, remove the hdd containing windows, pop in an ssd or laptop drive, and install linux. easy
[13:49] <fidel> !repeat | pokkerface
[13:50] <TakeItEZ> kracekumar: sounds like it fails to start, check configs again and try. sorry i don't know much about squid, so i can't really help you
[13:50] <yogeshwaran> @compdoc : i already have 32 gb of SSD in my laptop
[13:50] <kracekumar> TakeItEZ, Thanks
[13:53] <foolsh> kracekumar: make sure the cache directory exists and is initialized.  An easy way to do this is to install Webmin and look under the squid section there

[13:54] <expert_> hey guys how to kill a not responding program?
[13:54] <TakeItEZ> bot, wake up
[13:54] <TakeItEZ> expert_: pkill progname
[13:54] <zykotick9> expert_: you've got choices: kill, killall, xkill (and others)
[13:54] <ubottu> pokkerface: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
[13:54] <ubottu> webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. It is not compatible with the way that Ubuntu packages handle configuration files, and is likely to cause unexpected issues with your system.
[13:55] <foolsh> kracekumar: I've only ever used squid
[13:55] <kracekumar> foolsh, ok

[14:02] <ggherdov> Hi all. a couple of questions: (1) what is the Desktop Environment closest to Gnome 2 I can have on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ? (2) What is the cleanest way to unstall Unity and replace it with said desktop environment?
[14:02] <ThinkT510> ggherdov: xfce is great, don't remove unity
[14:03] <ThinkT510> ggherdov: also gnome3 has a fallback mode
[14:04] <mahem1> #kabbadi-in-canada
[14:04] <ggherdov> ThinkT510: xfce isn't close enough to Gnome 2 for me. What I need more than everything is the upper panel, with system monitors for RAM, network, disk, system load. And Unity cannot run on my system: it's a virtualbox with very limited RAM and no graphic acceleration
[14:05] <shadow98> http://pastebin.com/tKqBTi2d
[14:05] <nuxninja> ggherdov
[14:05] <ggherdov> nuxninja: yes
[14:05] <nuxninja> sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback
[14:05] <ThinkT510> ggherdov: i'm saying don't remove unity if it is already installed, it will leave a mess, i'm not saying you must use unity
[14:05] <Ben64> ggherdov: gnome fallback mode then, install gnome-panel and it should bring in everything you need for it
[14:06] <ggherdov> ThinkT510: understood. nuxninja , Ben64: thanks
[14:06] <ThinkT510> ggherdov: there are good plugins for xfce panels too
[14:06] <Ben64> not good enough, i wanted the same as ggherdov
[14:06] <ggherdov> ThinkT510: will check that, thankyou for the heads up
[14:07] <Ben64> theres no other panel that matches the cpu and ram system monitors
[14:07] <nuxninja> Ben64 agree you read my mid

[15:32] <aminb> kostcon: actually I'm not quite sure :/ when I connect my phone to my pc, in USB options settings in the phone there are two options. It is set on the first one. I don't have it handy right now to check again. I know i have to use mtp but i couldn't get it to work
[15:32] <KxTwo> Hey guys, is it still the consensus to get 12.04 instead of 12.10?
[15:33] <aminb> kostkon: actually I'm not quite sure :/ when I connect my phone to my pc, in USB options settings in the phone there are two options. It is set on the first one. I don't have it handy right now to check again. I know i have to use mtp but i couldn't get it to work
[15:33] <jhutchins_wk> roasted: It has a c in front of it instead of an s.  I always use fdisk 'cause that's what I learned in DOS 2.x
[15:34] <aminb> any ideas people? i seriously need to get this file transfer thing working :(
[15:35] <kostkon> aminb, UMS and MTP probably
[15:35] <kostkon> aminb, or PTP and MTP, but let me give you a link

[15:35] <roasted> jhutchins_wk: fdisk doesn't fly with GPT. And now that I did more digging on sfdisk, sfdisk isn't made for GPT either. I'm reading into cfdisk now.
[15:35] <jhutchins_wk> aminb: I guess I'm still on 4.1.1 - works great for me.
[15:36] <jhutchins_wk> roasted: Ah, for gpt you need parted.
[15:36] <aminb> kostkon: yeah sure. waiting
[15:36] <kostkon> aminb, you could try this: http://www.webupd8.org/2013/01/upgrade-to-gvfs-with-mtp-support-in.html
[15:36] <aminb> jhutchins_wk: but how did you get it to work?
[15:36] <roasted> jhutchins_wk: I looked into parted many times, but I never understood exactly how I would change the partition type.
[15:37] <jhutchins_wk> aminb: literally just plugged the phone into the PC.  It was so simple I was sure something must be wrong, but it just worked.
[15:37] <aminb> jhutchins_wk: you're so lucky then :)
[15:37] <aminb> kostkon: thanks. I'm gonna give this one a try. I'll let you know
[15:37] <kostkon> aminb, ok
[15:38] <roasted> jhutchins_wk: I assume I'm just doing it wrong. I keep getting invalid token when I try to set the partition type.
[15:39] <zykotick9> roasted: if you have access to a GUI, gparted makes creating a GPT partition "fairly" straightforward (i've never done it with parted, i really do need to learn that program)
[15:39] <roasted> zykotick9: I know GParted is such a win. I'm trying to learn the CLI equivalent since I work with headless servers from time to time.
[15:40] <zykotick9> roasted: i hear ya.  prior to gpt, i was all fdisk... now i'm "stuck" with replying on a GUI program :(..
[15:40] <BluesKaj> what's the command to find which repos contains a certain package ?
[15:40] <zykotick9> s/replying/relying/
[15:41] <zykotick9> BluesKaj: "apt-cache policy foo" then look at the url is one method
[15:41] <roasted> zykotick9: Realistically speaking, I'll likely just boot to a LiveUSB session and set the partitions up there. Then fire up the server and assemble the RAID via ssh over terminal.
[15:41] <roasted> zykotick9: but that doesn't take away from my desire to, at the very least, learn the CLI equivalent.
[15:41] <BluesKaj> dpkg -l doesn't  list all
[15:42] <BluesKaj> ok zykotick9 thanks
[15:42] <zykotick9> BluesKaj: sorry, i may have misunderstood your question
[15:44] <BluesKaj> no , zykotick9 that command works :)
[15:45] <BluesKaj> zykotick9, , i should have remembered , but my memory leaves gaps over time
[15:46] <zykotick9> BluesKaj: oh how i wish i could remember half of what i've forgotten ;)

[15:48] <BluesKaj> ctrl+alt +f1-6
[15:49] <BluesKaj> Viral, ^
[15:49] <Viral> yeah, I know how to get to them. but nothing displays. however I can still login and type in commands
[15:49] <aminb> kostkon: thanks! it DID work!! however, it didn't work with rhythmbox. Isn't there a solution for that? :/ or a better way to sync music?
[15:49] <BluesKaj> nothing is suppoed to display except the login prompt
[15:50] <BluesKaj> Viral,^
[15:50] <Viral> I know that?
[15:50] <Viral> literally nothing shows
[15:50] <zykotick9> Viral: did they ever work?  are you using nvidia/ati?  did you try to change the resolution?
[15:51] <BluesKaj> so you don't see the  prompt
[15:51] <kostkon> aminb, nice. hmm, strange. in rhythmbox try the menu option Music → Scan Removable Media
[15:51] <Viral> zykotick9,  yes they worked before I installed nvidia display drivers
[15:51] <zykotick9> Viral: from nvidia.com?
[15:51] <Viral> zykotick9, correct
[15:51] <kostkon> aminb, to force it to do a new scan
[15:51] <zykotick9> Viral: good luck then.  don't reply to me futher.
[15:52] <Viral> 0/2 for useful help. great!!
[15:52] <BluesKaj> Viral, didn't the additional drivers work ?

[15:59] <snaker> i am trying to install wireless samsung printer drivers in ubuntu. how do i do that?
[15:59] <snaker> 90% of the threads i find are shit
[15:59] <snaker> i have a CD
[15:59] <compdoc> roasted, larger drives use small 4k sectors, and if the partition isnt created at the right place, performance suffers
[15:59] <BluesKaj> isn't there a partition manager on gnome/unity ?
[16:00] <snaker> it has a .jar file in it
[16:00] <snaker> i cant run it
[16:00] <jim8888> yep just tried the built in ubuntu disk / partition managers but no joy...
[16:00] <roasted> compdoc: so it matters where the partition STARTS, not ends?
[16:00] <UbuntuNewbie> try gparted
[16:00] <compdoc> roasted, if you use a modern program like gparted to create the parttion, it will be correct
[16:01] <zykotick9> roasted: i didn't actually think alignment was such a big issue with HDs (though it was more a SSD issue?) but i could be wrong.  you might want to consult http://wiki.debian.org/SSDoptimization which discusses alignment and links to some youtube video explaining it.
[16:01] <roasted> compdoc: I ask this because I'm setting up a software array. I want to set my drives to have 100MB remaining. I was messing with gdisk and it asks me at the beginning where I want to start. So I select accordingly. But when it asks about ending, I have NO idea. I wasn't sure if the entire drive should be in specific intervals or what.
[16:01] <compdoc> roasted, I dont think it matters where it ends, but it might matter where 2nd or 3rd partitions on the same drive start
[16:01] <compdoc> I always use one large partition
[16:01] <roasted> perhaps I should stop with this CLI obsession and just use GParted. :/
[16:02] <compdoc> gparted is best
[16:02] <roasted> the documentation of a lot of these CLI tools is often half baked, whereas GParted is just kind of an instant winner.
[16:02] <snaker> i am trying to install wireless samsung printer drivers in ubuntu. how do i do that? i have the CD with the drivers, but not a single tutorial thread guide worked.
[16:02] <gmulak1> Snaker:  What is the Samsung, a printer?
[16:02] <compdoc> fdisk is too old
[16:02] <snaker> gmulak1: multi function printer
[16:02] <roasted> right - I was using gdisk
[16:02] <snaker> gmulak1: scanner printer etc
[16:02] <snaker> gmulak1: works perfectly on windows 7
[16:03] <gmulak1> Snaker:  Those can be hard.  Is the wireless working?  Properly?
[16:03] <snaker> gmulak1: yes, under win7 it is. its connected through the switch
[16:04] <snaker> theres a .jar file in the cd
[16:04] <snaker> but there are no threads that help
[16:05] <BluesKaj> jim8888, gparted should list the size of each disk/partition , unless they're encrypted ?

[16:11] <lemos_> do you like the ubuntu distro ?
[16:11] <karu_> Hey anyone know where linux drivers for intel gma 4500m is
[16:11] <karu_> I have to use nomodeset so that it doesnt boot to black
[16:12] <lemos_> run the additional drivers
[16:12] <lemos_> the drivers for intel
[16:12] <karu_> where
[16:12] <karu_> I'm new to this
[16:12] <roasted> as far as I know Intel's GPU drivers are open sourced, and therefore included within Linux without the need of going to Additional Drivers... whcih is normally the place to go for non-open source drivers, like Nvidia, AMD, etc....
[16:12] <lemos_> it's a app
[16:13] <lemos_> go in software center
[16:13] <roasted> Although the 4500 sticks out in my mind for some reason. I wonder if there was a bug resulting in that GPU to present a black screen.
[16:13] <roasted> You don't need to go to software center.

[16:13] <karu_> My friends tell me it's in the kernel
[16:13] <lemos_> and search
[16:13] <karu_> but it keeps booting to black screen
[16:13] <roasted> Additional Drivers is its own application within Ubuntu, outside of the software center.
[16:13] <ignerous> how to customize the clock applet in ubuntu 12.10
[16:13] <karu_> unless I put in "nomodeset"
[16:13] <roasted> karu_: yes, Intel drivers are open source. Open source software is oten included into Linux (the kernel) by default.
[16:14] <lemos_> all the people here,is using the Ubuntu ?
[16:14] <karu_> Dunno what's going on
[16:14] <roasted> karu_: in short: There is, as far as I know, no reason to look for external drivers for Intel GPU's because they're already included by default.
[16:14] <karu_> Then why does it boot to a black screen
[16:14] <roasted> karu_: it booting to a black screen doesn't mean you don't have the driver, it just means there's an issue somewhere... maybe a bug? It's hard to say.
[16:15] <roasted> karu_: but you have the driver installed because you have the kernel installed because the kernel is part of the entire Linux system.....
[16:15] <roasted> karu_: so there are no additional drivers to get with the Intel GPU you have.
[16:15] <karu_> Well it says I'm using some veza graphics driver
[16:15] <roasted> I'm not sure. I've never had an issue with Intel so I can't really comment too much further. I just know you won't find any Intel drivers within Ubuntu Software Center or Additional Drivers.
[16:15] <karu_> This laptop resolution is 1366x768 or something like that

[16:16] <ignerous> how to customize the clock applet in ubuntu 12.10

I managed with rsyslog to store my log files from local0 into my mysql database. now based on facility i can see what he maps. but is there a file somewhere that tells me what applications map to local0, and where i can add remove applications that log to local0?
[17:15] <zykotick9> jose106: "echo $SHELL"
[17:15] <xangua> ignerous: you did read that is for gnome2 right¿
[17:15] <andre> !list
[17:15] <ubottu> andre: No warez here! This is not a file sharing channel (or network); read the channel topic. If you're looking for information about me, type « /msg ubottu !bot ». If you're looking for a channel, see « /msg ubottu !alis ».
[17:17] <lucis> as far as i understand it now, daemons log the log files to a certain local file. can i see a list of which daemons map to which locals?
[17:17] <jose106> zykotick9, that gave me /bin/bash
[17:17] <zykotick9> jose106: that's you shell!
[17:18] <zykotick9> jose106: use "echo $TERM" to find what terminal you are using.
[17:18] <jose106> xterm
[17:19] <gmulak1> jose106:   # echo $SHELL
[17:19] <jose106> zykotick9, my bad, I meant desktop environment
[17:19] <zykotick9> jose106: don't know... good luck.

[17:28] <UlyssesGa> Hi there!  Repeat question from yesterday.  I'm having a problem dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04.  Non-UEFI system (so no Secure boot).  Each installation is on its own hard drive, with the Ubuntu drive being the set as the primary bootable device in the system BIOS. (grub2 also situated on linux drive).
[17:28] <UlyssesGa> If Win8 is set as the first bootable HD, it starts fine.  If the Ubuntu drive is chosen as the 1st bootable drive and I attempt to boot to Win 8 from grub, Win8 immediately reboots.
[17:28] <gmulak1> jose106:  SCaLE is always in LA and always February.  It's very informative.  BTW askubuntu.com is also a help.  Come back though!
[17:29] <jose106> gmdeux_, Thanks
[17:29] <UlyssesGa> I was running Win7/Ubuntu but then upgraded to Win8.  Win7/Ubuntu (in the configuration noted above) functioned OK.  I ran update-grub
[17:29] <trism> ignerous: it works if you use gnome classic, so it isn't an indicator-datetime bug, it's an issue with how unity sends widgets, not really fixable without some considerable changes to the unity code

[17:34] <PrincessLuna> Is it possible to install Ubuntu on one partition / and have both /var and /home on a different (but common) partition?
[17:35] <zykotick9> PrincessLuna: i don't think so.  you'd need /var and /home to be on separate partitions, so you can mount them properly.
[17:36] <zykotick9> PrincessLuna: perhaps you could link them... but i wouldn't recommend it.
[17:37] <PrincessLuna> If I am installing Ubuntu on a tiny SSD and a large HDD, what should I keep in the HDD to save space apart from /home and /var ... I was thinking of installing in a 5gb ssd partition
[17:38] <ignerous> trism: the "\n" works but the the font size cannot be decreased

[17:40] <kdsmain> I know there's a LDAP channel, but nobody seems to be awake in it, so forgive me for asking, but with OpenLDAP, is the /etc/ldapscripts/ldapscripts.passwd really just supposed to say "secret"?

In my conky network stat; the 500 KiB/s remains equilibrium...Whereas on Speedtest my reported speed is 5-6 Mbit/s. Can anyone explain/help me?

[18:01] <nanashiRei> o/ everyone. Quite new to using a non windows system for work and i've googled my fingers bleeding. Is there a way to really disable the password prompt or increase the cache time?
[18:01] <nanashiRei> tbh, it's worth then back in Vista days :(
[18:01] <jrib> nanashiRei: yes, but what are you doing that requires you to enter the password so often?  It seems unusual
[18:02] <nanashiRei> Just the fact that i do have to enter it again after login into my account which is not automatic makes it a hassle in my eyes.
[18:03] <jrib> nanashiRei: well again, what are you doing that you're being asked for a password?
[18:04] <nanashiRei> And and i'm a fan ob shell scripts that i can click to enable and disable my development environment, so these require a password. I got rid of the shell prompt with the usual NOPASSWD: sudo thing
[18:05] <nanashiRei> And i kinda answesered the question you ask with the fact that i'm new to this kind of environment. So i am trying all kinds of software packages
[18:05] <nanashiRei> and ... there is 5 Minutes, ofc, between installs.
[18:05] <nanashiRei> It's interrupting my workflow pretty badly :<
[18:07] <nanashiRei> i see how disabling woud be a security risk if i had ssh installed or someone would ever gain access to that notebook, but that's not going to happen since it's mounted to my desktop :x
[18:07] <jrib> nanashiRei: you can keep a terminal around with "sudo -i", that will give a you shell where you can install things and such.  You can disable the password altogether with NOPASSWD in sudoers as you mention, but I wouldn't advise it. You could also increase the cache time... IMO you'll run out of things to install soon enough :)
[18:08] <nanashiRei> But, isn't this kinda backwards, i like ubuntu, no question. But Windows 7 and Windows 8 even are less annoying in that aspect :/
[18:09] <Zeid> hi guys
[18:09] <nanashiRei> Still there is nothign better then linux to administrate other linux systems :D
[18:09] <nanashiRei> ing*
[18:09] <Zeid> i'm a newbie in ubuntu and i have a couple of questions
[18:09] <jrib> nanashiRei: backwards in what way?  It shouldn't be necessary to do administrative tasks every 10 minutes so that it gets annoying
[18:09] <XtremeWiz> Zeid: Like?
[18:10] <Zeid> i want to install ubuntu but my pc is conected to a plasma tv
[18:10] <kvothetech> Zeid: which prevents installation why
[18:10] <nanashiRei> jrib: i'm used to dealing with Servers. And by default i enter them with a SSH Key... so there is 1 prompt per system startup (Pagent) and that's it :x
[18:11] <kanikilu> nanashi
[18:11] <jrib> nanashiRei: presumably you'd still enter the password when you sudo?
[18:11] <Zeid> so what about the drivers cuz i tried once to install it and when the installation begins it gives NO SIGNAL
[18:11] <nanashiRei> In general i don't even make use of sudo.
[18:12] <nanashiRei> other than elevating me to root with it.
[18:12] <Zeid> so i cant see whats going on!!
[18:12] <nanashiRei> Zeid, finish the installation. And don't use hardware from 1999 :D
[18:13] <nanashiRei> j/k after installation there is non-opensource drivers at your disposal
[18:13] <jrib> nanashiRei: that's fine.  You can do that if you are in the situation where you need to do a series of things as superuser (with "sudo -i").
[18:14] <Zeid> cool so the installation process will go smooth?! right!
[18:14] <ExxKA> Hey guys, I am using apt-get to install nodejs, but I can only select between version 0.6.12 and 0.8.18, but on launchpad I see version 0.6.19 and that is the usual version. How do I go about getting it?

[18:26] <threex5> huh
[18:27] <threex5> ok does that uninstall ubuntu's built in clipboard manager?
[18:27] <jrib> threex5: does it have one by default?
[18:27] <threex5> ubuntu's documentation says that clipboard persistence is a known bug. they recommend parcellite

[18:28] <jrib> threex5: sure, that's a good one

=== root is now known as Guest68686
[18:29] <jrib> threex5: nah, the apps are responsible for what's in the clipboard, that's why if you copy something, close the app, then try to paste somewhere else, you won't get anything
[18:30] <jrib> threex5: parcellite does some nice things.  You can sync your two clipboards, you can make actions, you get a history.  It's probably worth it if you use your clipboard a lot
[18:30] <threex5> ok i'll try parcellite. do you think it's nicer than glipper?
[18:30] <jrib> threex5: I don't know.  Try both in turn and see which you like
[18:30] <kanikilu> threex5: not sure if it applies, but when I copy some text (for example), then before pasting, do something like click-and-drag a file in nautilus to move it, the previous copied text is gone
[18:30] <kanikilu> ...is there any pattern like that for you, or just random?
[18:31] <ExxKA> Thank you all, I will look into backports
[18:31] <threex5> kanikilu, good to know. I haven't noticed that specifically, but I'll keep that in mind

[19:18] <poq> Is any software for web page monitoring for changes?
[19:19] <CyL> jrib: Well, already tried that files but it actually only holds the tasks descriptions
[19:19] <flintser> esph, ok thanks, i see brackets in other ssh clients so maybe it is a problem with putty after all...

[19:22] <CyL> zykotick9: You have to run tasksel
[19:23] <sianhulo> nobody have tried to install vmware?
[19:23] <zykotick9> CyL: upstream has those packages, guess ubuntu removes them :(
[19:23] <jrib> CyL: ah, well "Key" lists the essential packages.  Then you must query your packages to see which have the appropriate task field apparently
[19:24] <CyL> jrib: you mean doing a search on packages descriptions/titles for the key "lamp-server"?
[19:24] <jrib> CyL: example: aptitude search '~tlamp-server'
[19:24] <jrib> CyL: there are special fields apparently for tasks

=== Guest30124 is now known as Lorux
[19:29] <zykotick9> CyL: stick with apt-get is safest option in ubuntu.  but aptitude should work, and using one or the other "shouldn't" matter.
[19:30] <cvsdave> ubottu thanks!
[19:30] <ubottu> You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)
[19:30] <SonikkuAmerica> Well, aptitude has Easter eggs.
[19:30] <nronksr> What is the easiest way to see a grub menu (without rebooting) after adding additional kernels to set the GRUB_DEFAULT option to the desired kernel?
[19:30] <CyL> jrib: I haven't been working with debian/ubuntu for a long time, I find it sometimes easier to use apt related tools, and others aptitude, I was just afraid that would mess up with my package base the way it used to
[19:31] <kaushal> Hi
[19:31] <zykotick9> SonikkuAmerica: so does apt-get, try "apt-get moo" sudo not required
[19:31] <kaushal> Any GUI to ping multiple servers or hosts?
[19:31] <kaushal> available on Ubuntu
[19:31] <kaushal> similar to http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/multiple_ping_tool.html
[19:31] <jrib> CyL: just don't use tasksel to remove tasks.  You can actually use apt-get to intall tasks with something like: apt-get install lamp-server^   (actually I'm not sure if the ^ should be a prefix or suffix)
[19:32] <SonikkuAmerica> zykotick9, did you use the v-switches
[19:32] <jrib> CyL: also, I am reading documentation now and you can use "tasksel --task-packages lamp-server" to list packages
[19:32] <CyL> jrib: I don't want to install a lamp task, I'm going to run the webserver on a computer and the database server on the other. I'd just like to see what are the relevant packages for the webserver.
[19:32] <kunji> jrib: suffix, just like your example.
[19:33] <CyL> jrib: Thanks very much, I'm sorry for not getting that info from the manual.
[19:34] <jrib> CyL: no problem, this way I learned about it too :)
[19:34] <gmulak1> L3top - please see private message - thanks
[19:34] <kunji> CyL: Well, it depends, the web server itself is just Apache, though you could use other ones instead, like Nginx.  But then if you want PHP, then you'll also need PHP, or if you want PERL, etc...
[19:35] <jrib> CyL: if you "/msg ubottu lamp" he gives you wiki link where the packages are listed explicitly as well
[19:35] <flintser> esph: i changed some colors and it helped, thanks :)
[19:35] <CyL> kunji: Yes, I just want to avois installing mysqlserver on the webserver
[19:35] <kunji> CyL: Then you would install just the database, say MySQL or MariaDB on the other.

[19:36] <kunji> CyL: It' not the installing part that's obnoxious when doing something like this, it's usually the part where you need to configure the webserver and database to talk to each other.

[19:56] <zykotick9> musetux: let me guess, you used usermod to try and add a user to a group?
[19:57] <musetux> great quess!  or im a uber tool!
[19:57] <sianhulo> someone uses vmware?I cant start it up, says that there is no kernel generic module
[19:57] <zykotick9> musetux: using usermod needs a "-a" to append, or you loose all other groups.  in future, using useradd is a lot safer.
[19:58] <thoonai_> kunji: thx :D
[19:58] <adamk> sianhulo: If vmware is looking for one of it's kernel modules, and can't find it, it should ask you if it can install the module.
[19:58] <musetux> thanks zykotick9, I was rushing, should have read the man oage
[20:00] <lesshaste> how do I do this? Copy prog/init/lm_sensors.init to /etc/init.d/lm_sensors
[20:00] <lesshaste> where is this prog?
[20:00] <nat> anybody i, Belgium ??
[20:00] <nat> Belgium ?
[20:01] <johnnyfireworks> sianhulo,  state your question with your pc secs and your program specs. to avoid future 21 question game. and in the end you less likly not to get it fixed,because someone gave up.
[20:01] <sianhulo> adamk, I have the module installed, vmware itself suggest to find another location in the case it is somewhere else or isntall it myself
=== thoonai_ is now known as thoonai
[20:01] <adamk> I have never heard of that before.  Please show the *exact* message you are receiving.

[20:03] <musetux> zykotick9: would you say; time for a re-install?
[20:04] <sianhulo> johnnyfireworks, i think the only relevat information about this subject is that I have ubutnu 12.10 and kernel 3.7.0-7
[20:04] <kunji> musetux: No, boot from a live cd and chroot, add a new user.
[20:05] <musetux> kunji:  Thank you. I'll give that a go
[20:05] <zykotick9> musetux: no.  just boot recovery and add your user back to the required groups (sorry i don't use ubuntu, so don't know what groups you need)
[20:05] <kunji>  musetux: Or rather, you just removed your user from all the groups right?  So add the groups back rather than making a new user.
[20:06] <flintser> why not rescue and adduser?
=== linuxthefish` is now known as linuxthefish
[20:07] <musetux> zykotick9: thanks that's not to bad idea, like that one too/
[20:07] <kunji> musetux: I don't know if it's all the groups you'll need, or if you need all of these ones, but for reference my user if part of his own group (The same as the user name), adm, cdrom, sudo, plugdev, lpadmin, and sambashare
[20:07] <kunji> *is not if
[20:08] <kunji> flintser: Hmm, rescue should also work I think.  We don't really want to adduser because it would leave his old user hanging, but he could remove the old user first and then add one with the same name.
[20:08] <lesshaste> what's a nice graphical app to show cpu temp etc
[20:09] <kunji> lesshaste: Conky, you can write whatever lua + Cairo script you want if you want fancier graphics than the defaults.
[20:10] <sianhulo> I'm trying to start vmware but it says that the generic kernel module wasn't found, is there a way to fix this?
[20:10] <musetux> flintser: Thank you very much for the suggestion, i may try that do to impaitents  of redownloading the .iso for a liveCD
[20:11] <kunji> lesshaste: sudo apt-get install conky  Then cp /etc/conky/conky.conf ~/.conkyrc   Or you can write your own .conkyrc, the options are further explained in the man page.
[20:11] <lesshaste> thanks
[20:12] <musetux> flintser, kunji, zykotick9: Thank you so much for all your help, imma get cracking on this!!

[22:25] <DrGrov> Could it be connected with my xorg.conf configuration and nVidia GPU? I forced 1920x1080 resolution as a modeline in xorg.conf and have not had any issues until now this past week.

[22:32] <tremby> oh, i thought it was an error code
[22:32] <tremby> ok
[22:33] <tremby> i've 99% sure it's just because apt-get update hasn't run
[22:33] <tremby> how do i tell software center to do that?
[22:33] <tremby> or does that apt-cache policy line tell you that's not the issue
[22:34] <flintser> nwp: now that i look at it i might buy intense-pc for home media center + running irssi and ftp servers
[22:34] <PingIT> Hi just got a fast question here, i can se my wtmp gets a little big, wood it be safe to ln -s /dev/null /var/log/wtmp the file?
[22:34] <flintser> never knew those existed before
[22:34] <thinklinux> anyone ever experienced this, was surfing the web and suddenly shows a black screen (in fullscreen) with a bunch of text scrolling down really fast...had to end up a doing a hard reboot..(ubuntu 12.10)
[22:35] <jrib> tremby: correct, but if you want to you can go to software-sources in the edit menu and probably just toggle something
[22:35] <chaos_plague> my terminal window only shows messages in the currect screen it clears any messages that i must scroll up to see is there a way to change that?
[22:35] <JosthynPower> alguien habla español
[22:35] <tremby> jrib: i've tried that, toggled various sources off and on and i never get an offer to update and it still isn't showing in searches
[22:35] <jrib> tremby: does it show up in synaptic ok?
[22:35] <tremby> but i do aptitude search acroread and there it is
[22:36] <tremby> i didn't install synaptic yet, i'll do that now
[22:36] <thoonai> kunji: yuo are great.
[22:36] <WBF> thinklinux: was there 2 penguins? an ubuntu symbol? what was there on the top of the screen? the only time I experince that is when I boot my custom linux pc.
[22:36] <jrib> tremby: not every package is displayed in software-center I think (like dev libraries).  I don't know too much about that
[22:36] <thoonai> kunji: thx. I somehow overread the --format tiif flag
[22:37] <flintser> tremby why dont you want to use terminal
[22:37] <WBF> I'm having an issue too: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1594755/
[22:37] <tremby> jrib: like i said, it is now displayed even though it is not installed on my laptop
[22:37] <jrib> tremby: but it was once installed
[22:37] <flintser> i can see acroread too
[22:37] <flintser> never used
[22:37] <WBF> and at the end it says invalid module format.
[22:37] <tremby> flintser: because i want my friend who is trying out ubuntu for the first time to never see the command line if at all possible, which it ought to be
[22:38] <flintser> he's going to see it eventually :)
[22:39] <chaos_plague> exit
[22:39] <tremby> jrib: ok, in synaptic it appears
[22:39] <tremby> then i closed software centre and opened it again and now it appears in software centre
[22:39] <tremby> maybe synaptic forced an update
[22:39] <tremby> apt-cache policy line is identical
[22:40] <jrib> tremby: weird
[22:40] <flintser> but you can install acroreader now?
[22:41] <tremby> it appears in the software center so i assume so. it's totally retarded that it wasn't showing up before. i think it must be a bug, it's not updating after sources are changed
[22:41] <tremby> another retarded thing is that if i search "adobe reader" it doesn't appear in the results, but i search "acroread" and it does, even though its title is "Adobe Reader"
[22:42] <zathras_laptop> apt-get is telling me The following packages have unmet dependencies.
[22:42] <flintser> you could've just download foxit reader, it has .deb installers downloadable
[22:42] <zathras_laptop>  libapache2-mod-wsgi : Depends: libpython2.7 (>= 2.7) but it is not going to be installed
[22:42] <zathras_laptop> E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
[22:43] <zathras_laptop> any ideas how i can fix that? i sort of need mod-wsgi
[22:43] <tremby> flintser: that's also something i don't want to put him through. i want him to be able to install the stuff he needs from software centre. that's its purpose after all
[22:43] <jrib> zathras_laptop: sudo apt-get update, then try again.  If it still fails, pastebin « apt-cache policy libapache2-mod-wsgi libpython2.7 »
[22:44] <jrib> tremby: you should probably file a bug at least about the search (if software center isn't searching titles)
[22:45] <tremby> yeah
[22:45] <flintser> mine finds adobe reader if i try it
[22:45] <zathras_laptop> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1594833/
[22:45] <tremby> flintser: yours is updated
[22:45] <tremby> so the issue, i think, is that after adding a new source it gave no option to update
[22:46] <jrib> zathras_laptop: we may have to do a lot of pastebinning... output of: sudo apt-get install libpython2.7
[22:46] <cschneid> Does anybody have a good guide on locking down a web server? Jails & configs & similar
[22:47] <flintser> if i add a repo through software center it shows up
[22:47] <zathras_laptop> jrib, now pastebin won't let me paste....
[22:47] <zathras_laptop> libpython2.7 : Depends: python2.7 (= 2.7.3-0ubuntu3.1) but 2.7.3-1+lucid1 is to be installed

[22:47] <jrib> zathras_laptop: there are hundreds of pastebins
[22:47] <flintser> just tried that with vsftpd with writable chroot -repo
[22:47] <zathras_laptop> jrib, think those are the lines that matter?
[22:47] <jrib> zathras_laptop: yes, we are getting close.  What is the output of « apt-cache policy python2.7 »
[22:48] <setient> kunji: its booting
[22:48] <setient> i am going to install 12.10 i think
[22:48] <setient> its only got 320 megs of ram :(

[22:51] <zathras_laptop> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1594878/
[22:52] <jrib> zathras_laptop: the issue is you have this installed: 2.7.3-1+lucid1
[22:52] <jrib> zathras_laptop: it is not from the standard repositories it seems
[22:52] <zathras_laptop> jrib, hmm, ok, so can i remove it?
[22:53] <jrib> zathras_laptop: removing python would probably break a lot of things.  You can try to downgrade but make sure you have backups just in case
[22:53] <zathras_laptop> jrib, that's what i feared
[22:53] <zathras_laptop> how do i downgrade?
[22:56] <alcuadrado> If I create my own live-cd version of ubuntu, can I make it mount all partitions in the available disks automatically?
[22:58] <iceroot> alcuadrado: that should be the default
[22:58] <alcuadrado> great iceroot! thanks
[22:58] <iceroot> alcuadrado: ubuntu is mounting all partitions by default here on my system
[22:59] <kunji> setient: I was gone for dinner, SPARC, nice ^_^, and booting is good too.
[23:00] <setient> kunji: i am going to install it later.  i am at work
[23:01] <kunji> iceroot: Mine does not mount all partitions by default.
[23:01] <setient> i thin i want to setup a netboot server and od it that way
[23:01] <jrib> zathras_laptop: sudo apt-get install PACKAGE=VERSION
[23:01] <kunji> setient: mmk, well, I leave this running a lot even when I'm not here so you'll probably be able to find me again.
[23:01] <setient> hotness.
[23:02] <iceroot> kunji: from the same hdd?
[23:02] <iceroot> kunji: even nautilus is showing all of my partitons (ext4, ntfs, fat)
[23:03] <kunji> iceroot: nautilus shows all my partitions, but only / and /swap were mounted by default on my install, I added 3 others to fstab myself.

[23:04] <MacroMan_afn> Just installed Ubuntu 12.04 and switched to gnome, but I don't have any VPN options in the network manager applet or network settings. How can I set open a VPN connection?
[23:05] <MacroMan_afn> I have options for wired and wireless settings like normal, but nothing about VPN. I've googled, but can't find anything relavent.
[23:07] <Triups> ubuntu 12.10: One of my nics has a 50% chance of coming up as p33p2.  the other 50% of the time it comes up as rename3.  How do I stabilize this?
[23:09] <BluPhenix316> i have a problem but i'm not sure which channel i should ask, I have ubuntu 12.10 64bit installed and currently updated, i did a sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop and it gets to update-initramfs and just hangs there
[23:09] <BluPhenix316> is this a #ubuntu problem or a #kubuntu problem?
[23:09] <iceroot> Triups: hm, it should always have the same name  the name is defined in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  and related to the mac address
[23:09] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: ubuntu
[23:09] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: but building a new initramfs takes some time
[23:10] <backbox> Trying out a new distro (Backbox) and I can't load jockey (either -gtk or -text). Getting this error: ImportError: No module named xml.parsers.expat
[23:10] <kunji> MacroMan_afn: Umm, the ones for OpenVPN you mean right?  I don't use gnome, so I couldn't really say, maybe try their channel, or #openvpn Also I think there's a way to do it on the command line without bothering with plugins.
[23:10] <backbox> Also, jockey is a terrible name for a program when it won't start. Makes searching through google full of horses :/
[23:10] <flintser> iceroot: mounting isnt the same as them showing up in nautilus
[23:10] <flintser> they mount when you click them
[23:10] <Doomhammer> hi, i'm trying to connect to my network with the ubuntu livecd and it won't do it - ive tried the same cable & port with another machine, and i get a dhcp lease just fine, but not on this one - i have a realtek rtl8111/8168b
[23:10] <flintser> rtl8111/8168b
[23:10] <flintser> sorry :)
[23:10] <Doomhammer> flintser: ?
[23:10] <WBF> Doomhammer: I have the same issue as you on my ARM pc. I tried and tried to get the RTL8xxx driver to work but nothing.
[23:10] <flintser> Doomhammer: i used click copying accidentally
[23:10] <Doomhammer> oh heh
[23:10] <agsel> how to change keyboard shortcuts?
[23:10] <Triups> iceroot, thats the weird thing...I reboot and you flip the coin.  When it loads up as rename3 it has to do the 60second timeout during booting
[23:10] <WBF> Doomhammer: mine is a 8192CU driver
[23:11] <BluPhenix316> iceroot: i understand that but 30 minutes to a hour is a long time, i am running a i7, quadcore with hyperthreading and 8gigs of ram, and its never taken longer than a minute
[23:11] <BluPhenix316> i tried update-initramfs -u -v and it gets to this line: Adding module /lib/modules/3.5.0-23-generic/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/drm_kms_helper.ko
[23:11] <BluPhenix316>  and just stalls there
[23:11] <flintser> Doomhammer: does it even recognize your card?
[23:11] <Triups> iceroot, the p33p* and rename* do not show up there
[23:12] <Triups> iceroot, Ill try manually entering them
[23:13] <iceroot> Triups: there should be something like SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="24:b6:fd:fc:97:5f", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
[23:13] <Triups> iceroot, there is a bunch of them to match the nics.  but the nics p33p1, p33p2 do not show up there
[23:13] <iceroot> Triups: what should that be? vmware? xen?
[23:14] <iceroot> Triups: are you using something like that?
[23:14] <Doomhammer> flintser: yeah, it shows up in ifconfig, and networkmanager tries to get a dhcp lease
[23:14] <Triups> nope...I read thats how linux now names nics.  based on pci slot and port
[23:14] <Doomhammer> it "appears" to work, except i never get an ip address
[23:14] <Triups> iceroot, supposedly p33p1 means pci 33 port 1
[23:15] <iceroot> Triups: ah ok
[23:15] <flintser> Doomhammer: can you use static ip?
[23:15] <Doomhammer> flintser: i tried that, still doesn't work
[23:16] <Triups> iceroot, the problem comes that it doesn't always rename the nic properly to p33p2
[23:16] <Triups> iceroot, the file you mentioned does not mention anythign about these nics and sounds like it is auto-generated...has me a bit worried on how to rename the KERNEL parameter specifically
[23:17] <flintser> Doomhammer: so you can't get any connection? do you use a router or what?
[23:17] <iceroot> Triups: i would just create a new line and replace the mac address and a name you want for it
[23:17] <Doomhammer> flintser: uh, i'm at an office, i really don't know what they have going on
[23:18] <Doomhammer> flintser: i verified that plugging a different pc in with the same port/cable gets a dhcp lease just fine, though
[23:18] <Triups> iceroot, but the kernel parameter...what do I set that to?  the examples show "eth*" but I don't think this nic ever starts out as eth*
[23:19] <flintser> Doomhammer: problem might exist on the other end
[23:19] <iceroot> Triups: you can even put "foobar" in it
[23:19] <iceroot> Triups: its just a string
[23:19] <iceroot> Triups: which is related to the mac address
[23:19] <iceroot> Triups: imo
[23:19] <iceroot> Triups: so eth1 for example would be fine
[23:20] <flintser> check your gateway on the other computer and try ro ping that?
[23:20] <flintser> i mean check the gw and then plug ubuntu back in and try pinging
[23:22] <Triups> iceroot, I was thinking that string meant what the kernel was calling it and name is what you set it to....Ill try it out
[23:22] <Doomhammer> flintser: check the gateway in what way? other machines have an internet connection so the gateway is working apparently
[23:22] <BluPhenix316> iceroot: i found out what is causing update-initramfs to hang, but not sure how to fix it
[23:23] <iceroot> Triups: that string is telling the kernel how to name it
[23:23] <BluPhenix316> iceroot: update-initramfs hangs when doing modprobe --set-version=3.5.0-23-generic --ignore-install --quiet --show-depends i915
[23:23] <iceroot> Triups: so the name "eth0" comes from that file and the kernel is using that name then
[23:23] <iceroot> Triups: the kernel does not use eth0 before
[23:23] <iceroot> Triups: the kernel is asking udev what name should be used, so udev is generating that wil
[23:23] <iceroot> Triups: and you can call it "myfunnynic0" for example
[23:24] <flintser> Doomhammer: gateway ip address. if theyre windows 7 go to network and sharing center -> change adapter settings -> right click your connection -> status -> details
[23:24] <flintser> i mean the working computers
[23:24] <Doomhammer> flintser: my gateway is 10.10.10.1, and setting that statically doesn't seem to help anything

[23:25] <lucis> hey all, simple question. does anybody has a good analyze script for the auth.log file? . i would like to draw every host connection (failed or not) with the ip, and then run a whois on it.
[23:25] <lucis> have*
[23:25] <Triups> iceroot, I think udev might be th eone responsible for calling my nic p33p2 and rename3.  so i wonder if setting eth* will work at all...but a reboot will tell me
[23:25] <BluPhenix316> iceroot: really? i just got it today
[23:25] <flintser> if you can ping 10.10.10.1 on your ubuntu machine it means the problem is most likely at the other end
[23:26] <BluPhenix316> iceroot: i always do a sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade and it was in the repos i have
[23:26] <BluPhenix316> hmmm
[23:26] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: what is the output of "apt-cache policy linux-image-generic"

[23:31] <BluPhenix316> do I have a bad kernel or something installed?

[23:31] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: no, everything fine, ubottu is just showing a wrong text
[23:32] <BluPhenix316> well i still can't figure out my update-initramfs problem
[23:32] <BluPhenix316> maybe i should reboot and then try again?
[23:32] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: dont reboot
[23:32] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: the newest kernel will probably not boot
[23:33] <BluPhenix316> if i do a sudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop and then apt-get autoremove will it remove the newly installed packages and return to where i was before?
[23:33] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: no
[23:33] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: but the kubuntu-desktop package is not the reason for the kernel-update
[23:33] <BluPhenix316> yeah but i've rebooted since the kernel update
[23:34] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: i would cancel the upgrade and run "sudo dpkg --configure -a" after that i would have a look if "dpkg -l | grep -v ^ii | grep -v ^rc" is holding any packagenames, if not i would reboot
[23:34] <iceroot> BluPhenix316: and when the reboot fails select an older kernel from the grub-menu and not the 3.5.0-23
[23:34] <BluPhenix316> and everything was working fine, that kernel update was earlier today

[23:50] <BluPhenix316> iceroot: only reason i went with 12.10 is because this is a uefi system, and 12.10's installer had fixed a lot of issues 12.04 had with uefi
[23:50] <kunji> dorohoro: what is existing that you don't want to delete?
[23:50] <WBF> can someone help me? my 8192CU drivers aren't working. MORE DETAIL: It's a netgear that isn't working in ubuntu even with modprobe because modprobe comes up with an error on my custom linux box.

[23:54] <dorohoro> can i somehow mount folder on folder or something like that
[23:54] <dorohoro> i did this once in windows wista when i had it
[23:55] <mojtaba> Why ubuntu is better than mint?
[23:57] <WBF> mojtaba: their kind of equal; as in they have most of the same packages. it's your choice but I am trying to guide you.
[23:57] <kunji> dorohoro: I think the icon might not be a property of the folder, that is, I think it is handled purely in the outside apps, like nautilus, so I think just deleting Music and creating a symlink should do what you want, but there is a small chance it won't.  Maybe just move Music, (mv Music MusicBackup) and then create the symlink, so you can delete the symlink and put back music if it doesn't work the way you hoped.
[23:58] <phoenixsampras> hellow!
[23:58] <dorohoro> ok th
[23:58] <dorohoro> i will try something
[23:59] <kunji> dorohoro: Or actually I can try it out, I'm not picky about the icon so it's fine if it breaks it for me and I can let you know
