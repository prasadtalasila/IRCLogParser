[16:38] <jcastro> popey: ping
[16:40] <popey> jcastro: pong!
[16:40] <jcastro> hey so
[16:40] <jcastro> this G+ thing
[16:40] <jcastro> I am thinking of just asking to see if any forum moderators would be interested in helping
[16:41] <jcastro> I _really_ want to just Jorge the whole thing and burn large swaths of the posts with fire
[16:41] <jcastro> but that's probably not very collaborative
[16:41] <jcastro> so I was thinking if there's a group of existing forum moderators that want to lend their expertise ...
[16:41] <popey> i alredy do that
[16:41] <jcastro> oh ok
[16:41] <jcastro> did you just add them or what?
[16:41] <popey> anything which looks like blog spam
[16:41] <popey> no, i mean "do a jorge"
[16:42] <jcastro> oh, right right
[16:42] <popey> if it's blog spam i remove it, if its inappropriate i remove and ban
[16:42] <jcastro> yeah so the "doing a jorge" is easy for obvious spam and garbage
[16:42] <jcastro> I am talking for like
[16:43] <jcastro> some of the more useless stuff
[16:43] <jcastro> I dunno, maybe I want too much out of the thing and we should just let it be
[16:43] <jcastro> I was envisioning an awesome little water cooler where we could show off little apps, fun things
[16:43]  * mhall119 also burns posts with fire
[16:44] <mhall119> jcastro: I'm okay with useless stuff as long as it's not inappropriate
[16:44] <mhall119> makes it more "community" and less "marketing"
[16:44] <jcastro> yeah I just wanted something more highbrow than the facebook page
[16:44] <mhall119> well it's better than the FB comments, for sure
[16:45] <jcastro> More "check out my cool new thing I've been working on" , not just people resharing "linux is better than windows" crap
[16:45] <mhall119> jcastro: have we had much of that?
[16:45] <mhall119> the "check out my cool new thing" we have being posted on the Ubuntu App Developers community
[16:45] <jcastro> it feels like a bunch of regurgitation
[16:45] <popey> we've had a fair number of "Why is unity better than.."
[16:46] <mhall119> we made a "showcase" sub-topic or whatever they're called
[16:46] <popey> but it's end users, it's to be expected
[16:46] <jcastro> yeah
[16:46] <jcastro> so in hindsight
[16:46] <popey> we're crossing the chasm with this
[16:46] <popey> as with fb
[16:46] <jcastro> I am wondering if we should have created individual communities
[16:46] <jcastro> instead maybe put them all as subcategories of just "ubuntu"
[16:46] <jcastro> to help bring the signal up
[16:47] <popey> it could get unweildy
[16:47] <jcastro> popey: well if you think I'm overthinking it lmk
[16:47] <jcastro> maybe it's just me
[16:47] <mhall119> I think a separate app developer community is appropriate
[16:47] <snap-l> I think individual communities might help split the signal
[16:47] <popey> no, it needs thinking about
[16:47] <snap-l> not sure if it'll cut the noise.
[16:47] <mhall119> since many app developers only care about Ubuntu as a market, not as a community or project
[16:47] <snap-l> Perhaps if it was made private so it doesn't filter into the timelines
[16:47] <mhall119> but I haven't been promoting separate Ubuntu Phone communities
[16:47] <mhall119> since those rightly belong to the wider Ubuntu community
[16:47] <snap-l> but then private would have all sorts of negative connotations
[16:48] <czajkowski> snap-l: people over think private at times :)
[16:48] <jcastro> I don't want to solve a social problem with technology by making it private
[16:48] <snap-l> czajkowski: No doubt.
[16:48] <snap-l> Perhaps the exuberant ubuntu community would be an idea
[16:48] <snap-l> if you'd like to spew "I <3 UBUNTU", go there. ;)
[16:49] <SergioMeneses> morning!
[16:49]  * mhall119 likes to spew that
[16:49]  * popey mops up
[16:49]  * snap-l is glad he didn't choose the other word he was thinking of. ;)
[16:51]  * mhall119 got Ubuntu all over his shirt
[16:53] <jcastro> popey: hey so do you cron that btrfs scrub monthly or whatever?
[16:53] <jcastro> I just did my first one
[16:53] <popey> i dont
[16:53] <popey> mine is still running from 2 days ago
[16:54] <popey>         corrected errors: 11390321, uncorrectable errors: 0, unverified errors: 0
[16:54] <popey> \o/
[16:54] <popey> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1517215/
[16:54] <jcastro> 5.7 hours for me for ~6tb
[16:54] <jcastro> oh did you renice it?
[16:55] <popey> no
[16:55] <jcastro> oh, yours was correcting things
[16:55] <popey> yeah
[16:55] <popey> massively
[16:55] <popey> i think one disk has been loose for days
[16:55] <jcastro> so what happened did you remove a drive live or trip over something?
[16:55] <popey> the drive was failing, indicating hw failure or not seated
[16:55] <popey> so pulled it out
[16:56] <popey> then pulled 3 more out to make sure ;)
[16:56] <jcastro> !
[16:56] <popey> unmounted btrfs volume first of course ☺
[16:56] <snap-l> popey: chicken. ;)
[16:56] <jcastro> I am getting close to really needing raid5
[16:56] <popey> pulled all four out so i could label them and put them back in different places, so test if it's the disk or the slot
[16:56] <jcastro> I overbought the size of the disks to stay on raid1 as much as I could
[16:56] <popey> shoved them back in, mounted it, no problem
[16:56] <snap-l> jcastro: You're getting close to needing a data center
[16:57] <popey> no downtime
[16:57] <jcastro> nah, hp microserver ftw
[16:57] <popey> +1
[16:57] <snap-l> I need to look into one of those whenever I get some mad money again
[16:58] <jcastro> jono just txted me that they almost had mc hammer at the booth
[16:58] <jcastro> think about jono and vegas as you work all this week.
[16:58] <jcastro> let that motivate you
[16:59] <popey> haha
[17:00] <popey> 16:55:06 < popey> darkling: do you recommend doing a scrub periodically via cron?
[17:00] <popey> 16:55:32 < darkling> Yes, I think it's a reasonable piece of maintenance to do.
[17:00] <popey> there you go
[17:01] <popey> looking forward to hearing all the juicy details about CES next week
[17:01] <mhall119> popey: will you be in SF?
[17:02] <popey> ya
[17:02] <popey> leave on saturday
[17:05] <jcastro> popey: so other than some folks on the kernel team that tried it a few years ago, have you heard of anyone having problems with it?
[17:05] <jcastro> I want to do a talk at the lug about it
[17:06] <jcastro> but I'm not really seeing anyone being like "omg I lost data." it's more like "I don't want to try it because I don't want to lose data."
[17:08] <popey> people turn up to #btrfs and tell tales of lost data
[17:08] <popey> the problem is that the meme "btrfs loses data" has stuck
[17:09] <popey> every single time I mentioned btrfs at UDS someone said something about it losing data, every. single. time.
[17:18] <snap-l> jcastro: !!
[17:18] <snap-l> jcastro: Yes, please give a talk on btrfs
[17:24] <jcastro> I was thinking "btrfs for users"
[17:24] <jcastro> I can't answer questions about like, btree algorythms and stuff
[17:24] <jcastro> but I know how to use and consume it like a boss
[17:25] <popey> thats a good idea actually, I might do a talk at my LUG about it
[17:25] <jcastro> Oh don't worry, we'll have a G+ before I do it and compare notes
[17:25] <popey> "I use btrfs, and I still have my data"
[17:25] <popey> excellent
[17:26] <jcastro> I need to use snapshots more in my life
[17:27] <jcastro> popey: we should do them like the same month
[17:28] <jcastro> popey: that way if we have advanced questions we can be more efficient if we need to ping upstream
[17:28] <jcastro> popey: do a UUPC with chris mason pls
[18:49] <jcastro> mhall119: yo yo
[18:49] <jcastro> I need your web expertise for a moment if you have time
[18:54] <mhall119> jcastro: whats up?
[18:55] <jcastro> nm, I'll go email, I need multiple brains
[18:55] <mhall119> ok
[19:04] <JoseeAntonioR> marcoceppi: will you be around this afternoon to have a chatter on the Q&A thingies?
[19:04] <marcoceppi> JoseeAntonioR: What time, I've got meetings stacked for most the rest of the day
[19:05] <JoseeAntonioR> marcoceppi: s/afternoon/evening
[19:05] <marcoceppi> approx time?
[19:05] <JoseeAntonioR> 18 your time? maybe later
[19:05] <JoseeAntonioR> I'll be around all day
[19:06] <marcoceppi> I've got dinner plans around then so it'd have to be after
[19:07] <JoseeAntonioR> just highlight me when you're free :)
[19:07] <marcoceppi> Will do!
[19:07] <JoseeAntonioR> thanks!
[19:35] <jcastro> snap-l: lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWoQpzdB5gs&feature=player_embedded
[19:40] <snap-l> jcastro: Will have to watch it later. Am on work bandwidth
[19:45] <popey> ☺
[19:49] <AlanBell> hi cjohnston
[20:09] <cjohnston> hey AlanBell
[20:10] <cjohnston> is it possible to just switch out etherpad lite without any changes to summit? or does etherpad lite have other issues
[20:32] <AlanBell> it can just be switched out
[20:32] <AlanBell> the root url gets /p/ on the end of it, but that is all
[20:39] <cjohnston> ok
[20:49] <JoseeAntonioR> cjohnston: wouldn't that need a little change in the templates?
[20:49] <cjohnston> what type of changes?
[20:49] <cjohnston> I have never looked at lite so I dont know
[20:49] <JoseeAntonioR> I mean, if the URL has /p/ on the end
[20:50] <cjohnston> hrm.. its at the end
[20:50] <AlanBell> nope, there is a configuration thing on the summit object I think, the url for the pad server
[20:50] <cjohnston> AlanBell: do you have experience with the etherpadlite charm
[20:50] <AlanBell> not used the charm, I don't really get the juju thing
[20:51] <JoseeAntonioR> I can help if needed, I deployed it without problems last time
[20:51] <JoseeAntonioR> but didn't have the sso integration
[23:11]  * AlanBell spots a celebrity merge request in the making https://code.launchpad.net/~kees/libunity/remote-search-none/+merge/134180
[23:15]  * pleia2 offers AlanBell a seatbelt
[23:15] <AlanBell> I am staying well out of the way :)
[23:15] <pleia2> you and me both :)
