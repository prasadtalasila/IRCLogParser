[04:34] <pitti> Good morning
[08:52] <BigWhale> Good Morning all.
[08:53] <BigWhale> Who do I bug about pygobject? :)
[08:53] <BigWhale> https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692515
[08:53] <ubot2> Gnome bug 692515 in introspection "Differentiate Python created GType enum names to avoid registration problems" [Normal,New]
[08:56] <seb128> BigWhale, hey, you want to talk to pitti, he's the gobject master ;-)
[08:57] <seb128> gobject->pygobject
[08:57] <BigWhale> pitti, open hailing frequencies! :))
[08:58] <pitti> hey BigWhale, ça va?
[08:59] <BigWhale> pitti, https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692515
[08:59] <ubot2> Gnome bug 692515 in introspection "Differentiate Python created GType enum names to avoid registration problems" [Normal,New]
[08:59] <BigWhale> pitti, right now gstreamer in python is broken in Raring.
[08:59] <pitti> BigWhale: J'ai vu ce bug, mais je n'ai pas le temps cette semaine
[09:00] <seb128> BigWhale, do you speak french? ;-)
[09:00] <pitti> BigWhale: it was fixed upstream in gstreamer, wasn't it? if that blocks you, please feel free to backport this?
[09:00] <pitti> BigWhale: oh, sorry! somehow I misremembered you being French
[09:01] <BigWhale> ... :>
[09:01] <BigWhale> unfortunately no... :)
[09:02] <pitti> BigWhale: it's seb128's fault
[09:02] <BigWhale> pitti, there will be no updates from upstream to Raring? This isn't blocking just me, but everyone.
[09:02] <pitti> BigWhale: since he became tech lead, it's the official desktop team language
[09:03] <pitti> BigWhale: oh, I'm fairly sure there will be another upstream release in time for raring
[09:03] <pitti> BigWhale: there will surely be one for pygobject, and I'll deal with this next week after the sprint
[09:05] <BigWhale> pitti, ok, cool. This, looks quite serious to me (unless I'm the only one using gstreamer in python). :)
[09:07] <seb128> BigWhale, you are the only one using gstreamer in python...
[09:07] <seb128> or one of the few ones
[09:07] <BigWhale> seb128, makes sense ... I'm usually stuck with: 'nobody did this before' ... :))
[09:07] <seb128> BigWhale, if you can find the commit in gstreamer that fixes it we can backport it
[09:08] <pitti> seb128: well, once sessioninstaller finally gets ported away from sessioninstaller he won't be any more :)
[09:08] <seb128> pitti, sessioninstaller porterd away from itself, isn't that going to loop? :p
[09:09] <pitti> BigWhale, seb128: I think it's http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/commit/?id=d2b03a45371900e3100209b5fa4d3412b23aef94
[09:09] <seb128> pitti, danke
[09:10] <seb128> Laney, ^ is there any chance you could look at that and see if it fixes https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692515 (I see that you commented on the bug)? ;-)
[09:10] <ubot2> Gnome bug 692515 in introspection "Differentiate Python created GType enum names to avoid registration problems" [Normal,New]
[09:10] <Laney> morning ;-)
[09:17] <BigWhale> pitti, seb128 there was a reference to some other bug that supposedly fixed this ...
[09:18] <BigWhale> Oh, pitti found it ..
[09:18] <Laney> I got it
[09:19] <seb128> Laney, hey, how are you?
[09:19] <chrisccoulson> good morning evryone
[09:19] <Laney> good thanks!
[09:19] <chrisccoulson> hi seb128, Laney
[09:20] <Laney> hey chrisccoulson
[09:20] <seb128> chrisccoulson, hey, how are you?
[09:20] <chrisccoulson> seb128, yeah, good thanks. just eating some toast :)
[09:20] <chrisccoulson> how are you>
[09:20] <chrisccoulson> ?
[09:20] <seb128> I'm good thanks
[09:21] <seb128> chrisccoulson, toast with eggs and beans? aka english breakfast? ;-)
[09:21] <chrisccoulson> hah, i wish :)
[09:21] <chrisccoulson> toast with honey
[09:21] <chrisccoulson> i think i'd prefer the eggs (and bacon, and sausage, and hash browns)
[09:24] <chrisccoulson> hmmm, i really need to get a new bulb for my desk lamp. it's too dark in here
[09:24] <chrisccoulson> especially now the weather has turned grey and miserable again
[09:37] <BigWhale> Stop talking about food! I'm up since 4am and had no breakfast yet ... :>
[09:41] <chrisccoulson> hah, 4am is the time i went to bed ;)
[09:44] <Laney> yeah that patch seems to make kazam able to record screencasts again
[09:45] <Laney> I can't watch them back using totem for some reason though, and the colours are messed up in vlc
[09:46] <lufie> hi, es sieht so aus als hätte ich meinen ubuntu desktop getötet, mit dem versuch gnome 3.7 und gtk+3 zu installieren.
[09:46] <lufie> hat jemand eine idee wie ich das wieder hinbekomme ?
[09:46] <Laney> h264/mp4 works best
[09:47] <lufie> sry ;-) english again
[09:48] <lufie> it seems, that i have killed my ubuntu 12.10 desktop whit an gnome 3.7 installation and a gtk+3 / libgtk-3
[09:49] <lufie> any idea how i can restore this to default ?
[09:50] <lufie> currently i've got some gtk errors when i start some programms
[10:03] <BigWhale> Laney, well, I'll take care about reproduction later... and check if anything is wrong with recording in that matter.
[10:04] <Laney> righto. I uploaded the fix anyways so you should get it down the tubes in due course
[10:07] <BigWhale> Great! Thanks!
[10:08] <BigWhale> The amount of beers I'll have to buy to various at UDS people is quickly rising ...

[12:39] <Laney> seb128: heh, I just looked at ones linked from the topic :P
[12:39] <seb128> Laney, I dropped the workitem on the other spec and reassigned the one on this one to you
[12:39] <Laney> ok then
[12:40] <seb128> Laney, I've added it to the topic spec depends so it will show up there, sorry about that
[12:41] <Laney> oh I see, that's how they work
[12:44] <ogra_> Laney, lovely ! maliit !!
[12:45] <ogra_> even though onboard really really improved since UDS
[12:45] <seb128> yeah, onboard upstream is doing a great job
[12:45] <seb128> shame it's written in python
[12:45] <ogra_> well, you dont really notice the python anymore speed wise
[12:46] <Laney> I'd still use onboard for now ;-)
[12:46] <Laney> no arrows/modifier keys in maliit
[12:46] <ogra_> ugh
[12:48] <Laney> I do seem to be a bit more accurate / faster in it though
[12:48] <seb128> chrisccoulson, hey, looking to team workitems, wdyt about postponing overlay scrollbars and evo importer from your WIs?
[12:49] <chrisccoulson> seb128, sure, i don't have a problem with that
[12:49] <seb128> chrisccoulson, done! ;-)
[12:49] <chrisccoulson> thanks
[12:50] <seb128> yw ;-)
[12:57] <seb128> bah, dist-upgrade on my nexus "bricked" it
[12:57] <seb128> e.g I get a blank screen instead of X
[12:59] <ogra_> seb128, upgraded from what ? quantal ?
[12:59] <seb128> raring 2 weeks old to raring
[12:59] <ogra_> i didnt have any issues with yesterdays upgrade
[12:59] <ogra_> let me try
[13:00]  * ogra_ twiddles thumbs waiting for apt-get update ...
[13:01] <ogra_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1585822/
[13:01]  * ogra_ hits yes
[13:05] <seb128> ogra_, my Xorg.0.log has lines like "[    50.919] (WW) TEGRA(0): LVDS-1: Error querying display modes: No such device."
[13:05] <ogra_> normal
[13:05] <seb128> ok
[13:05] <seb128> well the system is running
[13:06] <seb128> I can ssh to it
[13:06] <ogra_> weird
[13:06] <seb128> it's connected to the network
[13:06] <seb128> I just have nothing rendered on screen
[13:06] <ogra_> we changed the screen rotation defaults
[13:06] <ogra_> but that shouldnt affect the display, only the input until the new kernel is in
[13:07]  * ogra_ reboots, lets see
[13:08] <ogra_> seb128, no issues here but i'm using the new kernel already ... though that only has a dropped patch in the touchscreen code
[13:08] <ogra_> shouldnt affect the display at all
[13:09]  * ogra_ tries something
[13:11] <ogra_> hmm, no, i thought it could be the rotated console clashing with X un-rotated, but that starts fine here as well

[16:10] <jbicha> cyphermox: I was looking at eds and the remaining diff we have with Debian is the symbolic functions filtering & having libeds depend on eds-common, should those be forwarded to Debian?
[16:11] <cyphermox> symbolic functions filtering?
[16:11] <cyphermox> I'm going to tentatively say yes
[16:12] <jbicha> it's in debian/rules
[16:12] <jbicha> it compiles fine without so I wasn't sure what it was for
[16:30] <seb128> hey everybody
[16:30] <seb128> it's meeting time

[16:32]  * kenvandine waves
[16:32] <seb128> I hope everybody is doing good
[16:32] <robru> seb128, just wiping the sleep from my eyes ;-)
[16:33] <seb128> current focus is nexus/mobile work, I hope a good bunch of you have work around that in their update ;-)
[16:33] <seb128> let's get started
[16:33] <seb128> robru, hehe, how early is it for you? 8:30am?
[16:33] <seb128> qengho, hey
[16:33] <qengho> Yo.
[16:33] <robru> seb128, yep, 8:30 AM, which I know doesn't sound too early for most people but I normally like to wake up at 10 or 11 ;-)
[16:33] <qengho> [desktop-r-chromiumbrowser-improvements]
[16:33] <qengho> - Cr v24 is this  "  close to being released for stable Ubuntus.  #webapps is verifying their patches.
[16:33] <qengho> - Slow progress on getting ARM (and therefore Raring) working.  scheat crashed last week.
[16:33] <qengho> - Dogfooding ARM otherwise.
[16:33] <qengho> EOF
[16:34] <seb128> still fighting arm then... good luck with that, let me know if there is anything you would need on
[16:35] <seb128> I'm sure we can find some people to give you an hand if you struggle too much with it
[16:35] <seb128> qengho, thanks
[16:35] <qengho> seb128: I would like another machine, since scheat is dead. That's one thing that would help.
[16:35] <chrisccoulson> i could probably help out there
[16:35] <chrisccoulson> or at least, could try ;)
[16:36] <seb128> chrisccoulson, that would be great if you could
[16:36] <qengho> thanks!
[16:36] <seb128> qengho, do we have any other porter box? you have a pandaboard/nexus, I guess those are not enough for what you need?
=== tkamppeter_ is now known as tkamppeter
[16:37] <qengho> seb128: I have a panda, but haven't had much luck in getting it running. Gave it 2 hours. Trying not to spend much time on it.
[16:38] <seb128> ok
[16:38] <seb128> qengho, let's sort the arm access issue out after the meeting
[16:38] <robru> qengho, I am also having troubles getting the pandaboard running. I can't seem to find the right image to boot it...
[16:38] <seb128> qengho, thanks
[16:38] <chrisccoulson> my panda gets extremely hot when I build firefox on it. i can't imagine what it's like building chromium ;)
[16:38] <seb128> chrisccoulson, hey
[16:38] <chrisccoulson> for me:
[16:38] <chrisccoulson> - Worked on a partner update
[16:38] <chrisccoulson> - Thunderbird beta updated to 19.0
[16:38] <chrisccoulson> - Been debugging some Thunderbird memory leaks
[16:38] <chrisccoulson> - Been tracking down an event handling bug in the current Firefox beta (events going to the wrong content)
[16:38] <chrisccoulson> - Tracked down some test failures that weren't occurring in local builds (thanks dh_scour/cdbs for messing up the test suites SVG's!)
[16:39] <chrisccoulson> also hoping to start doing N7/mobile work once i've got rid of current high-priority items ;)
[16:40] <seb128> chrisccoulson, lol at dh_scour, iz pitti's fault for optimizing that for us? ;-)
[16:40] <chrisccoulson> heh
[16:40] <seb128> chrisccoulson, thanks; looking forward having you helping on the mobile work!
[16:40] <seb128> Laney, hey
[16:40] <chrisccoulson> it took me a while to figure out why the test wouldn't fail locally :)
[16:40] <Laney> Thought/worked a bit on the default (l-s) fontconfig configuration last week. Called for testing on planet (test packages in ppa:laney/language-selector but none of you are ja/zh so don't bother ;-)). Turned 27 on Sunday (seeking walking stick). Worked a bit on enabling the gtk wayland backend. Had to iterate a couple of times but that's in now to please some sections of the community. Updated nexus 7. Won an easy 4M by killing ...
[16:40] <Laney> ... goa by default (the underlying bug is still there though). Now looking at maliit packaging with Quintasan. Should upload that to D & U tomorrow.
[16:40] <Laney> \0
[16:41] <mterry> Laney, have you picked a grave plot yet?
[16:41] <Laney> I'm getting blasted into the sun
[16:42] <seb128> Laney, lot of nice work, including memory saving on the default image, I like it! ;-)
[16:42] <seb128> Laney, thanks
[16:42] <Laney> np
[16:42] <seb128> kenvandine, hey
[16:42] <kenvandine> * Reducing memory usage of friends-service by creating a light weight service in vala that hosts the Dee.SharedModel.  This provides a significant memory reduction, on the order of 11x
[16:42] <kenvandine> * Finished up dual builds for qt4/qt5 for UOA

[16:43] <mterry> kenvandine, 11x!  nice

[16:43] <kenvandine> mterry, thx :)
[16:43] <kenvandine> python with dee... not efficient :/
[16:43] <seb128> kenvandine, great stuff, thanks
[16:44] <seb128> mlankhorst, hey
[16:44] <mlankhorst> removed 1 line of code today, testing reverse prime stuff
[16:44] <mlankhorst> eg intel driving nvidia display
[16:44] <robru> mterry, seb128: and that 11x is on top of the 4x improvement that I already did by fixing memory leaks ;-)
[16:44] <mterry> :)
[16:45] <mlankhorst> lts-stack landed in -updates
[16:45] <mlankhorst> looking good, blobs still need to land
[16:45] <seb128> robru, you guys play the "let's add some bugs we can fix later to look good" right? ;-)
[16:46] <seb128> mlankhorst, great to see the lts backport stuff getting in place, good work!
[16:46] <seb128> mlankhorst, thanks
[16:46] <mlankhorst> np :)
[16:46] <seb128> cyphermox, hey
[16:46] <cyphermox> hey!
[16:46] <cyphermox> - Finished up dbusmenu/indicator-session fixes for tests; so they now build daily
[16:46] <cyphermox> - I think we managed to get one daily build of libappindicator, but then tests are broken again, needs work
[16:46] <cyphermox> - Fixed bluetooth on the nexus -- wasn't getting the firmware downloaded in Raring, that's fixed via an upload of the uploader app (now in queue) that also ships a proper upstart job to push the firmware.
[16:46] <cyphermox> - MM catching and mangling tty of the nexus connected to a computer: fixed.
[16:46] <cyphermox> - Looking at why the getty for ttyGS0 is causing so many wakeups on the nexus
[16:46] <cyphermox> EOF
[16:47] <seb128> cyphermox, yeah for bluetooth on the nexus!
[16:47] <cyphermox> yeah, it's about time! :D
[16:48] <cyphermox> works great now, that's what I use almost all the time
[16:48] <cyphermox> just make sure the firmware tool doesn't die, but it shouldn't
[16:48] <tkamppeter> cyphermox, then one can use BT keyboard and mouse and carries less cables on the go!
[16:48] <seb128> cyphermox, it seems like dbusmenu didn't autoland in raring yet, do you know why (since you mentioned you got the tests fixed)
[16:48] <cyphermox> tkamppeter: yp!
[16:49] <cyphermox> seb128: no, and it's interesting because it's all blue
[16:49] <cyphermox> I wonder if didrocks maybe forgot to reactivate it
[16:49] <seb128> could be, and he's not here this week
[16:49] <cyphermox> (in doubt, blame on the absent)
[16:49] <cyphermox> I'll look
[16:49] <seb128> so if neither you mterry know, we should probably wait for him to be back
[16:49] <cyphermox> ok
[16:49] <ricotz> hello desktopers :)
[16:50] <seb128> (asking because chrisccoulson fixed a leak in dbusmenu recently, would be good to have it landing in raring)
[16:50] <seb128> ricotz, hey (meeting ongoing)
[16:50] <cyphermox> indeed
[16:50] <seb128> cyphermox, thanks

[16:52] <seb128> mterry, you know me :p

[16:54] <seb128> that was an hangout explained how to get the panda running
[16:54] <seb128> you should watch it ;-)
[16:54] <robru> seb128, ok, will do, thanks

[16:55] <attente> minor issue with inkscape (menu items are missing labels)
[16:55] <attente> making a workaround for this, but other than that can start taking on other work
[16:55] <attente> EOF
[16:55] <seb128> great
[16:56] <qengho> ogra_: I am IO-bound, I'm sure.  Panda is better than N7?
[16:56] <seb128> did anyone play with that yet? I wanted to try it before the meeting but got sidetracked, I will install the ppa directly after the meeting
[16:56] <qengho> I have class-10 SDHC attached to panda
[16:56] <Laney> I wouldn't know how to play with it
[16:56] <attente> seb128, i'm not sure if anyone's tried it
[16:56] <xnox> attach a usb external hdd.
[16:56] <attente> except for larsu
[16:57] <xnox> all sd-cards suck compared to spinny disks or real ssd
[16:57] <Laney> a quick mail with testing instructions would be good
[16:57] <qengho> xnox: thanks.
[16:57] <attente> Laney: sure
[16:57] <Laney> ♥
[16:57] <ogra_> qengho, a USB 3.0 disk will give you faster IO than the MMC in the nexus7
[16:57] <seb128> attente, inkscape seems to be a bit of a weird case, there is e.g bug #775702 open about it having issues with dbusmenu
[16:57] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 775702 in inkscape (Ubuntu) "Some menu icons missing in Inkscape since upgrade to 11.04" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/775702
[16:57] <qengho> Laney: Compose-<-3?
[16:57] <Laney> correct
[16:58] <qengho> Nice.
[16:58] <seb128> attente, good idea, if you feel like getting extra testing, maybe drop an email on ubuntu-desktop@l.u.c about it
[16:58] <seb128> attente, thanks
[16:58] <seb128> tkamppeter, hey
[16:58] <tkamppeter> Worked on a third size of printing stack for mobile: After the full desktop stack (which we had all the time) and the super-mini-1-MB stack (cups-daemon, cups-browsed, libcups2) I am thinking about a third, intermediate stack.
[16:58] <tkamppeter> The super-mini stack requires a remote CUPS server to provide the printers, direct network printing is not possible.
[16:58] <tkamppeter> The intermediate stack will have some filters to generate common formats like PDF, PostScript, PCL-XL, PWG Raster, JPEG and with an extended cups-browsed it will make IPP printers of the local network available automatically in a driverless fashion (no printer-model-specific data/software in the printing stack).
[16:58] <tkamppeter> It is more or less like the iPhone, where AirPrint printers are automatically available, without printer setup tool.
[16:58] <tkamppeter> This will work mainly with IPP Everywhere printers which will start hitting the market this year, but also with some legacy devices which accept PDF, PostScript, or PCL-XL.
[16:58] <tkamppeter> For the desktop the classic printer-driver-based method will stay available.
[16:59] <tkamppeter> I have also looked into the changes to be done so that printer driver auto download also works with the GNOME printer setup tool and also organized the transfer of a color laser printer from larsu to Marek Kasik, upstream developer of GNOME's print dialog and GNOME's printer setup tool.
[16:59] <tkamppeter> EOF
[16:59] <seb128> tkamppeter, ok, great, thanks
[17:00] <seb128> me: I've been looking at the nexus memory usage, e.g https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Smem-2013-01-16
[17:00] <seb128> reviewing blueprints/workitems, adding some to  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-r-reduced-power-ram from the issues/work identified
[17:01] <seb128> that's it
[17:01] <seb128> questions? comments?
[17:01] <attente> seb128: any work items i could take a look at?
[17:02] <seb128> attente, maybe look to the spec I just pointed
[17:02] <seb128> anything that is in state TODO is probably free to grab
[17:03] <seb128> just ping whoever is assigned to the item to check before starting to not conflict
[17:03] <attente> ok, sure, thanks
[17:03] <seb128> is there any type of work you would prefer? low level? ui? profiling? memory usage issues?
[17:06] <ricotz> seb128, hi, did you notice reports mentioning "Unable to find default local directory monitor type" lately?
[17:06] <seb128> ok, no comment it seems
[17:06] <seb128> </end of meeting>
[17:06] <seb128> thanks everybody
[17:07] <seb128> ricotz, hey, none no
[17:07] <ricotz> seb128, hmm, i see
[17:14] <seb128> jbicha, e-d-s run into runtime issue/gtype issue if build with bsymbolic, we need to keep that on Ubuntu, maybe we can forward a patch to debian that dpkg-vendor check if it's Ubuntu and modify the ldflags then
[17:16] <jbicha> seb128: maybe it would be fine for Debian too?
[17:16] <tkamppeter> cyphermox, when will the Bluetooth fix show up on the N7?
[17:17] <seb128> jbicha, like, just not needed in Debian, they don't have bsymbolic-function in their default compiler flags
[17:35] <lool> seb128: gnome-power-manager doesn't seem to use consolekit anymore; do you mind if I drop the dep?
[17:36] <lool> I guess I should do that in Debian
[17:37] <seb128> lool, feel free, g-p-m isn't do much anymore nowadays, it's mostly the ui which gives you details about your devices/their batteries and some stats
[17:37] <seb128> isn't doing*
[17:38] <ogra_> yeah,. it went on a lethal diet over the years
[17:44] <seb128> attente, thanks for the email, what about posting to https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-desktop ? or you don't feel like ready for feedback from more people yet?
[17:45] <attente> seb128, i could maybe after i get this issue worked out with inkscape
[17:46] <seb128> ok
[17:46] <attente> i'm sure there are enough issues with it for me to work through in the mean time :)

[18:11] <attente> mterry: hey, yep
[18:12] <attente> guess i should've mentioned that...
[18:13] <mterry> attente, no, I assumed.  I just wanted to double-check.  I might have a patch for it, to add support for exporting GtkMenuButtons if GtkMenuBar isn't found (i.e. nautilus and other GNOME 3.x apps)
[18:14] <attente> mterry, oh cool
[18:15] <mterry> attente, haven't started yet, but I may hit you up with questions if I hit one

[18:36] <mterry> tedg, is there an existing dbus API that I could export menus too, that would show up in hud?  (but not appmenu proper or anything)
[18:36] <tedg> mterry, No, there's the webapps stuff which is a bit different, but it's not generalized.

[18:51] <seb128> re
[18:51] <seb128> attente, sooooo
[18:51] <seb128> attente, you broke my chromium menus!
[18:52] <attente> seb128, sorry!
[18:52] <seb128> attente, lol, don't worry, just testing your ppa ... seems to work fine, out of chromium which became menu-less
[18:53] <seb128> works fine including firefox/libreoffice
[18:53] <seb128> which is quite good ;-)
[18:53] <attente> seb128, good thing i didn't email ubuntu-desktop...
[18:53] <seb128> I'm sure chromium does something weird
[18:53] <attente> i'll check it out
[18:54] <seb128> attente, well, people reading tech mailing list and optin for a ppa are usually people who like some actions, they are not users who will be screwed
[18:55] <chrisccoulson> 7,492kB/s, oh yeah
[18:56] <seb128> chrisccoulson, tell me that the "," is a decimal separator and not a thousand one :p
=== Ursinha is now known as Ursinha-afk
[18:56] <chrisccoulson> seb128, no, it's not a decimal separator ;)
[18:57] <seb128> not fair :p
[18:57] <seb128> I'm not even sure my wifi card handle that rate :p
[18:58] <chrisccoulson> heh :)
[18:59] <chrisccoulson> attente, does the new unity-gtk-module require the menubar to be visible in the window in order for it to be exported to the panel?
[19:00] <attente> chrisccoulson, yes
[19:01] <chrisccoulson> attente, ah, there's the issue with chromium then :)
[19:01] <chrisccoulson> the menubar is hidden, so it just doesn't have one outside of unity
[19:01] <chrisccoulson> they just embed a hidden menubar for unity, and appmenu-gtk didn't care whether it was visible or not
[19:02] <attente> oh..
[19:03] <attente> maybe we should all just use firefox :p
[19:03] <seb128> ;-)
[19:03] <chrisccoulson> attente, yes, that's fine with me ;)
[19:03] <seb128> attente, there is something weird with shotwell (we had bugs in the old dbusmenu world with shotwell at the start as well)
[19:03] <chrisccoulson> attente, as long as you don't report bugs :P
[19:04] <seb128> attente, if you double click on a photo in your library, is the "file" menu normal? it only has an "activate" item there
[19:04] <seb128> on that note, time for dinner, I will keep playing with that later
[19:04] <seb128> bbiab
[19:04] <chrisccoulson> oh, i see how the new module works now. i guess hijacking the realize call isn't going to work for chrome
[19:04] <attente> seb128, the menus seem fine to me, but i don't have any photos imported yet
[19:05] <attente> seb128, ah, i see it
[19:06] <chrisccoulson> i wonder if hijacking realize has any effect on firefox when it is showing its own menubar
=== m_conley is now known as m_conley_away
[19:06] <chrisccoulson> seeing as it creates a hidden window with a menubar in order to get style info
[19:06] <attente> firefox exports its menu over dbus directly right?
[19:07] <chrisccoulson> attente, yeah. but it creates an offscreen window with various widgets in it to extract theme info
[19:07] <attente> oh, interesting
[19:09] <chrisccoulson> attente, yeah, i bet that breaks theming when not running inside unity, as the widget doesn't have style data until it's realized, does it?
[19:10] <chrisccoulson> i should install this package and test it :)
[19:14] <bryce> cyphermox, heya, there's a couple WI's of yours on the desktop-r-arm-input-sensor-drivers blueprint.  I'm guessing you've already done the investigations, but can you update me on the status of them when you get a moment?
[19:25] <cyphermox> bryce: I got bluetooth to work
[19:25] <cyphermox> haven't got much time to look into the NFC and GPS -- I was hoping to pass those back to you, or work on it at the sprint
[19:26] <cyphermox> seems like both might need the help of that broadcom patcher anyway, so nothing's lost
[19:26] <cyphermox> the libraries for nfc don't support the pn544 chip afaict
[19:26] <cyphermox> so it's pretty much custom android work for this, but I did find some code with potential
[19:27] <cyphermox> as for GPS, it would probably just be a matter of testing with gpsd, it just might work
[19:27] <bryce> cyphermox, yeah we should chat with alex at the sprint
[19:28] <bryce> cyphermox, thanks.  If you can jot any notes down into the whiteboard that'll help us jog our memories at the sprint.
[19:28] <cyphermox> whiteboard?
[19:30] <bryce> cyphermox, the whiteboard on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-r-arm-input-sensor-drivers
[19:30] <cyphermox> ah yeah
[19:30] <bryce> (people have been jotting their findings there, so seems like the right place to capture these notes)
[19:32] <dobey> xnox: ping. i thought you looked at my patch on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-keyring/+bug/859600 ? did you not sponsor it? no comments on the bug and don't see a new version in ubuntu
[19:32] <ubot2> Ubuntu bug 859600 in gnome-keyring (Ubuntu Precise) "Please convert gnome-keyring to multiarch" [High,In progress]
[19:34] <xnox> dobey: yes, i looked / reviewed it. but no, I did not sponsor it.
[19:35] <xnox> dobey: i was hoping for slangasek or stockachu to comment on it, as they previously tried to tackle it and hit some troubles with it.
[19:35] <xnox> dobey: can you ping them, as they do not appear to be on #-desktop, but should be on #-devel
[19:35] <dobey> oh, ok

[21:37] <qengho> robru: I think I solved my problem with making the panda image.
[21:37] <qengho> robru: what was your problem with Panda?
[21:40] <robru> qengho, well, I wasn't sure if I had the right installation media. tried a few different ones; most wouldn't even boot, but the one that did boot, installed ok, but then the installation wouldn't boot
[21:40] <qengho> robru: ah. Hrmpth.
[21:47] <robru> qengho, yeah, no idea. I'm gonna look at it again in a few minutes here. just cleaning up some loose ends
[22:06] <qengho> Er, now raring-desktop-armhf+omap4.img is 22MB.  That doesn't seem right.

=== m_conley is now known as m_conley_away
[22:08] <qengho> Laney: yesterday's is closer to the right size. Maybe it's okay.
[22:08] <qengho> Laney: Is there a known good image online? quantal release, perhaps?
[22:09] <mlankhorst> precise ones? :-)
[22:10] <Laney> quantal should work, yeah
[22:10] <Laney> or if you wait until tomorrow raring ought to be fixed again
[22:10] <Laney> if you believe IS, that is.
[22:12] <ogra_> well, i havent seen any builds come out yet
[22:12] <mlankhorst> is bluetooth fixed on nexus 7 yet?
[22:13] <ogra_> even though the builder is up again since a while already
[22:13] <Laney> want to try a respin?
[22:13] <ogra_> mlankhorst, the fix sits in the NEW queue
[22:13] <ogra_> needs a review
[22:14] <ogra_> (the brcm-patchram package)
[22:14] <mlankhorst> I'm on raring :(
[22:15] <ogra_> i'm talking about raring
[22:15] <ogra_> quantal was a demo and is dead
[22:16] <ogra_> Laney, well, the build i started at 16:00 UTC is still active, though i dont see it running at all on cadejo

[22:17] <Laney> time for your twice-daily #is poke :-)
[22:20] <ogra_> heh
[22:21] <robru> qengho, yeah, a few days ago when I was trying this, all I could find were these 22MB raring images. The one I mentioned that installed ok but then wouldn't boot was a quantal image.
[22:21] <ogra_> well, first i killed the processes on nusakan, cadejo is still reachable
[22:21] <Laney> yeah, it was before, wasn't it? Just doing nothing because the FS was read only
[22:22] <ogra_> well, i couldnt reach it at all
[22:22] <ogra_> now i can at least get to it via w3m
[22:22] <ogra_> before it seemed to be hung hard
[22:23] <Laney> I thought I could lftp to it before, but I may be wrong
[22:23] <Laney> either way, sad panda is sad
[22:23] <ogra_> sigh
[22:23] <ogra_> well, its 23:23 here
