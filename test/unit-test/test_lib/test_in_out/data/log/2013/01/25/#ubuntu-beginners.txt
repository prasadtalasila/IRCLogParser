[20:04] <JonEdney> Im planning to build a new PC, to run Ubuntu 12.10 on primarily.  I've done a lot of looking around in regards to hardware compatibility.  I'm currently looking at an Intel i5 CPU, but due to cost, I need to downgrade that.  Anyone have any exp running on some of the Pentium or Celeron processors?
[20:46] <holstein> JonEdney: you get what you pay for
[20:46] <holstein> JonEdney: if i were not going to drop some cash on some nice new hardware, i would just get something used
[20:47] <holstein> i got a dual core box for free a couple years ago and maxed out the ram
[20:47] <JonEdney> yeah thats what I was assuming, but building is new to me.
[21:23] <userubuntu> hi I have a problem when installing ubuntu, my mouse does not work, during the installation and after that It used to work previously and it does in other operative systems. I tried some workarounds but I am stuck
[21:27] <holstein> userubuntu: you can really only search around, and try different live CD's
[21:29] <userubuntu>  holstein I tried to reboot Ubuntu from a pendrive (that is how I re install it) and the mouse is not detected. Previously it was but had some problems, so I decided to reinstall the version 12.04
[21:31] <holstein> userubuntu: if its not working on the live CD, it wont work
[21:31] <holstein> userubuntu: not "out of the box" anyways
[21:32] <holstein> userubuntu: what would i do? make sure its not a hardware issue
[21:32] <holstein> if it worked for certain in a verion of ubuntu, load that live CD
[21:32] <userubuntu> holstein it is not, I checked in other computer and it used to work previously
[21:32] <holstein> check the bios, check hardware switched
[21:32] <userubuntu> (albeit with problems)
[21:32] <holstein> switches*
[21:32] <userubuntu> ok will go to bios
[21:32] <holstein> userubuntu: you'll need to entertaion that it is one of 2 things
[21:32] <holstein> hardware or software
[21:33] <holstein> if its hardware, it could be a switch, or broken hardware, or disbled
[21:33] <holstein> if its software, it could be software support for the device is lacking in linux
[21:33] <holstein> those are really all the options.. you just troubleshoot and rule them out, one at a time
[21:33] <userubuntu> how can I see if the mouse is enabled through the terminal (as I cannot really use the mouse)
[21:34] <holstein> userubuntu: it is enabled in the terminal
[21:34] <holstein> userubuntu: you dont get a mouse in a terminal
[21:34] <holstein> you didnt "disable" it in a freshly booted live CD
[21:34] <holstein> so, you dont need to troubleshoot "did i disable it"
[21:34] <holstein> you need to determine if the hardware is working
[21:35] <userubuntu> ok
[21:35] <userubuntu> will got to bios
[21:36] <holstein> go to *any* live CD that used to work with it
[21:36] <holstein> take your current OS out of the equation
[21:36] <holstein> then, if it did work with that live CD in the past, and you are *certain* of that, then its safe to assume its either disabled, or broken
[21:37] <userubuntu> ok will try this
[21:39] <userubuntu> mouse work in bios so it is safe to assume it is not a hardware issue
[21:39] <userubuntu> and somehow it is now working
[21:40] <userubuntu> this is odd, but thank you holstein for your help
[21:42] <holstein> userubuntu: cool.. then you can move on to software
[21:42] <holstein> try a live CD, and take your current OS out of the equation
