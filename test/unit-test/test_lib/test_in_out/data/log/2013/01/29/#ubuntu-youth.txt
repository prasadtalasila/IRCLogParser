[05:44] <epikvision> Good evening everyone.
[05:44] <epikvision> Anyone attending Ubuntu Developer Week?
[05:46] <UnderControl> Epikvision Sadly not this time.
[05:46] <epikvision> :( why not?
[05:46] <epikvision> Have you done it before though?
[05:47] <UnderControl> I've done a session last year for it.
[05:48] <philipballew> epikvision, i'll be watching a few sessions tomorrow
[05:48] <epikvision> So will I actually.
[05:49] <epikvision> UnderControl, did you learn enough to contribute to development?
[05:50] <epikvision> philipballew, all the sessions seem worth the time.
[05:50] <philipballew> Totally worth it
[05:50] <UnderControl> Epikvision I'm not really the 'developer' to be honest, wouldn't mind to be one though.
[05:51] <epikvision> mhm, I'm not either, but i'm itching to learn the trade.
[05:51] <philipballew> epikvision, your gonna do awesome on that speech btw
[05:51] <epikvision> hey hey, it's too early to make assumptions. :S
[05:53] <epikvision> philipballew, did ubuntuyouth have any events lately?
[05:53] <philipballew> none currently. but if you want to help me we can do some
[05:54] <epikvision> sure, sounds like fun.  This group needs a little kick.
[05:54]  * UnderControl kicks #ubuntu-youth
[05:54] <epikvision> lol
[05:54]  * epikvision kicks #ubuntu-youth a little further
[05:54] <UnderControl> Uhh, I think I made it mad?
[05:55] <philipballew> lets talk about what we can do st scale.
[05:55]  * epikvision wipes sweat off brow
[05:56] <epikvision> I haven't thought of it yet.  Right now, I'm setting up irssi and screen for tomorrow.
[05:56]  * UnderControl orders Epikvision to use WeeChat and tmux
[05:58] <epikvision> I would...
[05:58] <UnderControl> :P
[05:58] <epikvision> but the retro feeling of irssi feels sooo good.
[05:59] <UnderControl> WeeChat is currently my favourite IRC client.
[05:59] <JoseeAntonioR> epikvision: I will be attending and helping with a couple (which are on air)
[06:01] <epikvision> JoseeAntonioR: you mean the hangout sessions?
