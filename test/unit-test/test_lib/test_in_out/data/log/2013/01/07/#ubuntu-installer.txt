[17:22] <kentb> does anyone know offhand if this merge request has a prayer or will design constraints prevent us from doing it? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1095692
[17:22] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1095692 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Hide the 'back' button on the first page of oem-user-config" [Undecided,New]
[17:25] <xnox> kentb: it's reasonable. we do want to pick this up. I think there were a couple of other places where the initial back button needs to be hidden (e.g. at the location selection, as one cannot go back to change paritioning after it's been started)
[17:25] <xnox> just needs time for a developer to review the fix, test it and merge it.
[18:13] <kentb> xnox: ok. thank you!
[19:44] <bdmurray> cjwatson: bug 1080701 has the debug log files you'd requested
[19:44] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1080701 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Raring) "After 'Preparing to install Ubuntu' screen, raring installation hangs" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1080701
[19:47] <cjwatson> Thanks.  Loaded but not enough brain to parse now
[22:47] <xnox> the best I got was a hang in close_dialog in replace recipe with a clean ntfs paritions and windows7 on it.
[22:48] <xnox> probably should make ubiquity upload which skips ntfs in ubuntu/replace recipe =/ but I am not sure of a fix. My next step is to strace it....
