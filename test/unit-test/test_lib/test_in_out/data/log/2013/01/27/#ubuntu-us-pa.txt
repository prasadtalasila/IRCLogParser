[13:51] <teddy-dbear> anybody around who can help me with a small problem?
[13:52] <teddy-dbear> I made the mistake of trying a different video driver and now can't change back because the panels won't load
[13:57] <teddy-dbear> never mind
[13:57] <teddy-dbear> I got the panels back
[14:11] <waltman> Glad we could help!
[14:13] <teddy-dbear> stupid 12.10
[14:13] <teddy-dbear> doesn't seem to matter what driver is in use
[14:13] <teddy-dbear> there is still a peoblem logging in
[14:15] <teddy-dbear> there is still a problem with my spelling
[14:16] <teddy-dbear> it seems the only way to solve this problem is to get grub up first
[14:16] <teddy-dbear> and not to let the computer just boot
[14:17] <teddy-dbear> that didn't work either
[14:18] <teddy-dbear> the log in screen doesn't stay up long enough to type the password
[14:19] <waltman> It must be tough to type with paws instead of fingers.
[14:26] <teddy-dbear> this is not working out well today
[14:26] <teddy-dbear> tried a older kernel
[14:27] <teddy-dbear> it booted but the highest resolution I can get is 1024x768
[14:27] <teddy-dbear> way to small for the screen
[14:30] <teddy-dbear> stupid computers
[14:35] <rmg51> I'm just going to have to leave well enough alone
[14:36] <rmg51> I was trying to get more then one choice in screenresolution
[14:36] <rmg51> not going to happen
[14:39] <rmg51> that just means I won't be able to connect to my TV
