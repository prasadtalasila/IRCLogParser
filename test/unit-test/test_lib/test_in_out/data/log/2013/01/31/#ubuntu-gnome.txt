[14:22] <ricotz> darkxst, finally there should be usable builds available now soon

[16:23] <jbicha> ricotz: what'd you do about the bumped nm dependency?
[16:23] <ricotz> jbicha, doing snapshots
[16:24] <ricotz> cyphermox said, he will update nm soon
[19:43] <britt_> hey guys
[19:44] <britt_> do we know when gnome 3.7 will be merged into raring?
[19:44] <darkxst> britt_, it wont be, they are sticking with 3.6
[19:45] <britt_> are we going to have it in the gnome-3 ppa, or are we sticking with 3.6 as well?
[19:46] <darkxst> yes it will be available from ppa
[19:52] <darkxst> jbicha, so 3.6 seems to run fine on the js/gjs stack
