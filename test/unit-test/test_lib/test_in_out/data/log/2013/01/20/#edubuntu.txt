[23:07] <oo-dragon> hello,  I have been searching all day trying to get my LTSP in Edubuntu (12.04) to auto mount windows user shares.  I think I need some help.  The main sources I have been going to are the man page for pam_mount and a older active directory integration (says its for 9.04)
[23:08] <oo-dragon> There are a fair amount of posts out there for this, but almost all of them are like 2009 and the ones I have tried just dont work
[23:09] <oo-dragon> Also I already have windows AD authentication working on LTSP using likewise-open
[23:12] <highvoltage> oo-dragon: I haven't done it in a while, but just to understand, you want to mount user home directories from windows when they log on?
[23:13] <highvoltage> oo-dragon: I'm about to enter a starcraft game but if we miss each other also try the edubuntu-users mailing list
[23:13] <oo-dragon> yea, so when they login to the LTSP client machines, they auto mount their windows home dir's to somewhere in their home.  like ~/Documents or something
[23:14] <oo-dragon> Starcraft 1 or 2? :)
