[00:40] <roasted> ate myself into another coma
[00:40] <roasted> seriously have to stop this nonsense
[00:43] <teddy-dbear> I do that with chocolate :-D
[00:45] <roasted> I do that with chick fil a
[00:45] <roasted> :(
[01:17] <roasted> man
[01:17] <roasted> why is deja dup so awesome
[01:18] <roasted> talk about a brainless backup system
[01:18] <roasted> ssh, samba, love it
[03:12] <waltman> I'm all about rdiff-backup
[04:53] <roasted> I switched back to regular rsync :/
[04:53] <roasted> I don't have enough space on my server to spare to house at least 2 backups, which deja dup does
[04:54] <roasted> I'll look into rdiff-backup, though... not very familiar with it.
[04:57] <roasted> loooks like rdiff's main difference is it keeps some sort of versioning history
[04:57] <roasted> sounds interesting
[04:57] <roasted> little concerned about space tho. If it keeps versions of all of my files I'll run into the same snag I did before.
[04:57] <roasted> My goal is to ensure that what is on my server is 100% what was on my client system, hence why rsync was a default idea.
[10:15] <rmg51> Morning
[11:20] <JonathanD> Morning.
[12:12] <waltman> roasted: It only keeps a full version of the latest version of your files. Everything else is a diff. Saves a ton of space.
[13:10] <teddy-dbear> Morning peoples
