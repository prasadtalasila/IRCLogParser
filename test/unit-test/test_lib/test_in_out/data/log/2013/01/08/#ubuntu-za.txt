[05:56] <mazal> Morning Squirm 
[05:58] <superfly> morning mazal, Squirm
[05:59] <mazal> Hi superfly 
[06:09] <superfly_> -_- gee, thanks again freenode
=== superfly_ is now known as superfly
[06:14] <mazal> hmm , starting to get very worried about the future of ubuntu desktop with all the talk that unity development is going to focus on phones and tablets
[06:15] <superfly> mazal: move to the dark side, join me on KDE, where we already have a tablet UI which doesn't interfere with the desktop UI
[06:19] <superfly> ...where we don't have people removing functionality and features in favour of "usability" ... where you don't need 3D graphics if you don't want it, while your desktop still works ...
[06:23] <theblazehen> what just hyappened?
[06:25] <mazal> Having lots of power failures lately :(
[06:25] <superfly> theblazehen: dunno, freenode is having fun again... it kicked me off too
[06:25] <superfly> mazal: :-(
[06:25] <superfly> mazal: where are you based again? Gauteng?
[06:26] <mazal> Yep , little Cullinan
[06:26] <theblazehen> superfly: that explains it.
[06:26] <superfly> little cullinan?
[06:26]  * superfly googles
[06:27] <mazal> Yep , Cullinan , i just mean it's a little town
[06:27] <superfly> oh, right... I know Cullinan
[06:27] <mazal> The diamond mine town
[06:27] <superfly> Yup, that's the one
[06:36] <Kilos> morning superfly and others

[06:50] <sharpey> eeek
=== sharpey is now known as Kilos
[06:52] <Kilos> pc just rebooted 3 times as soon as its booted past password
[06:52] <magespawn> looks like people are playing boomarang today
[06:53] <Kilos> then xchat cant get past my cloak host
[06:53] <Kilos> hey magespawn 
[06:53] <mazal> My problem is power failures , and the rest seems like the interwebs
[06:54] <Kilos> mine is like a power failure but power didnt go off. maybe ups playing around, 
[06:56] <magespawn> hey Kilos
[06:59] <maiatoday> hi all
[07:02] <Kilos> hi Vince-0 
[07:12] <Kilos> eek again
[07:12] <superfly> Kilos: overheating?
[07:12] <Kilos> removed ups
[07:13] <Kilos> whew i dunno superfly 
[07:13] <Kilos> will add outside cover with fan if it does again
[07:15] <Kilos> maybe time for a blow out again
=== inetpro_ is now known as inetpro
[07:21] <Kilos> yo inetpro 
[07:23] <inetpro> elo Kilos
[07:23] <inetpro> and hello everyone else
[07:24] <magespawn> hey inetpro
[07:25] <magespawn> there is no nefarious intent behind my router questions last night
[07:25] <magespawn> was just me being impatient
[07:25] <Kilos> Maaz, define nefarious
[07:26] <Maaz> Kilos: Nefarious \Ne*fa"ri*ous\, a. [L. nefarius, fr. nefas crime, wrong; ne not + fas divine law; akin to fari to speak. See {No}, adv., and {Fate}.] Wicked in the extreme; abominable; iniquitous; atrociously villainous; execrable; detestably vile. [1913 Webster]  Syn: Iniquitous; detestable; horrible; heinious; atrocious; infamous; impious. See {Iniquitous}.
[07:26] <Maaz> [1913 Webster] -- {Ne*fa"ri*ous*ly}, adv. -- {Ne*fa"ri*ous*ness}, n. [1913 Webster], nefariouâ€¦
[07:26] <Kilos> lol
[07:29] <Kilos> you a criminal in disguise magespawn 
[07:29] <magespawn> i have criminal potential
[07:31] <Kilos> hahaha
[07:32] <Kilos> we noticed it with the rhino horn
[07:32]  * Kilos ducks
[07:32] <magespawn> potential only Kilos
[07:33] <Kilos> lol
[07:44] <jrgns> can anyone recommend good IT recruiters? I'm on the prowl for a new position...
[07:51] <superfly> jrgns: you're joking, right? about the IT recruiters?
[07:51] <superfly> jrgns: where are you based?
[07:51] <jrgns> Jo'burg
[07:51] <jrgns> superfly: why would i be joking?
[07:52] <superfly> jrgns: because almost every IT recruiter I have met knows nothing about IT
[07:52] <jrgns> superfly: lol, yeah, that's why i'm asking
[07:52] <jrgns> superfly: I've been on both sides of the recruitment process, and generally recruiters make a mess of things
[07:52] <jrgns> superfly: but every now and then you hit gold
[07:54] <superfly> jrgns: I only know of one guy who is mostly competant, and he's in Cape Town
[07:54] <superfly> jrgns: are you on the GLUG mailing lists?
[07:54] <jrgns> superfly: yup
[07:54] <jrgns> superfly: what's his name? doesn't hurt to spread the net wide
[07:54] <superfly> jrgns: have you tried mailing the CLUG-jobs mailing list?
[07:54] <superfly> *GLUG-jobs
[07:55] <jrgns> superfly: not yet, it's on the todo list
[07:55] <superfly> though you can try CLUG-jobs too :-)
[07:55] <jrgns> hehe
[07:55] <superfly> jrgns: what sort of work do you do?
[07:56] <jrgns> superfly: started out as a web dev, but these days it's systems dev & admin, as well as some management roles
[07:56] <superfly> we're looking for developers, but we're in Cape Town
[07:56] <jrgns> company?
[07:57] <superfly> www.nomanini.com
[07:57] <jrgns> i'll check it out, thnx
[09:00] <Vince-0> Hi! *was afk
[09:23] <superfly> jrgns: have you played with Python much?
[09:23] <jrgns> superfly: not a lot, but i can read it
[09:23] <jrgns> superfly: tended towards ruby more than python
[09:24] <superfly> python doesn't have scalability issues like Ruby does
[09:42]  * Squirm yawns
[09:50] <Kilos> hiya kbmonkey 
[09:51] <Kilos> before lunch and all
[09:51] <Kilos> surely the skies will open today
[10:45] <jrgns> superfly: noted
[10:45] <jrgns> superfly: do you have a link to a writeup of said issues?
[10:48] <magespawn> inetpro and kilos i managed to get a console cable
[10:49] <Kilos> did you make it magespawn ?
[10:49] <magespawn> no went and spoke to the guys i got the router from
[10:50] <Kilos> ah
[10:50] <Kilos> they would have the username password too
[10:51] <magespawn> no that would be it department in jhb
[10:51] <Kilos> ah well hack it and put yours in
[10:51] <magespawn> that is why i said i was impatient they mailed them this morning
[10:52] <Kilos> hahaha
[10:52] <Kilos> im the same cant wait for stuff
[10:52] <Kilos> must try out immediately
[10:53] <superfly> jrgns: not specifically, that was mostly from friends who've had to deal with issues like that, but there's also the (in)famous rant by that Twitter engineer on how Ruby/RoR was giving them major issues
[10:55] <magespawn> brb
[10:56] <superfly> jrgns: by my own experience, Python scales better than PHP
[10:57] <Vince-0> python! whoot - I'm a fan
[11:01] <superfly> Vince-0: can you write any?
[11:05] <jrgns> superfly: kewl. my limited experience suggests the same
[11:06] <jrgns> superfly: but hey, don't let facts get in the way of a good conversation ;)
[11:06] <superfly> haha
[11:06] <superfly> jrgns: ever heard of Zed Shaw?
[11:07] <jrgns> superfly: nope. quick google says he created mongrel?
[11:07] <superfly> yup, you use mongrel at all?
[11:08] <superfly> maybe you use thin, the successor (i.e. "fork") of mongrel?
[11:09] <jrgns> yeah, used thin
[11:09] <jrgns> still a lot of resources for a single process
[11:10] <superfly> jrgns: well, a few years back Zed wrote a blog post called "Rails is a Ghetto" and moved to doing Python development after using Ruby and Rails for years - though his rant was more about the community around Rails, rather than RoR or Ruby itself
[11:11] <jrgns> superfly: interesting. one of the things that attracts me to ruby is the community. although, i guess ruby comm != rails comm
[11:11] <jrgns> i'll keep that in mind. thanx
[11:20] <Vince-0> superfly, still learning
[11:20] <Vince-0> got the #ctpug python users on atrum
[11:22] <superfly> Vince-0: you in Cape Town?
[11:22] <Vince-0> python is my ideal language, I learnt J2ee stuff in the past
[11:22] <Vince-0> Durban -
[11:22] <superfly> Ah
[11:22] <Vince-0> but I don't think there's many job opportunities for python in this country
[11:22] <superfly> Vince-0: there's also gtpug
[11:22] <superfly> Vince-0: we're looking for Python/C++/C developers
[11:23] <Vince-0> ah! I'm a linux/voip admin first - I've avoided hardcore progging for a while
[11:24] <superfly> Vince-0: well, if you ever feel like moving to Cape Town, and you think you're a good developer, come for an interview :-)
[11:27] <Vince-0> I lived in CPT and stellenbosch for 2 years
[11:27] <Vince-0> I guess the next logical progression after system admin becomes scripting/perl/python then progging web front ends for tools like voip - so Ima get stuck into some python
[11:29] <inetpro> Kilos: the skies are all open here, all clear and blue
[11:31] <Kilos> lol i mean open and gooi die groot water
[11:31] <inetpro> lol
[11:32] <Kilos> bossies begin weer hang
[11:41] <Kilos> lo hubx 
[11:41] <hubx> hi there
[12:18] <magespawn> superfly can programmers not tele work? do they have to be in location?
[12:18] <superfly> magespawn: for Nomanini? no,they have to be here, we do pair-programming
[12:44] <magespawn> bbl
[12:50] <mazal> Bye all
[12:50] <mazal> Enjoy the evening
[13:03] <inetpro> Kilos: waar's die reen?
[14:18] <Kilos> ai inetpro ?
[14:19] <inetpro> Kilos: ek's bly die son het jou darem nog nie helemal weggebrand nie
[14:19] <Kilos> hahaha ek was afk
[14:20] <Kilos> afk=sleeping
[14:20] <inetpro> ai!
[14:20] <Kilos> kop voel ietwat beter nou
[14:20] <inetpro> mooi!
[14:20] <Kilos> nou kan ek jou weer treiter
[14:21] <Kilos> ek sien doer oor die berg na kerk straat se kant so paar volke wat op bou
[15:34] <Kilos> strange hey superfly , pc aint rebooted again since ups removed
[15:34]  * inetpro wonders why Ubuntu chose to write all logs to just /var/log/syslog and no longer some to /var/log/messages these days
[15:34] <Kilos> somehow the faulty battery must be doing it albeit with another outside battery connected too
[15:35] <superfly> Kilos: you messed with the UPS? 
[15:35] <superfly> no wonder
[15:35] <Kilos> when i got it the battery was dead completely
[15:35] <Kilos> and wouldnt charge from ups power
[15:36] <Kilos> charged with own batttery charger then pur back\
[15:37] <inetpro> Kilos: ai!
[15:38] <Kilos> all i did was parralel an outside battery with it superfly 
[15:38] <Kilos> ai
[15:40] <superfly> Kilos: what battery is it? UPSes take special batteries called deep cycle batteries 
[15:40] <Kilos> that cant cause any harm
[15:40] <Kilos> i just added a car battery on the outside
[15:41] <Kilos> in parralel with the internal one
[15:43] <Kilos> but i know the internal one is faulty because it lost some charge when just standing
[15:43] <Kilos> but the ups is a horrible thing to open up
[15:50] <superfly> Kilos: don't mess with UPSes 
[15:50] <Kilos> what can i say superfly , already done months ago
[15:50] <superfly> they are dangerous 
[15:50] <Kilos> oh tell more
[15:52] <Kilos> dangerous to pc or me?
[15:52] <tumbleweed> replacing batteries with batteries of the same spec is safe enough
[15:53] <tumbleweed> but adding higher capacity batteries could cause overheating
[15:55] <Kilos> same spec meaning 12v?
[15:59] <tumbleweed> same capacity and current rating too (basically, a battery of the same form factor)
[16:00] <Kilos> and the overheating could only come when power gone and running off external battery right?
[16:01] <tumbleweed> from charging, too
[16:02] <tumbleweed> and obviously all safety checks that the UPS does are assuming an internal gel-type battery, not an external wet battery
[16:04] <Kilos> things are getting too involved. i thought a ups was just a battery charger with an inverter for the screens voltage added
[16:04] <Kilos> and pcs psu of course
[16:06] <inetpro> now why does all this sound like the source of many many problems he has had
[16:06] <inetpro> ?
[16:06] <tumbleweed> it is. But I don't think it's safe to assume that you can just add more batteries in parallel, to increase capacity
[16:06] <inetpro> ai!
[16:06] <tumbleweed> unless the UPS provides a socket for connecting an external battery
[16:07] <Kilos> i added some
[16:08] <Kilos> ran wires from the battery leads inside to plugin sockets i fitted in the casing
[16:09] <tumbleweed> I'd have disconnected the internal battery too
[16:09] <tumbleweed> most likely, that has a shorted cell or two
[16:09] <tumbleweed> they tend to dry out after a few years
[16:09] <tumbleweed> anyway /me -> dinner
[16:10] <Kilos> thats what i gotta do now . thought at the time it wouldnt do much
[16:10] <Kilos> ty tumbleweed 
[16:14] <inetpro> anyone here using drupal 7 and the syslog module on Ubuntu 12.04.1, and considering it a good idea?
[16:15]  * inetpro doesn't like how it pollutes the syslog files with many strange looking entries
[16:16] <inetpro> but I can understand how it could improve performance without having to write to the db
[16:17] <inetpro> the documentation is just a bit out of date at http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/syslog
[16:18] <inetpro> that is, if you want to make it write to a separate logfile 
[16:44] <Kilos> inetpro, what performance improvement do you get?
[16:45] <Kilos> hi smile 
[16:46] <smile> hi :)
[16:50] <superfly> inetpro: I've never bothered, I never needed it
[16:52] <smile> what do you guys think about Fedora 18?
[17:07] <inetpro> superfly: so you log to the database?
[17:09] <inetpro> smile: I haven't tried Fedora for some time
[17:10] <smile> inetpro: ok :p I don't like it very much
[17:10]  * inetpro is very happy with Kubuntu
[17:14] <superfly> inetpro: yes
[17:16] <kbmonkey> hi hi
[17:16] <Kilos> hi kbmonkey

[17:18] <Kilos> or am i mistaken again
[17:18] <inetpro> Kilos: hmm... oit's different
[17:18] <inetpro> Kilos: it doesn't reveal his IP
[17:18] <Kilos> * QA (~QA@8ta-151-159-112.telkomadsl.co.za) has joined ##kilos
[17:18] <Kilos> * QA has quit (Changing host)
[17:18] <Kilos> * QA (~QA@unaffiliated/kilos/bot/qa) has joined ##kilos
[17:19] <Kilos> oh is that what you getting at
[17:19] <inetpro> yebo yes
[17:19] <Kilos> whew
[17:19] <Kilos> but thats no my ip there by qa
[17:20] <Kilos> mine had a 4 in somewhere i think
[17:20] <inetpro> Kilos: hahaha

[17:53] <nastja> Kilos, We discuss the performance of Richard Stallman
[17:53] <Kilos> ah
[17:56] <superfly> ohi cocooncrash!
[17:57] <cocooncrash> ohi superfly 
[17:57] <superfly> cocooncrash: nice to see you, things going well?
[17:58] <cocooncrash> superfly: Yup, pretty good. Had 3 weeks off work (which was pretty intense until the end last year), back this week
[17:58] <cocooncrash> Had my first white Christmas too :)
[17:58] <cocooncrash> superfly: Yourself?
[17:58] <superfly> cocooncrash: OK, hopefully things are a little calmer this year?

[17:58] <cocooncrash> superfly: Hopefully...
[17:58] <Kilos> hehe
[17:59] <superfly> cocooncrash: going well thanks. Really enjoying my "new" job (been there a year now)
[17:59] <superfly> very few places you can write assembler, C,  C++ and Python all as part of your day job
[18:00] <cocooncrash> superfly: That's quite varied!
[18:00] <nastja> why do you communicate in English? and not in Afrikaans?
[18:00] <cocooncrash> superfly: Where are you working again?
[18:00] <Wraz> its like 6 here
[18:01] <cocooncrash> nastja: Ek is nie 'n Afrikaaner nie
[18:01] <superfly> cocooncrash: www.nomanini.com - so the assembler, C and C++ are all embedded, and the Python is for our server backend, running on AppEngine
[18:01] <superfly> haha, cocooncrash++
[18:01] <kbmonkey> echo "Happy Birthday Stephen Hawking" | espeak
[18:03] <cocooncrash> superfly: Sweet, looks really interesting
[18:03] <superfly> trying to get the guys to move away from using the SDK and onto a proper framework, pyramid specifically
[18:04] <Kilos> nastja, most of the guys on this channel are english speaking with afrikaans as second language
[18:05] <Kilos> you are the only russian
[18:07] <inetpro> Kilos: I was doing what?
[18:07] <inetpro> cocooncrash: wb, nice to see you here again
[18:07] <Kilos> inetpro, everything

[18:11] <Kilos> lol me wonders who is the forgetful one
[18:11] <Kilos> yeah musta been on holds and left pc lurking
[18:11] <superfly> kbmonkey: it's awesome, but also a pain in the rear end at times
[18:12] <inetpro> tumbleweed: are you or have you been involved in the Ubuntu mobile project?
[18:13] <nastja> Kilos, in the republics bordering Russia also speak two languages. Russian and native
[18:13] <Kilos> ah
[18:14] <inetpro> Tonberry: wb

[18:16] <Kilos> hi zeref with what
[18:16] <Kilos> kde?
[18:16] <zeref> hi Kilos: just switched it on, nothing
[18:16] <Kilos> oh my
[18:16] <zeref> not even power light
[18:17] <Kilos> uh oh

[18:17]  * kbmonkey holds thumbs
[18:17] <Kilos> switch on at the wall
[18:17] <Kilos> hehe
[18:17] <zeref> lol
[18:17] <zeref> quadruplile check, wheni plug in the power button, light goes on, but then switches off
[18:18] <zeref> :-(
[18:18] <Kilos> why couldnt it be something easy like a fresh kubuntu install
[18:18] <Kilos> no spare screen to test with
[18:18] <zeref> hope screen in not dead. have had it for 5 years
[18:18]  * zeref is attatched to the screen
[18:20] <Kilos> maybe thats the prob. you too close and sweated on it
[18:20] <zeref> :-O
[18:20] <kbmonkey> lol Kilos

[19:06] <inetpro> nuvolari: aircons do that
[19:06] <nuvolari> inetpro: but most cheap ones makes it more moist

[19:33] <smile> u2
[19:35] <tumbleweed> inetpro: no, as far as I know, it's internal to Canonical
[19:36] <inetpro> tumbleweed: ahh
[19:36] <tumbleweed> (although some projects like that are open to certain community members for discussion, but I haven't applied to be part of any of those)
[19:36]  * inetpro thought tumbleweed was good at hiding secrets from us
[19:37] <tumbleweed> (I'm supposed to be added to the ones that are relevant to the release, with my release team hat on)
[19:38] <inetpro> hmm... 
[19:38] <inetpro> I think Kilos will be happy about the following
[19:38] <inetpro> U2t
[19:38]  * Kilos waits
[19:39] <Kilos> ?
[19:39] <inetpro> looks like Unity 2D is making a return
[19:39] <Kilos> yay
[19:40] <inetpro> but not coming from Canonical
[19:40] <Kilos> can get rid of nvidia 173
[19:40] <inetpro> a pure community driven effort
[19:40] <Kilos> uh oh
[19:40] <Kilos> but then it wont be on the dvd right?
[19:41] <inetpro> Kilos: looks like it's still early days
[19:41] <inetpro> let's wait and see what gives
[19:41] <Kilos> not serious i got unity working with the 173 driver
[19:41] <inetpro> get involved at https://launchpad.net/u2t
[19:42] <Kilos> and theres always kde that works without it
[19:43] <Kilos> albeit a bit slower
[19:44] <inetpro> eh!
[19:46] <Kilos> oh and mate
