[18:18] <qwebirc13765> I'm having a horrible time getting my brand new HD-PVR working on a working mythbuntu 11.10 box. I've tried resetting, updating firmware, rebooting, you name it. I'm baffled. it works fine in Windoze 8.

[19:35] <qwebirc858> Thanks in advance - I screwed up. I was on an unsuoorted release and attempted an auto upgrade and now my system wont boot. I'm downloading the iso and will create a flashdrive boot. Where do I begin troubleshooting? Ugh.
