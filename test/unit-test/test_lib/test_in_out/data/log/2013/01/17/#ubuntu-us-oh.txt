[04:14] <gilbert> hey everybody :)
[04:14] <gilbert> Cheri703: we should think about another irc meeting this month
[04:14] <Cheri703> yeah
[04:14] <Cheri703> did you get my pm?
[04:14] <gilbert> yeah
[04:15] <Cheri703> k
[04:16] <gilbert> i'll get the election email started
[04:16] <gilbert> would you mind sending a doodle?
[04:16] <Unit193> Don't elect me, and you'll be good.
[04:16] <Cheri703> yeah, preferred days?
[04:16] <gilbert> ok Unit193 ;)
[04:17] <Unit193> Though I suppose we should pretend to have a local meetup.
[04:17] <Unit193> Oh, Akron area active?
[04:19] <gilbert> i dunno
[04:19] <gilbert> reloco activity has been concerningly low lately :(
[04:19] <Cheri703> yeah
[04:20] <Unit193> LoCos, generally.
[04:20] <Cheri703> we could just try to shift focus to having more online activity
[04:20] <Cheri703> vs in person
[04:20] <gilbert> Unit193: you've seen same problems in other states as well?
[04:20] <Cheri703> like doing google hangout bug jam vs in person
[04:20] <Cheri703> or stuff like that
[04:20] <gilbert> Cheri703: i really like the online direction
[04:20] <Unit193> gilbert: That was the conclusion of someone from another state. yeah
[04:21] <Cheri703> that way people can blog it and spread the word in various ways
[04:21] <gilbert> Unit193: do you know which state that was?
[04:21] <Cheri703> and it's easier for folks to pop in
[04:21] <Cheri703> I know colorado has similar issues
[04:22] <skellat> So, we're looking at a meeting?
[04:22] <gilbert> Cheri703: definately :)
[04:22] <Unit193> gilbert: tn.
[04:22] <Cheri703> I think focusing on having online events, getting the mailing list more active, the forums, etc would be good. way easier to have a "ohio bug jam day" and post to various local forums (non ubuntu-specific) or g+ or stuff than to mess with driving 2 hours to try to sit in a room and work on a computer :/
[04:23] <gilbert> Cheri703: agreed.  i think people fell less of a need for real-world interaction anymore
[04:24] <Cheri703> yeah, so I think that might be a good topic of discussion at our next "business" meeting
[04:24] <gilbert> skellat: yep, another irc
[04:25] <skellat> What's our educational/roundtable/discussion topic preceding the biz meeting?
[04:25] <Cheri703> skellat: we can put that part off til next month OR have it as a separate session
[04:26] <gilbert> who was going to lead that?
[04:26] <skellat> Cheri703: Well, I'm still unemployed so I've got all the time in the world to prep.  Can you put up a Doodle for a Joy Of BeagleBoard session?
[04:26] <Cheri703> you can make one too ;)
[04:26] <Cheri703> that way you can choose dates/times that work for you
[04:26] <gilbert> skellat: don't feel constrained.  go ahead without council approval :)
[04:27] <skellat> I kinda want to schedule it near the business meeting, though
[04:27] <skellat> Maybe day before or day after
[04:28] <gilbert> i think next week tues, wed, or thurs would be good for the general meeting
[04:28] <gilbert> like at 7 or 8
[04:28] <gilbert> Cheri703: does that time range sound good for the doodle?
[04:29] <skellat> Hmm...will people be able to tear themselves away from Bones and/or How I Met Your Mother on Monday...let alone Kevin Pereira hosting Let's Ask America?
[04:29] <Cheri703> yeah, that works for me.
[04:30] <gilbert> if not, i'm sure they can multitask ;)
[04:30] <skellat> :-)
[04:30] <skellat> See: http://www.letsaskamerica.tv/
[04:30] <gilbert> i'm in a weird joy division music phase right now
[04:31] <gilbert> what channel is that on?
[04:32] <Cheri703> link sent
[04:32] <Cheri703> and for those here: http://doodle.com/w3aipwvvys79rh3p
[04:33] <gilbert> thanks Cheri703!
[04:33] <gilbert> you're awesome :)
[04:33] <Cheri703> it's on the forum too
[04:33] <gilbert> cool
[04:33] <gilbert> we really need a bridge between ml and forum
[04:34] <Cheri703> yeah :s
[04:34] <Cheri703> might poke the higher ups about that
[04:34] <skellat> gilbert: We've asked about that bridge and poked higher ups.  Canonical holds the cards on that one as something's up with the software.  Heck, openID log-in to the Forum wasn't working last time I tried.
[04:35] <skellat> Cheri703: Here's link for the educational session: http://doodle.com/99swcya8pp5u2fpe
[04:35] <Cheri703> is that supposed to be 11pm and 12am?
[04:36] <skellat> Yeah.  It didn't show up right?
[04:36] <gilbert> either way those are really really late
[04:37] <Cheri703> I mean, if you want to do the session then, go for it, but...just wanted to make sure that was correct
[04:37] <skellat> Let me delete the  midnight one 'cuz that didn't go where I wanted it
[04:39] <skellat> There we go...I think I fixed it...
[04:40] <drkokandy> Sorry, just reading the earlier conversation now, but I think the idea of doing online events on G+ hangouts would be a really good idea too!
[04:41] <Cheri703> I just think it's the only way to have group activities with >3 people
[04:41] <drkokandy> might be, especially the way we're all dispersed around the state3
[04:41] <Cheri703> yeah
[04:41] <drkokandy> *state
[04:42] <drkokandy> not to end it by drawing attention to it, but this IRC channel seems to be more active lately too
[04:42] <skellat> Is there an alternative to G+ Hangouts?  We've executed a de-Google here and to the extent possible don't use their services.
[04:42] <Cheri703> and like if we do "x day" events, then we could have someone just keep the hangout open and folks can hop in and out through the day
[04:43] <Cheri703> skellat: if you can find a free, reliable, easy to implement, *buntu friendly group video chat option, please suggest it!
[04:43] <gilbert> i've never used google hangouts, so i'm really open to any option
[04:43] <Cheri703> it's one of few
[04:43] <skellat> Cheri703: I'll look into it
[04:43] <gilbert> what are the alternatives?
[04:43] <skellat> Is Ustream still around?
[04:43] <Cheri703> like...none? skype can do group video chat, but iirc you have to pay
[04:43] <drkokandy> I really don't know anything else that can do that kind of multi-video streaming for free
[04:43] <Cheri703> ustream is more broadcasting, not multiple people discussing afaik
[04:44] <skellat> I've watched the problems with Linux Outlaws have had keeping such working right.  G+ Hangouts can go haywire fairly easily too.
[04:44] <Cheri703> friend of mine is de-googled, and she basically made an "f***google" account and uses it to video chat...
[04:45] <Cheri703> yeah, I'm just saying: we need something that can do the same thing as google hangouts
[04:45] <gilbert> haha
[04:45] <Cheri703> not a broadcast, then it's just someone talking *at* people, not a group thing
[04:45] <gilbert> are there any free software apps that do that?
[04:45] <Cheri703> not afaik
[04:46] <gilbert> we could always use gobby for text collaboration
[04:46] <Cheri703> *action item* skellat: research group video chat options
[04:46] <Cheri703> ;)
[04:46] <Cheri703> we need more than text
[04:46] <gilbert> gogo skellat ;)
[04:46] <drkokandy> well we have the IRC for text "-)
[04:46] <Cheri703> we have 3 text options
[04:46] <gilbert> i know, but its useful
[04:46] <Cheri703> mailing list forum irc
[04:46] <skellat> E-mail me a reminder
[04:46] <gilbert> we'll text as in collaboratively editing meeting notes/code
[04:46] <Cheri703> yeah
[04:47] <skellat> Gobby...aren't we forgetting lernid?
[04:47] <gilbert> different workflow than irc chat
[04:47] <Cheri703> lernid never got off the ground iirc
[04:47] <Cheri703> at least, last time I looked at it
[04:47] <gilbert> i've never looked into lernid
[04:47] <gilbert> gobby is dead simple
[04:48] <drkokandy> oh, mingle
[04:48] <drkokandy> er whatever it's called
[04:48] <gilbert> lernid does have some interesting features - view slides in real time
[04:48] <skellat> gilbert: Problem is that it is hard coded to #ubuntu-classroom
[04:50] <gilbert> why oh why are all free software video options such a pain
[04:50] <Cheri703> YEP
[04:50] <Cheri703> hence the googlies
[04:51] <gilbert> anyone used cheese?
[04:51] <Cheri703> that's just like a photo booth thing
[04:51] <gilbert> oh
[04:51] <gilbert> nevermind then :(
[04:51] <Cheri703> brb
[04:53] <gilbert> would people working on a bug jam actually want to see video of the other particpants?  would an audio chat be sufficient, e.g. via mumble?
[04:53] <drkokandy> That's it - mumble
[04:53] <drkokandy> not mingle
[04:54] <gilbert> i actually already run my own mumble server
[04:54] <drkokandy> I know a gamer or two who does too
[04:54] <Cheri703> mumble might work
[04:54] <Cheri703> just have a u-ohio mumble server for general availability too?
[04:54] <gilbert> i would actually shy away from video
[04:55] <Cheri703> might be another option
[04:55] <Cheri703> yeah, fair enough
[04:55] <drkokandy> I wish there were a maybe option for Doodle... I might be able to do 9PM, but I'll probably be late. Should I say yes or no?
[04:55] <gilbert> yeah, that would be quite useful
[04:55] <Cheri703> I do think some things should be video though
[04:55] <gilbert> drkokandy: we don't have a 9pm option
[04:55] <Cheri703> might be for the educational session gilbert
[04:55] <drkokandy> I'm on the Beagleboard one gilbert
[04:56] <gilbert> Cheri703: i think video is more useful for things like the educational sessions, rather than collabortive sessions
[04:56] <gilbert> for those, i would go mumble+gobby
[04:56] <gilbert> +irc
[04:56] <Cheri703> fair enough
[04:57] <gilbert> ok, sounds like we have a plan
[04:57] <drkokandy> Or we could even have the presenter do broadcast on Ustream and the rest of us live on mumble and irc
[04:57] <gilbert> now we just need to wait for the next global jam date
[04:57] <Cheri703> heh, we can plan for a release party
[04:58] <gilbert> we could also have a random ohio jam
[04:58] <Cheri703> true
[04:58] <Cheri703> might be a nice "welcome to ohio mumble"
[04:58] <Cheri703> or something
[04:58] <gilbert> we do need events to add to our re-application
[04:58] <Cheri703> we should make sure to announce the stuff on g+ I know there's probably people IN ohio who don't know about Ohio
[04:58] <Cheri703> yeah
[04:59] <skellat> The educational session will involve at this round a slide deck and a text discussion with a partner taking questions via PM that will be answered
[04:59] <skellat> That'll mimic #ubuntu-classroom as closely as possible
[04:59] <gilbert> how are you broadcasting the slide deck?
[05:00] <gilbert> no audio?
[05:00] <skellat> Not unless a Mumble server was up and running.  Folks attending would have time to download the PDF from a designated site prior to beginning.
[05:02] <skellat> The text would be paced and questions would be taken via private message to probably stringedluthier who would be separately logged in who could read them to me so I could address them while we continued.
[05:04] <skellat> If we kept it strictly textual, the transcript plus slide deck could be posted to the wiki in whole at least as part of evidence for the LoCo Council
[05:04] <Cheri703> if you wanted, I could talk to the u-classroom people and we could just use that maybe
[05:05] <skellat> Maybe.  User Days are coming up, though, so it may be best to try that set up out of our own resources first
[05:07] <gilbert> bed time, later
[05:07] <skellat> Goodnight gilbert
[05:08] <Cheri703> just let me know. I can ask pleia2, I have an in ;)
[05:08] <skellat> Cheri703: Okay
[05:08] <skellat> I'll shoot for putting an outline together by the afternoon and then I may e-mail it to ya
[05:16]  * skellat needs to wander off and get ready for bed perhaps as he's fighting the flu

[22:39] <gilbert> hawdy everybody
[22:40] <skellat> Haldo
[22:41] <skellat> Today in Mogadishu-on-the-Lake: http://starbeacon.com/local/x1303520707/Drive-by-purse-snatching-at-Wal-Mart-is-investigated-by-sheriff-s-deputies
[22:42] <Cheri703> o/
[22:42] <paultag> hi-ho
[22:43] <paultag> skellat: they call that (when done with people typing on Phones in public) "Apple Picking" (iPhones)
[22:43] <paultag> people will bike down a sidewalk very fast and snatch phones from out of people's hands
[22:43] <paultag> or on the subway as doors close
[22:43] <paultag> very common in the city
[22:45] <skellat> paultag: If I ever get this bloody nominating petition done, the platform may change to simply: "Peace Through Strength"
[22:45] <paultag> interesting
[22:45] <paultag> that was on the GOP platform for years
[22:46] <skellat> I'd like to have more than 2 sheriff's deputies to look after the public safety of 5k people
[22:46] <paultag> "Peace Through Strength" appeared in the Republican Party platforms of 1980,[14] 1984,[15] 1988,[16] 1992,[17] 1996,[18] 2000,[19] 2008[20] and 2012.[21][22][23][24]
[22:46] <paultag> [edit]
[22:46] <paultag> ah yeah, wikipedia agrees
[22:50] <skellat> So, how are gilbert and Cheri703 today?
[22:51] <Cheri703> pretty good
[22:51] <Cheri703> going to have the first meeting of my 4 person electronics kit group :)
[22:51] <skellat> Cool
[22:51] <Cheri703> my brother, dad, friend, and I all got the same kit and we're going to work on them together, eventually working up to arduino projects
[22:54] <skellat> So, what are ya building specifically?
[22:54] <Cheri703> nothing in particular, the kit has projects to go through to learn various circuitry stuff and how to use/wire things. we're all novices at the electronics stuff, hence the kit :) it comes with a booklet and also video lessons online
[22:56] <skellat> Sorry to split guys...gotta get some stuff ready for dinner
[22:56] <skellat> Chat more later...
[22:56]  * skellat departs
