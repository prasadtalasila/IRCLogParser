[17:17]  * penguin42 wonders - do we have any way to mark an ubuntu forum post as 'omg don't do that it'll confuse the heck out of you'?
[17:17] <TheLordOfTime> penguin42, tag it if it lets you
[17:18] <penguin42> what with?
[17:19] <TheLordOfTime> "don't-do-this"
[17:19] <TheLordOfTime> nah idk
[17:19] <TheLordOfTime> other than respond to the thread i think...
[17:19] <TheLordOfTime> penguin42, is it related to a bug at all?
[17:19] <TheLordOfTime> or not?
[17:19] <penguin42> yeh, bug 1093946
[17:19] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1093946 in evince (Ubuntu) "Evince fails to open PDF files. worked prior to Ubuntu 12.10 upgrade [-WARNING **: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpoppler-glib.so.8: undefined symbol: cairo_mesh_pattern_begin_patch]" [Undecided,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1093946
[17:20] <TheLordOfTime> got the thread?
[17:20] <penguin42> TheLordOfTime: I've been helping the guy with it - he bodged a version of a library in to work around a NX problem as per the instructions in http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2081746&highlight=nomachine
[17:20]  * penguin42 is just writing a comment on the bug
[17:20] <TheLordOfTime> ah
[17:21] <TheLordOfTime> penguin42, are they manually installing RARING stuff?
[17:21] <TheLordOfTime> if they do i'm going to have a field day on that thread :P
[17:21] <penguin42> TheLordOfTime: I think their manually installing previous stuff, copying library files around
[17:21] <penguin42> TheLordOfTime: Please do
[17:25] <TheLordOfTime> penguin42, are you able to pastebin me the output of this on quantal: apt-cache rdepends libcairo2 (which seems to be referenced), and apt-cache rdepends evince (also referenced) ?
[17:26] <TheLordOfTime> i need that for my rant.
[17:26] <penguin42> TheLordOfTime: No, I'm on raring
[17:26] <TheLordOfTime> hmm
[17:26] <TheLordOfTime> crap
[17:26] <TheLordOfTime> any bugsquader: if you have quantal, can you pastebin the output of `apt-cache rdepends libcairo2`?  thanks.
[17:31] <TheLordOfTime> i'm still slightly hung over, but rdepends of libcairo2 would mean stuff that depends on libcairo2 right
[17:32] <TheLordOfTime> i don't trust my own judgement just now
[17:32] <penguin42> haha, might be best to wait before writing a rant then :-)
[17:32] <TheLordOfTime> just answered my own question
[17:32] <TheLordOfTime> askubuntu and ubuntuforums are useful
[17:34] <TheLordOfTime> and you're sure that thread and the bug you linked me are related to each other?
[17:34] <TheLordOfTime> before i hit submit :p
[17:41] <penguin42> of course not :-)
[17:41] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[17:41] <TheLordOfTime> well they need the rant anyways
[17:41] <penguin42> I'm only going by the reporters info; and he revered what he did and his evince works again
[17:42] <TheLordOfTime> indeed.
[17:43] <TheLordOfTime> the ubuntuforums thread just got an earful from me.
[17:43] <TheLordOfTime> and the forums council just received an earful from me about how they should make such workaround suggestions against policy
[17:44] <penguin42> TheLordOfTime: Well, people will always find a work around when things are broken for them; but as I said in the bugreport it's better to do such a hack with an LD_PRE_LOAAD
[17:44] <TheLordOfTime> mhm
[17:45] <TheLordOfTime> you may want to poke the thread about such things as well, although its in general help
