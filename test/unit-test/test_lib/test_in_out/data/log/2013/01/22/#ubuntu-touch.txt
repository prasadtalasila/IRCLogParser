[21:32] <sabotage> anyone know a recommended replacement for mtview in Quantal?
[21:33] <sabotage> or any other tools that report/visualize the number of supported points on mutli-touch screens?
[21:56] <bregma> sabotage, there's a number of tools that report the touches, I'm not sure if there are any visualization tools any more
[22:01] <bregma> you could try installing the frame-tools package and run frame-test-x11 and see if it's what you're looking for
[22:18] <sabotage> bregma: well, it may have to do for now, thanks
[22:18] <sabotage> I see it at least reports the "Number of Touches: <n>"
[22:19] <sabotage> seems to me that I had some app like mtview on a different device running 12.10 (upgraded at each release since 10.04 iirc)
[22:20] <sabotage> that tool would open a window and show visual feedback of the touch points with colored circles, the darkest one being the primary touch point input
[22:21] <sabotage> anyway, seems mtview was deleted from the Quantal repos and I can't find any similar alternative
[22:22] <sabotage> I even devoted a few minutes to building mtview from src, but alas, the utouch-evemu libs do not appear to be available in Quantal either
[22:23] <sabotage> and I've got better things to do with my time than descend into dependency "hell"
[22:27] <bregma> mtview worked by reading MT events from the kernel and displaying them
[22:28] <bregma> that's not really valid, expecially if you;re using the MT extension to X
[22:28] <bregma> unfortunately, as far as I recall, the visualizer was never replaced
[22:29] <bregma> although I definitely recall seeing some visualization tools, but I can't find them now, so they mau have been one-offs
[22:33] <sabotage> well, thanks for the reply anyway... that frame-test-x11 at least has a nice concise and easily regex'd output for what I need right now
[22:33] <sabotage> just not as pretty :/
[23:51] <sabotage> bregma: fwiw, I fumbled my way through the PyMT instructions and finally have a /visual/ way of seeing how many inputs are being recognized
[23:51] <sabotage> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch/PyMT
[23:52] <sabotage> missing from that wiki is the info that you must run as root in order to use the "probesysfs" input provider type
