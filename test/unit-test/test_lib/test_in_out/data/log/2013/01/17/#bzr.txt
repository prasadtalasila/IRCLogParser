[13:03] <LarstiQ> lifeless: is there any web frontend for testrepository?
[13:35] <jml> LarstiQ: I have vague recollections of lifeless making something along those lines.
[13:38] <jelmer> you can convert to junitxml, and there is a thingy that can convert that to HTML
[13:39] <LarstiQ> heh :)

[14:27] <mthaddon> hi folks, is there a way for me to get all revisions since a certain date from bzr log ?
[14:28] <elmo> mthaddon: yes
[14:28] <elmo> mthaddon: bzr help revisionspec
[14:28] <mthaddon> ah, thx
[14:36] <mthaddon> elmo: am I missing something? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1541688/
[14:38] <elmo> mthaddon: I think that just means there were no commits in 2013
[14:38] <elmo> mthaddon: try e.g. 2012 ?
[14:38] <jelmer> mthaddon: it's annoying, I think there has to be a revision that matches the date you specify
[14:39] <mthaddon> jelmer: still no output from "bzr log -r date:2013-01-03.." even though the latest revision has a timestamp of Thu 2013-01-03 10:32:11 -0700
[14:40] <jelmer> ah, hmm
[14:40] <jelmer> not sure then, sorry
[14:40] <mthaddon> interestingly, "bzr log -r date:2012-01-01.." gives me the the entire log (oldest revno is 2012-03-26)
[14:41] <jelmer> Vila: do you know perhaps?
[14:43] <vila> mthaddon, jelmer: out of the blue, I'd say -rdate:2013-01-03 evaluates to 2013-01-03 23:59:59 which is after the last rev ?
[14:44] <mthaddon> vila: I've tried it with 2013-01-01 and it's still empty - I think it's because the merged revision is from 2012-11-30, so it's using that rather than the date it was actually merged
[14:45] <jelmer> ah, hmm
[14:45] <mthaddon> nope, not that either...
[14:45] <mthaddon> "bzr log -r date:2012-11-29.." also empty
[14:46] <mthaddon> have to go back to "bzr log -r date:2012-10-04.." to get any output
[14:46] <LarstiQ> mthaddon: before:date:2012-11-29?
[14:46] <LarstiQ> hmm
[14:48] <xnox> what is the date of the for last commit?
[14:48] <xnox> also did you add -n0 to the log command?
[14:49]  * xnox thought date: resolves to the first commit after the specified date.
[14:49] <mthaddon> the last commit is from "Thu 2013-01-03 10:32:11 -0700" - I'm not adding -n0
[14:50] <xnox> and the one before? (forelast)
[14:51] <mthaddon> Thu 2012-10-04 13:14:32 +0100
[14:52] <mthaddon> it's like it's ignoring the last one for some reason
[14:55] <vila> mthaddon: looks like a regression introduced in 2.5 :-( 2.4 gives the expected behavior, can you file a bug ?
[14:55] <vila> mthaddon: you're using 2.5 or 2.6 right ?
[14:55] <mthaddon> 2.6.0~beta2-0ubuntu1
[14:56] <mthaddon> vila: will do, thanks
[15:09] <mthaddon`> vila: any ideas how long it'd take to fix? - wondering whether to work around it for my use case, or if it'll just be a few days or so
[15:13] <LarstiQ> vila: are you still using dvc?
[15:13]  * LarstiQ is annoyed by windows jumping around
[15:14] <vila> mthaddon`: no idea, get in touch with the lp team that is responsible for bzr maintenance :-/
[15:15] <mthaddon`> vila: ok, thx
[15:15] <vila> LarstiQ: yes, still using dvc, no window jumping here though, which windows ?
[15:18] <LarstiQ> vila: I have a dvc-status and a regular file side by side. Hitting c in dvc-status throws up a log-edit buffer in the non-dvc window. ^C^C and the windows swap, now with a dvc-commit buffer in the non-dvc-status window
[15:18] <LarstiQ> Hitting q there gets me back to my file
[15:23] <vila> LarstiQ: wow, I never type anything in dvc-status, I'm always in dvc-diff instead
[15:23] <LarstiQ> vila: maybe I need to learn that :)
[15:24] <vila> LarstiQ: and I use 'bzr add RightPath' rather than adding from dvc-status (which I use only as a check)
[15:26] <LarstiQ> vila: ah right, I forgot you can run a shell in emacs
[15:27] <vila> LarstiQ: where else can you run a shell ? (Sorry couldn't resist)
[15:27] <LarstiQ> vila: :)
[15:29] <vila> LarstiQ: and by the way C-H m says that 'c' in dvc-status indeed calls dvc-log-edit, if you want to go to the file your cursor is on, just hit return
[15:30] <LarstiQ> vila: ah but dvc-log-edit is what I want
[15:31] <LarstiQ> or think I want :)
[15:32] <vila> LarstiQ: what does dvc-log-edit ?
[15:32] <LarstiQ> vila: prompt me for a commit message, and then commit
[15:33] <vila> oh crap, yeah, that's what I use
[15:33] <vila> meh, then I C-c C-c and that commits...
[15:34] <vila> LarstiQ: sorry, I thought you were seeing a different workflow
[15:35] <vila> LarstiQ: ok, I understand your concern
[15:36] <vila> LarstiQ: the thing is, it's wired for me: after a commit I get the *dvc-commit* buffer, check that all went well and hit one of my shortcuts to get back to my file, I didn't even realize I was doing that
[15:36] <vila> LarstiQ: i.e. I don't hit 'q' in the *dvc-commit* window which is where I lost track of your experience
[15:37] <LarstiQ> vila: aha!
[15:37]  * LarstiQ tries that workflow
[15:41] <LarstiQ> vila: hmja, at the point I commit with ^C^C the windows already swap.
[15:41]  * LarstiQ tries looking at the dvc code again.
[15:43] <vila> LarstiQ: yeah, they swap here too and that's not ideal, but dvc-diff (which is lost) is one the commands I use the most so it's also bound and wired ;)
[15:43] <LarstiQ> right
[15:43] <vila> LarstiQ: but you're right, that's worth fixing !
[15:43] <LarstiQ> vila: next question, if I'm not bothering you too much, can dvc-diff show things in ediff mode (by default)?
[15:44]  * LarstiQ finds the plain emacs diff mode unreadable
[15:47] <vila> LarstiQ: but ediff requires two buffers for each file plus a control one.. How would that work for a whole tree ?
[15:47] <LarstiQ> vila: hmm. Wonder what magit uses then
[15:48]  * LarstiQ is still quite getting to grips with emacs
[15:49] <vila> LarstiQ: I may be misunderstanding again, what difference are you talking about ? ediff shows diffs *inside* the lines two, is that what you're after ?
[15:51] <vila> s/two/too/ I hate that tyop more than the others ;)
[15:52] <LarstiQ> vila: that, and highlighting of the hunks
[15:52]  * LarstiQ has figured out how to make it stop wrapping lines
[15:53] <LarstiQ> although that resets on refresh, hmm
[15:55] <vila> LarstiQ: what kind of highlighting ? I have some tweaks locally, so old I had to check if they were where I thought
[15:56] <vila> LarstiQ: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1541850/
[15:56] <vila> LarstiQ: not ediff, but readable enough for me
[15:56] <LarstiQ> vila: cheers!

[22:14] <Noldorin> how do i configure the commit message editor??
[22:17] <Noldorin> anyone?
[22:41] <bob2> what would you guess the answer to be?
[22:45] <lifeless> Noldorin: there is an environment variable you can set
[22:45] <lifeless> Noldorin: its in the docs
[22:45] <Noldorin> lifeless, the docs also say i can use "bzr config editor=vim" to set it
[22:45] <Noldorin> but that doesn't work...
[22:46] <lifeless> hmm, thats since my time, I don't know anything about the new config stuff
[22:52] <bob2> export VISUAL=vim
