[18:02] <qwebirc34971> Hello. I am building a mythbuntu backend vm and I would like some advice on which hardware works well. I need to have a tuner that supports basic cable analog and digital signals. It has to be pci or network based. Which devices have painless setups?
[18:20] <rhpot1991> qwebirc34971: analog really?
[18:20] <qwebirc34971> YES!
[18:21] <rhpot1991> your area hasn't converted to all digital yet?
[18:21] <qwebirc34971> They don't want to pay for a digital cable package and tv tuner card
[18:21] <qwebirc34971> It's digital cable, not terrestrial ATSC
[18:21] <qwebirc34971> so they still run analog channels over the coaxial lines
[18:21] <rhpot1991> ya most places have forced digital already I though
[18:22] <rhpot1991> and then give out DTAs so you can still use your analog tvs
[18:22] <qwebirc34971> Don't get me wrong, Cox has some ClearQAM channels, but only about 5, compared to the 80 or so basic analog cable channels
[18:22] <rhpot1991> are they cable card friendly?
[18:23] <qwebirc34971> You need a digital cable package which is about 40 dollars a month extra and a cablecard to tune to a better package
[18:23] <rhpot1991> oh so you don't have access to that currently then?
[18:23] <qwebirc34971> They are, I have my own setup with a HDHR prime and a cablecard, works beautifully, but the folks don't want to pay more for their tv
[18:23] <qwebirc34971> Different locations

[18:24] <rhpot1991> cvance: ah ok, prime is where I was headed
[18:24] <cvance> I have one, but prime only does clearqam and they want stuff on analog
[18:24] <rhpot1991> there are some happuage cards that can do analog and clear qam
[18:24] <cvance> I heard they're not really painless...
[18:25] <cvance> I did a only Happuage 1600 setup for my fiancee a while ago
[18:25] <rhpot1991> they are supposed to work
[18:25] <rhpot1991> ya 1600 rings a bell
[18:25] <rhpot1991> 2200 maybe
[18:25] <cvance> yeah, i think they need hardware mpeg2 encoders or something, any experience?
[18:25] <rhpot1991> cvance: another option would be regular hdhr
[18:25] <rhpot1991> with mine I can do clear qam and all the dta channels
[18:25] <rhpot1991> which is my 1-70
[18:25] <cvance> that do analog as well?
[18:25] <rhpot1991> though in theory those may go away at some point
[18:26] <rhpot1991> no, comcast broadcasts them in the clear after the conversion
[18:26] <rhpot1991> so depends on your provider
[18:26] <cvance> dta? sorry not familiar with that acronym
[18:26] <cvance> I have cox communications down in new orleans
[18:26] <rhpot1991> http://www.dslreports.com/faq/16218
[18:26] <cvance> http://ww2.cox.com/residential/neworleans/tv/channel-lineup.cox look at starter tv
[18:27] <rhpot1991> what comcast did is they said no more analog then gave out little boxes to be able to get your old analog channels for free stil
[18:27] <cvance> not sure if cox does that, sounds pretty nice of comcast. Is it hd?
[18:28] <rhpot1991> nope
[18:28] <cvance> I know for sure that cox hasn't cut of analog yet because this old tv that we've got is still running with no box
[18:28] <cvance> I'll look into a 1600 or 2200
[18:29] <cvance> Yeah, if they wanted a digital package and a CC, would work swimmingly, but alas no.
[18:31] <cvance> thx for the advice rhpot1991
[18:32] <rhpot1991> no problem, good luck
