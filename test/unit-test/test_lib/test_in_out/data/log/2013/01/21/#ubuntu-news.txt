[02:24] <pleia2> so is it just the one thank you from leann?
[02:49] <pleia2> was there anything else special happening with this issue?
[02:52] <pleia2> sending this off to the editors, at least they can get the basic editing done of summaries, even if we have more to add :)
[03:11] <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2: we were supposed to have interviews and quotes and so, but nothing else yet
[03:11] <JoseeAntonioR> akgraner: ^
[05:13] <skellat> Burning Circle 98 is up: http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/node/131
[05:16] <JoseeAntonioR> skellat: thanks for the heads up!
[07:42] <dholbach> good morning
[12:45] <akgraner> pleia2, I have people sending me some quotes this morning
[12:46] <akgraner> and I have a blurb I'll finishing this morning.
[13:39] <akgraner> Just got Jane's quote - :-)
[13:41] <akgraner> I'm adding them here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ZbtFHQq6uMj7iuRLd11VH8V5Uc_FA0IfgiRUcbMbQk/edit  for now
[13:43] <smartboyhw> akgraner, who can send quotes?
[13:43] <akgraner> Anyone :-) I'm just hounding the canonical people at the moment :-)  Most have been at Sprints and just needed reminding
[13:44] <smartboyhw> akgraner, can I have one then:P
[13:44] <smartboyhw> LOL (considering I am not an Ubuntu member (yet))
[13:46] <akgraner> smartboyhw, what you mean you want to contribute a quote about the 300th Issue milestone?
[13:46] <akgraner> If so the quote should answer the following:
[13:47] <akgraner> [Q] What do section do you read first and why?
[13:47] <akgraner> [Q] When you think about UWN and what it represents what comes to
[13:47] <akgraner> mind?  How you you feel UWN benefits the Ubuntu and F/LOSS
[13:47] <akgraner> communities?
[13:47] <akgraner> [Q] What would you like to say to the Ubuntu News team on this 300th Issue?
[13:49] <smartboyhw> akgraner, ok let me type it out onto a paste.ubuntu.com
[13:51] <akgraner> ok or you can email it to me - akgraner@ubuntu.com
[14:05] <smartboyhw> akgraner, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1555530/
[14:06] <akgraner> Thanks   - will look in a moment - on the phone
[14:32] <smartboyhw> akgraner, BTW: http://fridge.ubuntu.com/calendars/ why is the Ubuntu Release Calendar empty? I thought it was supposed to be with the 13.04 release dates..
[14:33] <akgraner> smartboyhw, I have no idea  - will look into later :-)
[15:24] <akgraner> smartboyhw,  - I'll take the action to get that updated and discuss with the release folks about maintaining it.  Kate isn't with Canonical anymore and I used to work with her on that so let me find the new POC and we'll get it fixed. Sorry for any confusion.
[16:31] <akgraner> I've moved all the quotes we've gotten so far to the wiki
[16:32] <akgraner> pleia2, ^^^ I'm hoping to get a couple more but if you need to publish no worries I'll tell them to post about it and link to this issue
[17:18] <pleia2> akgraner: thanks!
[17:19] <pleia2> working on stats now
