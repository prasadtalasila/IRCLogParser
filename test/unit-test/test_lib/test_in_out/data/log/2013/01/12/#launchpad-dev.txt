[02:03] <plomme> I've got a quick newbie question. Got my launchpad.dev running  and upon registering I'm asked for an email but nothing seems to work? maybe I'm missing something really obvious
[02:03] <plomme> any help would be appreciated
[02:30] <plomme> nvm I got it
[03:00] <wgrant> plomme: admin@canonical.com, test@canonical.com and nopriv@canonical.com are the three most useful accounts.
