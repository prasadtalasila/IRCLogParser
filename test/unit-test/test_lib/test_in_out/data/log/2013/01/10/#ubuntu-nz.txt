[00:28] <ibeardslee> yeah
[01:24] <ibeardslee> one of the list of things I have is to be able to bring a single power cable into my wooden radio media player thingy and have a power supply that will supply all devices .. without having a multibox and power adapters pluging into that
[02:31] <hads> ibeardslee: This one? http://nicegear.co.nz/cables-connectors/21mm-to-17mm-dc-jack-adapter/
[02:41] <ibeardslee> the hardkernel website says it is 'inner diameter 0.8mm and outer diameter 2.5mm'
[03:10] <elky> hmm.. does the power supply from your desk phone fit?
[03:12] <ibeardslee> haven't tried .. as I looked at that link I thought that I should check some of the other adapters I have floating around.
[03:16] <ibeardslee> Normally ODROID-X2 consumes about 1A in most cases. But it can go up to 3A if you use some USB hard disk drives in parallel.
[03:16] <ibeardslee> We recommend 5V 2A or 3A adaptor. Inner diameter is 0.8mm, outer diameter is 2.5mm. Center is Positiver an Outer is Negative.
