[00:02] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: what's from sourceforge?
[00:02] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: I'm about to go to bed but can verify things in the morning
[00:02] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: sure, good night
[00:05] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: kolab is at http://git.kolab.org/libkolab - but as both kolab and kolabxml have watch files you can just use uscan/uupdate to fetch the new versions
[00:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so is this page outdated http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html
[00:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: whats the time now? here it us 5 37 am
[00:10] <yofel_> bah, great time for a connection reset
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[00:10] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: kolab is at http://git.kolab.org/libkolab - but as both kolab and kolabxml have watch files you can just use uscan/uupdate to fetch the new versions
[00:10] <yofel> (in case you didn't get it)
[00:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am going through it right now
[00:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: Do you have some time to guide me now
[00:11] <yofel> a few minutes, then I'm off to bed too
[00:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I am trying to compile freeimage from here freeimage
[00:13] <phoenix_firebrd> oops
[00:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html
[00:14] <yofel> hm, we usually just sync that from debian
[00:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can you walkthrough for compiling a single package for the first time?
[00:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: if its too late, i can wait till tomorrow
[00:17] <yofel> will have to wait then. But maybe someone else can answer a question or two
[00:18] <allee> phoenix_firebrd: I cd to the package source and do debuild -us -uc
[00:18] <phoenix_firebrd> allee: we dont need bazaar?
[00:18] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: do you need freeimage for something? Otherwise kolab would be more helpful currently (library packages are a bit tricky in general for beginners though)
[00:18] <allee> phoenix_firebrd: ah, one step back ;-)
[00:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok, i will start with kolab
[00:19] <allee> phoenix_firebrd: rename the tar file so it ends  <name>_<ver>.orig.tar.gz
[00:19] <allee> or .bz
[00:19] <phoenix_firebrd> allee: wait i will clone first
[00:20] <yofel> that, or let uscan and uudate do the initial updating
[00:20] <yofel> *uupdate
[00:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[00:21] <yofel> hm, do we even have  branches for kolab...
[00:21] <allee> I doubt
[00:21] <yofel> nope
[00:22] <allee> KDAP dudes did pkging for debian.  So there should be something already ...
[00:22] <phoenix_firebrd> whats the syntax for uupdate
[00:22] <yofel> we have kolab 0.2.1, can be updated to 0.4.1
[00:23] <yofel> but I don't see anything in debian so far
[00:23] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: sec
[00:24] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: if you've unpackaged the old package and ran uscan, then "uupdate ../libkolab_0.4.1.orig.tar.gz"
[00:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so initially i have to git clone right?
[00:25] <yofel> no, you don't need git at all
[00:26] <yofel> we package tarballs if available, not git snapshots. (even if for kolab the tarball is a snapshot of the git tag)
[00:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so now i have to download this libkolab-0.4.1.tar.gz  ?
[00:26] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: uscan does that for you
[00:26] <yofel> using the watch file in the package
[00:27] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: but first things first: start with 'pull-lp-source libkolab raring'
[00:27] <yofel> go into the source and run uscan there
[00:27] <allee> yofel,phoenix_firebrd: here's the mailing list aktivity of the debian kolag pkging: http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-kolab-devel/
[00:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-dev-tools
[00:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: installing
[00:28] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: yep, you'll need those frequently
[00:29] <phoenix_firebrd> allee: i will join the mailing list
[00:29] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: add https://code.launchpad.net/~bulldog98/+archive/kubuntu-dev-tools to the mix, you won't need them immediatly, but they'll be handy 
[00:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: mix?
[00:30] <yofel> just add the ppa to your sources
[00:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: oh :D
[00:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: source pulled
[00:33] <yofel> go into the unpacked source and run uscan
[00:33] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ran uscan
[00:33] <allee> kolab debian pkg summary: http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/pkg-kolab
[00:33] <yofel> good, now run uupdate on the tarball
[00:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have 2 new items one an new version traball and  a sym link
[00:36] <yofel> use the tar with orig in its name
[00:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: http://imagebin.org/243876
[00:39] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: yeah, now run uupdate
[00:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: "uupdate libkolab_0.2.1.orig.tar.gz"
[00:41] <yofel> no, not 0.2.1, 0.4.1
[00:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: "uupdate: cannot find debian/changelog.Are you in the top directory of the source tree?
[00:41] <phoenix_firebrd> "
[00:41] <yofel> you need to be inside libkolab-0.2.1
[00:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[00:41] <yofel> there run
[00:41] <yofel> uupdate ../libkolab_0.4.1.orig.tar.gz
[00:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: done
[00:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have the new source
[00:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the rest is the packaging procedure
[00:44] <yofel> yeah, now it's the standard way of building and fixing
[00:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: For maintainer's name and email , should i put your's?
[00:45] <yofel> no, those are supposed to be set to what it's set now
[00:45] <yofel> for now just try to build the package
[00:45] <yofel> i.e. debuild -S and throw it into pbuilder
[00:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[00:46] <yofel> from a quick build here: a few tests fail, a few new files, and new symbols 
[00:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[00:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: Are you waiting for me?
[00:49] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: not really, where are you at?
[00:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: creating gpg key
[00:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: gpg: skipped "Prasad Murthy <phoenix@matrix>": secret key not available
[00:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the email is wrong
[00:51] <yofel> is $DEBEMAIL set?
[00:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no
[00:52] <yofel> best put that in your .bashrc:
[00:52] <yofel> export DEBFULLNAME='Philip Mu≈°kovac'
[00:52] <yofel> export DEBEMAIL='yofel@kubuntu.org'
[00:52] <yofel> with your data
[00:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: if i put that there wont be a problem in using key
[00:54] <yofel> dch will use that to fill in the name in the changelog, which debsign then uses to search for the ky
[00:54] <yofel> *key
[00:55] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[00:57] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so after setting that i have to download the source again?
[00:58] <yofel> ok, I need to be off to bed, a few hints:
[00:58] <yofel> if you don't have a pbuilder chroot yet, look at pbuilder-dist which should be easy to understand
[00:58] <yofel> if you can't fix the tests (I'm too tried to make sense of the errors right now) disabel them by putting 'override_dh_auto_test:' a the end of debian/rules
[00:58] <yofel> if you don't know what a symbol diff (which you'll see after fixing the install file), look at http://pkg-kde.alioth.debian.org/symbolfiles.html (and no, you don't need to immediately understand that)
[00:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: no, just fix your name in debian/changelog
[00:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok good night, see you later
[00:59] <yofel> feel free to throw questions at the channel anyway, someone might answer while you stick around
[01:00] <yofel> good night
[02:25] <EagleScreen> why apturl-kde depends on software-properties-kde? does it really need it?
[03:10] <claydoh> SteveRiley_: ping ping ping!
[06:39] <shadeslayer> wow
[06:39] <shadeslayer> php closely resembles C++
[06:40] <Tm_T> shadeslayer: pardon?
[06:40] <shadeslayer> Tm_T: my ISP uses a web based login page, and I found this : https://github.com/vercingetorix/Reliance-Broadband/blob/master/index.php
[06:40] <shadeslayer> which is a php script to login from the command line
[06:40] <shadeslayer> looks alot like C++
[06:41] <shadeslayer> it's very OOP oriented 
[06:42] <tsimpson> it's more like C with classes
[06:42] <shadeslayer> heh :)
[10:16] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[10:17] <shadeslayer> hi BluesKaj
[10:17] <BluesKaj> hi shadeslayer
[10:27] <jdrab> hi guys, it looks like this bug is present in kubuntu 13.04 https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-28843 should i report it? or will it be resolved automatically ?
[10:33] <shadeslayer> jdrab: it'll be fixed when Qt releases the next bug fix revision and we package it
[10:34] <jdrab> shadeslayer: ty
[10:34] <shadeslayer> I think  it's in
[10:34] <shadeslayer> ( in the next bug fix release )
[10:34] <jdrab> do you think it will be fixed in neon sooner than 13.04?
[10:35] <shadeslayer> yes
[10:35] <shadeslayer> yofel_: care to upload a new snapshot of Qt ^ ?
[10:35] <shadeslayer> jdrab: this is assuming the fix was committed to Qt itself
[10:36] <shadeslayer> like I said, I *think* it was committed but I don't see a commit url to confirm on jira
[10:36] <shadeslayer> https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,42266
[10:38] <jdrab> i always wanted to try neon :P now it's the time
[10:38] <yofel_> shadeslayer: qtjob is still running, so it should be in when it's committed
[10:38] <shadeslayer> ah you have a cron job running?
[10:38] <shadeslayer> awesome
[10:38] <yofel_> cronjob? what for?
[10:39] <yofel_> https://code.launchpad.net/~neon/+recipe/project-neon-qt
[10:41] <shadeslayer> err
[10:42] <shadeslayer> nvm
[10:42] <shadeslayer> I thought qt had issues being imported
[10:42] <yofel_> those were fixed ages ago ^^
[10:42] <shadeslayer> I see
[10:43] <shadeslayer> I thought we still had cronjob running and what not
[10:43] <shadeslayer> yofel_: btw http://www.golem.de/news/linux-distribution-ubuntu-erwaegt-umstieg-auf-rolling-releases-1301-97086.html
[10:43] <shadeslayer> yofel_: have you heard of this?
[10:43] <yofel_> hum, not yet
[10:44] <yofel_> I wouldn't really be against it. You would essentially have a 2-year stable platform and a bit more flexibility in between that
[10:44] <shadeslayer> yeah
[10:44] <yofel_> although that's what debian is
[10:44] <shadeslayer> heh
[10:45] <shadeslayer> I'd use sid if only their KDE version wasn't so outdated
[10:45] <shadeslayer> and I don't want to roll my own
[10:46] <yofel_> well, I prefer ubuntu as it's generally more up-to-date
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[10:47] <yofel> I'm just worrying how "release packages when they're done" would work
[10:47] <yofel> we would essentially have <release> as rolling and <release-proposed> as dev?
[10:47] <yofel> not that we're not already going in that direction
[10:47] <shadeslayer> I'm not sure how the convinced sabdfl because iirc he was against rolling releases
[10:47] <yofel> ack
[10:48] <xnox> ;-))))))))
[10:48] <yofel> well, he'll keep the LTS releases, and it simplyfies support in general
[10:48] <yofel> as you would essentially drop needs for SRU's the 3 in-between releases
[10:49] <shadeslayer> xnox: oh oh I was installing Netrunner and wanted to ask you something
[10:49] <shadeslayer> xnox: so in the timzone selector I have to select Kolkata
[10:49] <xnox> yofel: security updates as well.
[10:49] <yofel> right
[10:49] <shadeslayer> xnox: which is like this tiny point on the map
[10:49] <shadeslayer> and defines the timezone for the whole of India
[10:50] <shadeslayer> would it be possible to just click India and make it automatically select 'Kolkata'
[10:50]  * yofel notes that this would make our job easier too - as we wouldn't have to worry about providing updates and backports for X releases in parallel but only 2 mostly
[10:50]  * xnox vaguely remembers some bugs about Kolkata as it's not the first time I'm looking it's location up =/
[10:50] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[10:51] <shadeslayer> xnox: so, plz2fix? :D
[10:51] <shadeslayer> I've done about 3-4 installs for friends over the last month and all of them complained about this
[10:52] <shadeslayer> ( I just watched as they did the install so I could see what issues they usually hit )
[10:58] <yofel> shouldn't the time-zone usually be auto recognised?
[10:59] <shadeslayer> yes, but for some reason it failed on 12.10 when I was installing it
[10:59] <shadeslayer> didn't debug why
[11:00] <yofel> hm
[11:00] <yofel> anyway
[11:00] <yofel> -> lunch, bbl

[12:35] <yofel> can someone else please try to reproduce bug 1103135? I can't
[12:35] <ubottu> bug 1103135 in Kubuntu PPA "kate crashes on startup since rc3 upgrade" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1103135
[12:35] <yofel> this is precise
[12:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i can test, rc3 for which version?
[12:42] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: precise + 4.9.98 from beta ppa
[12:42] <yofel> I just asked the reporter if he really did restart his session after the upgrade
[12:42] <yofel> as that symbol error looks fishy
[12:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: Its working in 12.10
[12:43] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: how far did you get with kolab yesterday?
[12:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i dont have 12.04
[12:43] <yofel> no problem
[12:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its in launchpad 4 min to build for i386
[12:44] <yofel> I tried to reproduce it in a VM, but either it's not broken or I'm missing something
[12:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: build successful with pbuilder, some tests fail
[12:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: for the kate thing, there was some problem with qt that make many qt apps crah
[12:45] <phoenix_firebrd> *crash
[12:46] <yofel> hm, that doesn't look like a qt error though
[12:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in pbuilder kdeinit needs klauncher, so do i have to install the minimum kde packages?
[12:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats for testing
[12:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: for testing what?
[12:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the tests fail because kdeinit cant find klauncher binary
[12:50] <yofel> oh, good catch
[12:51] <yofel> I guess adding a build-dep for kdelibs5-plugins for the tests is acceptable
[12:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so after the tests should i have to remove the build-dep?
[12:53] <yofel> no, just add it to the Build-Depends in the control file

[12:55] <yofel> thanks
[12:56] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: what's libkcalccore4 ?
[12:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its in universe , it is needed
[12:56] <yofel> no, wait, we need to clear something up here
[12:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: how can i add universe to the ppa?
[12:57] <yofel> that you can do from the main ppa page -> Edit Dependencies
[12:57] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: now back to the lib: it's needed by what?
[12:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: and it's libkcalcore4 not libkcalccore4
[12:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: during build it failed at a point and i went it to the source and found it needs this
[12:59] <yofel> let me try this again
[12:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: checking
[13:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: yes its a typo
[13:00] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: and another thing: when you upload a package to a ppa, at least append ~ppa1 to the version, as you now won't be able to properly put an updated package into the PPA that can later be  updated to the archive package
[13:01] <yofel> note that ~ lowers the version
[13:01] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, i usually put -
[13:01] <yofel> - is higher, so that won't help either
[13:02]  * yofel tries to build without libkcalcore4 and libkabc
[13:02] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[13:04] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version on how the package version is calculated
[13:05] <phoenix_firebrd> this is heaven
[13:10] <yofel> builds without those libs, but tests still fail
[13:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: for raring right?
[13:11]  * yofel wonders if this is the problem:
[13:11] <yofel> (13:10:19) commonconversion.cpp(43):    ktimezoned is not available and required for timezone interpretation
[13:11] <yofel> raring, yes
[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ktimezoned fails because of dbus not available
[13:12] <yofel> oh, right, now I saw that error too
[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: need dbus and dbus-x11
[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what error?
[13:12] <yofel> already installed
[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in that case kdelibs-plugin?
[13:13] <yofel> klauncher(21427) kdemain: No DBUS session-bus found. Check if you have started the DBUS server. 
[13:13] <phoenix_firebrd> thats it
[13:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: does pbuilder store every build log and if so where?
[13:14] <yofel> did you use pbuilder-dist? I think that stores a .build file somewhere near the source or the build result
[13:14] <yofel> only the last build though
[13:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i used pbuilder
[13:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am confused
[13:18] <yofel> not sure where that puts it, I have this in my .pbuilderrc:
[13:18] <yofel> PKGNAME_LOGFILE_EXTENTION="_$(dpkg --print-architecture).build"
[13:18] <yofel> PKGNAME_LOGFILE=yes
[13:18] <yofel> which puts a logfile in the result folder
[13:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can using pbuilder-dist be different from pbuilder in building process? I am wondering how it failed for me
[13:21] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: do you have universe enabled in pbuilder?
[13:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, i put that in the pbuilderrc file
[13:21] <yofel> hum, can't say it then without a buildlog
[13:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what is the universe repository string
[13:23] <yofel> my sources list has:
[13:23] <yofel> deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring main restricted universe multiverse
[13:27] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no the string which i should be adding in the launchpad
[13:27] <yofel> why launchpad?
[13:27] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: testing
[13:28] <yofel> we're not at a point where the package will even build
[13:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no i wont build
[13:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: just to know
[13:28] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: mathieu-tl AT ubuntu ?
[13:28] <yofel> the ppa already has universe enabled
[13:29] <yofel> you see that in the buildlog
[13:29] <yofel> Get:11 http://ftpmaster.internal raring/universe i386 Packages [5407 kB]
[13:29] <shadeslayer> apparently yes
[13:29] <yofel> shadeslayer: do you know how to use dbus in package tests?
[13:30] <shadeslayer> yofel: I need more info, the kind that KDE ships with ?
[13:30] <shadeslayer> the ones you can start with make check/test
[13:30] <shadeslayer> or autopkg tests and what not
[13:30] <yofel> the ones that dh_auto_test will run
[13:31] <shadeslayer> right, make test/check
[13:31] <yofel> right
[13:32] <shadeslayer> ideally those tests should use dbus-launch?
[13:32] <shadeslayer> or you could override dh_auto_test and manually start a session if the test doesn't do it already?
[13:34] <yofel> that's what I tried, let me try again to get a clean log
[13:39] <yofel> shadeslayer: http://paste.kde.org/654422/
[13:40] <shadeslayer> and are you sure that dbus was launched?
[13:40] <shadeslayer> maybe dbus needs other stuff setup first or sth
[13:40] <yofel> well, I probably did it the wrong way
[13:40] <yofel> now I did 'dbus-launch dh_auto_test' and it hung up
[13:40] <shadeslayer> heh
[13:41] <yofel> oh fun

[13:41] <yofel> this won't work...

[13:42] <shadeslayer> or kded even

[13:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ^
[13:43] <yofel> shadeslayer: how does one do that?
[13:43] <shadeslayer> doesn't matter, just pull it in?
[13:44] <yofel> kde-runtime-data: /usr/share/kde4/services/kded/ktimezoned.desktop
[13:44] <yofel> is installed
[13:46] <shadeslayer> just run kded4
[13:47] <shadeslayer> but dbus should be running I think
[13:47] <shadeslayer> never tried running kded4 without dbus :P
[13:50] <yofel> shadeslayer: running dbus-launch is fine, but I fail at getting DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS and DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID into the environment after that
[13:51] <shadeslayer> oh, how do you do dbus-launch? just dbus-launch?
[13:51] <shadeslayer> can you try eval `dbus-launch`
[13:51] <yofel>         eval `dbus-launch`
[13:51] <yofel>         export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID
[13:51] <yofel>         kded4
[13:51] <yofel>         dh_auto_test
[13:52] <yofel> fails at kded4
[13:53] <shadeslayer> can you do a echo $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS ?
[13:57] <yofel> shadeslayer: hm, DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID is unset
[13:58] <yofel> shadeslayer: http://paste.kde.org/654446
[13:58] <shadeslayer> whaaaa
[13:59] <shadeslayer> hmm how odd
[14:01] <shadeslayer> yofel: try kdeini4 kded4
[14:01] <yofel> great, putting the stuff into a subscript worked... but now:
[14:01] <yofel> kded4: cannot connect to X server :0
[14:01]  * yofel resigns
[14:01] <shadeslayer> xD
[14:01] <shadeslayer> xvfb :P
[14:02] <yofel> why do people assume that kde is running during a build...
[14:03] <agateau> hey, dummy question: are kde packages built with -DQT_NO_DEBUG ?
[14:05] <yofel> agateau: I think yes
[14:06] <agateau> yofel: ok, thanks. Do you know if other distros do the same?
[14:09] <yofel> That I fear I don't know
[14:09] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: sent
[14:10] <yofel> shadeslayer: that hangs even earlier, I think we'll skip this for now
[14:10] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: still there?
[14:10] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya
[14:10] <shadeslayer> yofel: give it to me :P
[14:10] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: watching
[14:10]  * shadeslayer can work on it a bit
[14:10] <yofel> shadeslayer: how about you fix this up once I'm done explaining the rest to phoenix_firebrd?
[14:10] <shadeslayer> ah sure
[14:10] <shadeslayer> whatcha guys packaging?
[14:11] <yofel> libkolab
[14:12] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: put this in your debian/rules: http://paste.kde.org/654464/ - that will make the test not hold everything up
[14:12] <shadeslayer> I see
[14:12]  * shadeslayer would have gone for a .PHONY target there
[14:13] <yofel> why?
[14:14] <shadeslayer> just to be safer?
[14:14] <shadeslayer> though that's fine as well :)
[14:14] <yofel> well, I just wanted to get the error out of the way, not the tests themselves
[14:14] <shadeslayer> ah
[14:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: next?
[14:16] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: try to build it again, it'll end at missing files this time
[14:16]  * shadeslayer notes that we should put up a wiki page explaining what can be shipped and what's blacklisted
[14:17] <yofel> blacklisted as in?
[14:17] <shadeslayer> well
[14:17] <shadeslayer> blacklisted from the seeds
[14:17] <shadeslayer> libav for eg
[14:17] <yofel> ah, look at the seeds?
[14:17] <shadeslayer> sure, but no user looks at the seeds 
[14:17] <yofel> hum, true
[14:18] <shadeslayer> they're like "The thing thats used to grow plants?"
[14:18] <EagleScreen> why apturl-kde depends on software-properties-kde, doues it really need it? is to enable repositories on the fly?
[14:18] <shadeslayer> hmm 
[14:19] <shadeslayer> probably uses some python function?
[14:21] <yofel> doEnableSection() runs software-properties-kde so that's ok
[14:21] <yofel> EagleScreen: that's the case it seems
[14:21] <EagleScreen> I see, thanks
[14:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: you and shadeslayer were discussing about running processes before in testing process, how to do that?
[14:24] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: things like dbus-launch and kded4?
[14:24] <EagleScreen> and that kind of functions shouldn't be go to software-properties-common?
[14:24] <shadeslayer> just add them to the required target
[14:24] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya
[14:24] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: for example dolphin
[14:24] <Riddell> shadeslayer: ship: * !libavcodec*
[14:24] <Riddell> ship: * !phonon-backend-null
[14:25] <Riddell> ! means blacklist
[14:25] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about means blacklist
[14:25] <shadeslayer> Riddell: that too
[14:25] <yofel> EagleScreen: not as long as it does this: http://paste.kde.org/654482
[14:27] <EagleScreen> wow
[14:29] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: rules is a Makefile, there you can define a target which you can then add a list of command to. So in dh7 packaging we would add an override target and just run the commands we want to add before the overridden command
[14:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok. installing fails. http://paste.kde.org/654488/
[14:31] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: right, as those are header files, you'll have to add them to libkolab-dev.install
[14:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what is this file  libkolab-dev.install ?
[14:32] <shadeslayer> afiestas: does webaccounts have a release?
[14:32] <yofel> a .install files tells debhelper what files will end up in a package
[14:32] <afiestas> shadeslayer: ?
[14:32] <shadeslayer> afiestas: a versioned release
[14:32] <yofel> development .so links and header files go into a -dev package by convention
[14:33] <afiestas> don't think so
[14:33] <shadeslayer> like 0.1 or sth
[14:33] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so libkolab-dev.install is the list of files that will be put into libkolab-dev
[14:33] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what about be the location of the  libkolab-dev.install?
[14:33] <yofel> inside the debian/ folder as always
[14:33] <yofel> it's already there, you just need to add the 3 files to it
[14:34] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so the output of debuild would be two packages?
[14:34] <yofel> yes, debian/control has 2 Package: definitions, i.e. you'll get 2 packages
[14:35] <yofel> you can add an install file for every package. (Actually once you have more than one package you need install files)
[14:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok i have added the 3 lines to the install files,should i build ?
[14:36] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: yep, but for the next step make sure that pbuilder saves the buildlog somewhere
[14:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sorry i started the build process without routing to a file, i will do it the next time
[14:39] <yofel> just let pbuilder do that for you...
[14:40] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: do you have any .build files in /var/cache/pbuilder/result/ ?
[14:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: on call
[14:40] <yofel> or wherever the build result gets put for you
[14:42] <Riddell> my toolbars keep disappearing :(
[14:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: that location doesn't contain any logs
[14:44] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: add this to your .pbuilderrc if you don't have it:
[14:44] <yofel> PKGNAME_LOGFILE_EXTENTION="_$(dpkg --print-architecture).build"
[14:44] <yofel> PKGNAME_LOGFILE=yes
[14:45] <yofel> it'll then put a logfile named after the package into $BUILDRESULT
[14:45] <EagleScreen> software-properties-kde seems to be outdated respect software-properties-gtk, do you plan update it ? do you plan use jockey forever to enable restricted drivers? 
[14:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this is my pbuilderrc http://paste.kde.org/654506/
[14:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: is content in rc file correct?
[14:47] <yofel> yes, just add the 2 lines I posted
[14:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: adding
[14:47] <phoenix_firebrd> done
[14:48] <shadeslayer> EagleScreen: re jockey, I might look into that next month
[14:48] <shadeslayer> since no one has bothered looking into it
[14:49] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: while we're at it, let's add one more thing that all of us use
[14:49] <yofel> first run 'bzr co lp:~kubuntu-packagers/pbuilder/pbuilder-hooks ~/.pbuilder-hooks'
[14:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i think build succeed. http://paste.kde.org/654518/ 
[14:50] <yofel> and then add this to your pbuilderrc:
[14:50] <yofel> HOOKDIR="$HOME/.pbuilder-hooks"
[14:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: yep, and now we get to something that's specific to library packaging: symbol files
[14:51] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: do you know what library symbols are?
[14:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i was once , when cracking windows exes and dlls
[14:52] <yofel> ah ok, linux ofc has them too, and we track the ABI of a library by keeping a list of all provided symbols in the package
[14:53] <yofel> that's what the libkolab0.symbols file in the package is for
[14:53] <yofel> now you'll see that dpkg-gensymbols posted a diff in the buildlog
[14:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: checking
[14:53] <yofel> so the new version adds a lot of symbols (and removes 2 optional ones - marked as #MISSING#)
[14:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i can see that in the log
[14:55] <yofel> good, as c++ is a bit weird with symbols, we have a helper called pkgkde-symbolshelper that helps to manage the symbols
[14:55] <yofel> you can read more on that on http://pkg-kde.alioth.debian.org/symbolfiles.html
[14:55] <yofel> for now I'll explain on how to update the file
[14:56] <yofel> for that you'll need to be inside the package, i.e. in libkolab-0.4.1
[14:56] <yofel> next you'll need a file with the symbol diff, the buildlog works fine for that
[14:56] <yofel> now you need to update the symbols for the new version, which you can do with:
[14:57] <yofel> pkgkde-symbolshelper batchpatch -v 0.4.1 path_to_buildlog
[14:57] <yofel> just put the actual buildlog a the end instead
[14:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: this should look like this in the end: http://paste.kde.org/654524
[14:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the buildlog should be full or partial is satisfied?
[14:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: partial is fine as long as you have the complete symbol diff
[14:59] <yofel> as the script will look for the output of dpkg-gensymbols
[14:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: shall i try with this http://paste.kde.org/654518/?
[14:59] <yofel> yeah, should work
[15:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/654530/
[15:03] <yofel> yeah, looks right
[15:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what about the missing ones
[15:04] <yofel> now just to clean it up: open the symbols file in an editor, look for the MISSING ones and remove the commented lines
[15:04] <yofel> they're optional so don't worry about them
[15:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this is the symbol file after removing the commented lines http://paste.kde.org/654536/
[15:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok?
[15:08] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have done the launchpad pbuilder hook
[15:08] <yofel> the symbolsfile looks ok from what I see. Try building again, this time there should be no diff
[15:09] <yofel> good, those are some pbuilder enhancements that we use to make life easier
[15:09] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what does that do?
[15:10] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: it's just a set of scripts, feel free to read them. The pbuilder manpage explains when what is called
[15:10] <yofel> (most important ones are auto-installing-updates and running list-missing at the end)
[15:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[15:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: going to build again
[15:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what about the tests? is it mandate for them to succeed to build a package?
[15:14] <yofel> it's mostly a mandate in main, so I think we could live without them. But they should work really. Problem now is that it seems you need to set up a working kde session during the build for them to work :/
[15:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i installed dbus and dbus-x11 after login and with save after login option
[15:15] <yofel> that won't help for the archive
[15:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya
[15:16] <yofel> there you have to set everything up during the build
[15:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: why didn't apt-cache search klaunch return kdelibs5-plugin , instead return some xfce package?
[15:17] <phoenix_firebrd> *klauncher
[15:17] <yofel> klauncher has no own package, use dpkg -S or apt-file search
[15:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: right
[15:21] <yofel> geh, running make test on a local libkolab build opens kompare several times
[15:21] <yofel> that's not doable during a package build
[15:21] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd, shadeslayer: forget the tests -.-
[15:21] <shadeslayer> oh?
[15:22] <shadeslayer> why not?
[15:22] <phoenix_firebrd> ?
[15:22] <yofel> see 2 lines above
[15:22] <shadeslayer> xvfb?
[15:22] <yofel> and how do you close kompare in xvfb?
[15:22] <shadeslayer> or whatever it's called
[15:22] <shadeslayer> don't?
[15:22] <yofel> the tests don't continue while it's open?
[15:22] <shadeslayer> ah
[15:22]  * shadeslayer thinks
[15:23] <shadeslayer> yofel: if possible, can you check if there's a dbus interface that we can call as soon as kompare is seen on the screen?
[15:23] <shadeslayer> so you could tell it to quit
[15:23] <shadeslayer> over dbus
[15:23] <phoenix_firebrd> why is it opening
[15:25] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: because it's a test :)
[15:25] <shadeslayer> yofel: and complaint loudly to kolab people :P
[15:25] <yofel> qdbus org.kde.kompare-24620 /kompare/FirstKompareShell org.qtproject.Qt.QWidget.close
[15:25] <yofel> works, but as you see it has the PID in the interface URL
[15:25] <shadeslayer> simple
[15:26] <shadeslayer> qdbus `qdbus|grep kompare 0 /kompare/FirstKompareShell org.qtproject.Qt.QWidget.close` 
[15:26] <shadeslayer> erm
[15:26] <yofel> ok, I'll leave it to you to figure it out :P
[15:26] <shadeslayer> qdbus `qdbus|grep kompare` /kompare/FirstKompareShell org.qtproject.Qt.QWidget.close` 
[15:26] <shadeslayer> haha :P
[15:26] <shadeslayer> just give me the packaging :P
[15:26] <shadeslayer> when you're done
[15:26] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: how did the build go?
[15:26] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: fun, upstream will refuse qapt/packagekit patches
[15:27] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its running
[15:27] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I just talked to Lamarque and he said that he will not allow packages that add a feature that installs VPN packages on the fly when clicking "Setup VPN" or sth
[15:28] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: they won't, it can just be a compile-time switch, and show a proper error message when there is no way to invoke qapt or whatever, this is implementation detail that shouldn't be considered too much
[15:28] <cyphermox> instead, I'd just write a patch and propose it
[15:28] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: I mentioned that
[15:28] <shadeslayer> see the latest switch, you can try and convince him if you want :P
[15:28] <shadeslayer> erm
[15:28] <shadeslayer> s/switch/email/
[15:28] <kubotu> shadeslayer: You did something wrong... Try s/you/me/ or tell me "help sed"
[15:28] <Riddell> shadeslayer: why not?
[15:28] <shadeslayer> Riddell: "You can patch Plasma NM when building packages for (K)Ubuntu. I am just saying that I will not patch Plasma NN to do half work, if it does not work for everybody then this change should stay in (K)Ubuntu only."
[15:29] <shadeslayer> from email archives
[15:29] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: and by upstream I meant KDE upstream
[15:29] <Riddell> ok so we can add the feature but he won't take it upstream
[15:29] <shadeslayer> yes
[15:30] <Riddell> shadeslayer: remind me again why we need this?
[15:30] <shadeslayer> Riddell: plasma-widget-nm statically compiles a list of VPN stuff in the UI
[15:30] <shadeslayer> and that stuff won't actually work until that nm plugin is installed
[15:31] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: I think the approach by email was wrong, I'll respond
[15:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: full log http://paste.kde.org/654566/
[15:31] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: I see
[15:31] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: feel free to
[15:32] <shadeslayer> Riddell: go to the VPN tab in network manager plasmoid
[15:33] <shadeslayer> so if you add PPTP for eg, it won't work till you have network-manager-pptp install
[15:33] <shadeslayer> *installed
[15:33] <Riddell> shadeslayer: but why can't we just have them all installed by default?
[15:33] <shadeslayer> useless for most users?
[15:35] <Riddell> hmm   blacklist:network-manager-vpnc
[15:35] <Riddell> I wonder why that is
[15:35] <Riddell> I'm not sure that seed actually does anything now
[15:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I am getting an error "pkgkde-symbolshelper: error: no valid patches found"
[15:39] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: there is no patch - which means everything's ok now
[15:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thought so, nice
[15:40] <yofel> I just noticed that cmake complains about SWIG, but I have that installed here and it still complains
[15:40] <Riddell> yofel: has libkolab changed a lot?
[15:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: where did you see, in my log?
[15:40] <yofel> Riddell: a few new headers, new symbols, and a few new annoying tests
[15:41] <yofel> the tests are what we're talking about all day
[15:41] <yofel> oh, I had swig2.0, kolab wants swig
[15:41]  * yofel has no idea what swig is
[15:41] <yofel> Description-en: Generate scripting interfaces to C/C++ code
[15:44] <shadeslayer> wtf
[15:44] <shadeslayer> I can't resize a skype window
[15:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: should we add swig2.0 to build-deps ?
[15:45] <shadeslayer> the chat window specifically
[15:46] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: it's 'swig' that it wants - but I don't see any difference when adding it...
[15:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: loss of functionality witout that?
[15:47] <yofel> not sure, I guess it won't hurt to add it
[15:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[15:47] <yofel> So add it and put the package somewhere where shadeslayer can fetch it
[15:48] <yofel> as I think we're done otherwise
[15:48] <shadeslayer> put it in a PPA?
[15:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  ok :)
[15:48] <yofel> ok, ppa...
[15:48] <phoenix_firebrd> mine?
[15:49] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: if you want to put it in the same ppa again, 2 things:
[15:49] <yofel> a) manually delete the package in there first
[15:49] <phoenix_firebrd> ~ppa1?
[15:49] <yofel> b) change the version to 0.4.1-0ubuntu1~ubuntu13.04~ppa1
[15:49] <yofel> that's the convention for raring
[15:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[15:50] <Riddell> apachelogger: bug 1102165 known to you?
[15:50] <ubottu> bug 1102165 in amarok (Ubuntu) "Playlist loops if the last file is an Ogg Vorbis" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1102165
[15:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: and update the changelog a bit
[15:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so it tells others what you did
[15:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: meaning at least updating the install and symbol files
[15:51] <yofel> :q
[15:51] <yofel> fail -.-
[15:53] <shadeslayer> :P
[15:53] <shadeslayer> Who want's to reply to "Change the default settings of Kubuntu to improve the first time user experience "
[15:53] <yofel> read it half, ask me again on saturday
[15:54] <shadeslayer> haha
[15:54] <EagleScreen> shadeslayer: and what will you reply to him?
[15:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i can't understand what you are asking me to put in the changelog
[15:54]  * Riddell is doing e-mails now
[15:54] <shadeslayer> awesome
[15:55] <shadeslayer> EagleScreen: just that some stuff can't be done while other stuff should be done in upstream KDE
[15:55] <shadeslayer> Kubuntu aims to provide a pristine KDE experience.
[15:55] <yofel> Riddell++
[15:55] <shadeslayer> now if that experience is bad, fix it in KDE
[15:56] <EagleScreen> who decided that Kubuntu has to provide a pristine KDE experience?
[15:56] <shadeslayer> Riddell :P
[15:56] <EagleScreen> I think the guy who wrote that message has a lot of reason
[15:56] <shadeslayer> and I think almost everyone agrees
[15:57] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: something like http://paste.kde.org/654620 - just so people know that you did change something
[15:57] <EagleScreen> a few custimation over the default KDE would improve the first user experiencie
[15:57] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: really?
[15:58] <shadeslayer> EagleScreen: any reason why they should not be upstreamed?
[15:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: when the user sees this what will they understand ?
[15:58] <shadeslayer> i.e. made default in KDE
[15:58] <yofel> a few things like yakuake are nonsense, vlc isn't doable I think. We already talked about rekonq. Do people use the keep above others button? I do, but do others?
[15:58] <shadeslayer> EagleScreen: note that we're talking about KDE configs in particular
[15:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: that's not for users, but for fellow package maintainers
[15:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: and people that review what you did
[15:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: oh
[15:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: now it makes sense
[15:59] <yofel> it's the same as a VCS commit message really
[15:59] <EagleScreen> shadeslayer: yes, it is much harder and it will take much time to have it done by upstream than by Kubuntu, many distributions customize its desktops to improve the user experience, upstream hasn't the reason always
[16:00] <shadeslayer> not harder
[16:00] <shadeslayer> if it's sane and everyone agrees that it's a sane default, it won't be harder
[16:00]  * yofel wonders if his reply to kde bug 310486 was a bit too harsh
[16:00] <ubottu> KDE bug 310486 in general "Unable to logout/reboot after KDE upgrade." [Major,Confirmed] http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=310486
[16:01] <yofel> not even sure that's something *they* want to even be concerned about
[16:03] <EagleScreen> i have suffered off that bug
[16:03] <Riddell> yofel: grumpy! :)
[16:03] <EagleScreen> i'd only worry about it if it happens also in minor kde upgrades (4.9.4 -> 4.9.5)
[16:03] <Riddell> yofel: but that is a longstanding problem
[16:04] <yofel> Riddell: yeah, but usually it works - just this time they change the implementation and BOOM
[16:05] <yofel> EagleScreen: yeah, it's not really *that* great of an issue. But it looks REALLY unprofessional if a software update causes you do hard-cycle your system
[16:05] <yofel> which is what my dad would do in such a situation
[16:06] <EagleScreen> my dad and all my friend would do it too
[16:07] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: this is my ppa "murthy/test"
[16:07] <shadeslayer> cool
[16:07] <shadeslayer> oh
[16:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have uploaded the package waiting for the confirmation mail
[16:08] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: you're from India? :D
[16:08]  * shadeslayer is guessing from the name
[16:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya
[16:08] <shadeslayer> your package is FTBFS in the PPA xD
[16:08] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: I'm in Gurgaon :)
[16:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i am from Tamilnadu
[16:08]  * shadeslayer rages at bzr for being so slow to checkout
[16:09] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: nice
[16:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: you are a software engineer?
[16:10] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: yeah :)
[16:10] <shadeslayer> by profession only however
[16:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: cool
[16:11] <shadeslayer> I'm electronics and comm. engineer by education :P
[16:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: me too
[16:11] <shadeslayer> :)
[16:12] <Riddell> shadeslayer: really?  so this kubuntu stuff is just a side hobby for you?
[16:12] <shadeslayer> it's the other way around, the Electronics/GSM stuff was a hobby
[16:12] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: if you want, libkolabxml would be the next thing to update - it's less work too (I just checked ;P)
[16:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sure, can i do it tomorrow? 
[16:13] <yofel> 1 patch to be dropped, a few new build-deps, and that's it
[16:13] <yofel> sure, just say if you need help or a review
[16:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sure, its bed time and i have to finish my dinner
[16:14] <yofel> hm, it seems some people can go to bed before sunrise... unlike shadeslayer :P
[16:14] <shadeslayer> hehe
[16:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have uploaded the files and its in the ppa, how can i delete the old one, there is no option to delete it
[16:15] <shadeslayer> I pulled off about 30 hours on Monday-Tuesday
[16:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: usually i do that
[16:15] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: https://launchpad.net/~murthy/+archive/test/+packages should have a delete button on the right side of the page
[16:15] <shadeslayer> at the end of 30 hours I wanted to just sleep
[16:15] <yofel> if you haven't deleted the package yet it'll probably get rejected
[16:16] <shadeslayer> but won't it get rejected even then?
[16:16] <shadeslayer> i.e. even after deleting them
[16:16] <yofel> as long as the tarball isn't different it should accept it I think
[16:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: done
[16:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its getting built for amd64
[16:17] <yofel> ah, the version is totally wrong, but I guess we can fix that
[16:18] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: pro tip, I know how much internet connections in India suck, so I'd advise asking Riddell for an EC2 instance since usually that's alot faster to work on
[16:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: omg, very sorry , i just noticed that
[16:19] <shadeslayer> or buying a dedicated server if you have the moniez
[16:19] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya
[16:20] <Riddell> ec2 available on request indeed
[16:22] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: nevermind, it would only be a problem for someone that uses the ppa
[16:23] <shadeslayer> Riddell: can you upload PA3 today?
[16:23] <shadeslayer> I cannot find the time to upload it :|
[16:23] <shadeslayer> note that the rules could use with a bit of fixing ( needs branch switching )
[16:25] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: what troubles me more is not the internet speed, it the 2 hrs scheduled power cut. 
[16:25] <shadeslayer> haha
[16:25] <Riddell> shadeslayer: it's ready?
[16:25] <shadeslayer> My router + modem combo is on backup power
[16:25] <shadeslayer> Riddell: yes
[16:25] <shadeslayer> I tested it, works perfectly
[16:25] <Riddell> sweet
[16:26] <Riddell> shadeslayer: from ~kubuntu-active PPA?
[16:26] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  here no backup
[16:26] <shadeslayer> yep
[16:26] <shadeslayer> It also changed my configs to be more tablet friendly 
[16:26] <shadeslayer> so when I logged into plasma-desktop, all my buttons were *huge*
[16:27] <shadeslayer> yofel: apachelogger suggest we should setup a PPA with packages that replace standard kde packages but everything be built from git
[16:27] <shadeslayer> want to start on that? :D
[16:28] <Riddell> shadeslayer: mm isn't that neon?
[16:29] <shadeslayer> Riddell: no, neon installs to /opt/project-neon
[16:29] <shadeslayer> We're talking about dailies that replace your stable desktop
[16:29] <Riddell> shadeslayer: the maintinance of that sounds impossible
[16:29] <shadeslayer> for people living on the extreme edge
[16:29] <shadeslayer> Riddell: that's what I said as well
[16:29] <Riddell> there's a reason neon uses simplified packaging
[16:29] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[16:30] <shadeslayer> Riddell: possibly apachelogger was drunk or sth
[16:30] <yofel> well, it's not IMPOSSIBLE with more patterns in install files etc. but it would need some dedicated maintainer (not me)
[16:31] <yofel> and the launchpad folks would probably want to kill us for building kde daily twice
[16:31] <shadeslayer> haha
[16:34] <Alex_Zion> HI guys , i'm pretty sure a lot of user here are on kubuntu devel mailing list, where I post my first post yesterday, it was a well written post !?! , I mean is the first time I write and I never read you mailing list, so I don't know, it was too long, too short, is better put more o less detail or they are just enough !?! and stuff like that , just to teach me even how to write a good and usefull posts on mailing list .. :)
[16:36] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: you will take care of the rest for libkolab ?
[16:37] <Riddell> Alex_Zion: a good e-mail, I'm writing a reply now, most of the issues we've considered before however
[16:37] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: yeah :)
[16:37] <Alex_Zion> well , good to know Riddell ;)
[16:37] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thank you
[16:37] <shadeslayer> I'll try and do enable tests in a bit
[16:37] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: anything else?
[16:38] <BluesKaj> ok , bbl..stuff to do
[16:38] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: for libkolab? not from my side
[16:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in that case good night to you, shadeslayer Riddell. I have learned something today.
[16:39] <shadeslayer> night :)
[16:39] <yofel> gn
[16:39] <Riddell> night phoenix_firebrd 
[17:09] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: there, if we send a patch it will be accepted.
[17:09] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[17:28] <shadeslayer> yofel: odd : kded(14371): KUniqueApplication: Cannot find the D-Bus session server:  "Unable to autolaunch a dbus-daemon without a $DISPLAY for X11" 
[17:28] <shadeslayer> even though X was started
[17:29] <yofel> hm, is DISPLAY set?
[17:30] <shadeslayer> yep
[17:30] <shadeslayer> that's the first thing I do

=== jessie|lunch is now known as jessie|work
[17:51] <apachelogger> shadeslayer, Riddell: gentoo has a smaller team and they manage to do it...
[17:52] <yofel> apachelogger: using how simple packaging? (I didn't look at the portage scripts)
[17:53] <apachelogger> the point is it is no more work than what we do now
[17:53] <apachelogger> except it is incremental
[17:53] <yofel> hm
[17:53] <apachelogger> so half the team does not become unavailable when a kde release is out
[17:53] <yofel> well
[17:54] <yofel> I guess I could wrap something up experimentally for the core packages
[17:54] <shadeslayer> yofel: any ideas how I can get xvfb-run to run multiple commands in one go?
[17:54] <yofel> no
[17:54] <apachelogger> I am not saying we should do this for every package, but at least the core monolithic ones
[17:54] <shadeslayer> :S
[17:54] <apachelogger> i.e. libs,pimlibs,workspace,baseapps,runtime
[17:55] <yofel> then you might as well do it for the others as there's not much to maintain there - except running a script to update the version as needed
[17:55] <apachelogger> or ones where we have an interest in tighlty following development
[17:55] <apachelogger> yofel: in the long run, yes
[17:56] <apachelogger> however since there is so little change in the other sources the gain is also smaller
[17:56] <yofel> well, I get your point about the main packages
[17:56] <shadeslayer> yay my krunner hanged
[17:56] <shadeslayer> managed to get some backtrace : http://paste.kde.org/654812/
[17:57] <yofel> do you want to follow master? As the RC's are branched off and I'm not sure if it makes sense to constantly import all the stable branches
[17:58] <apachelogger> I'd simply follow master
[17:58] <apachelogger> from rc to final there is also no significant change that would benefit from incremental updates 
[17:58] <apachelogger> (or at least there should not be ';))
[18:00] <yofel> apachelogger: how would you handle the branches then? As we'll have to branch our packaging if we do that - or stop using bzr with RC which I don't really want to use
[18:00] <apachelogger> branch
[18:00] <yofel> or we simply start using branches in general for every kde release (which'll be a lot)
[18:00] <apachelogger> we should branch more anyway
[18:00] <apachelogger> yofel: yeah, a lot, but that is entirely bazaars fault :S
[18:01] <yofel> ack
[18:01] <apachelogger> iff launchpad and bazaar supported that workflow better I'd also simply daily build everything we have and branch for each release
[18:02] <apachelogger> but as it stand we'd then have 5k branches after 1 year ^^
[18:02] <yofel> who cares? ^^
[18:04] <apachelogger> makes stuff hard to use for newcomers etc.
[18:04] <yofel> well, most of us already use kbzr to check stuff out, we can just extend that
[18:05] <apachelogger> yeah, of *us*
[18:05] <apachelogger> ^^
[18:05] <yofel> others are supposed to read the Vcs links in the packages...
[18:05] <apachelogger> so we need to change those all the time
[18:05] <apachelogger> also merging between bazaar branches does not give me joy... so much easier with git :P
[18:05] <yofel> script it
[18:05] <yofel> true
[18:08] <yofel> apachelogger: did you have a plan for managing the failure notifications? Other than adding yet another team and using it's ML to handle that
[18:09] <yofel> also remind me to look at the notifications for ~kubuntu-packagers. Even if CIA is dead I would still like to know when people change something...
[18:19] <shadeslayer> there's this alternate site for CIA

[20:22] <shadeslayer> lol
[20:22] <shadeslayer> don't install empathy with ktp
[20:22] <shadeslayer> it's causes mashups
[20:23] <yofel> please fix that on a packaging level...
[20:23] <yofel> well, "fix" it
[20:23] <jussi> yeah, Ive both kde and unity desktops here
[20:23] <jessie|work> I don't have empathy installed.
[20:23] <jussi> yeah, its a bit shit that it happens like that to be honest.
[20:24] <shadeslayer> yofel: it can't be
[20:24] <jessie|work> Nevermind, I was lost in the sauce for a moment there.
[20:24] <shadeslayer> well
[20:24] <yofel> yeah, nvm
[20:24] <shadeslayer> because it's perfectly fine to have both of them installed
[20:24] <shadeslayer> but runtime can cause issues
[20:24] <jessie|work> I was talking about kio-mtp and misread that as ktp or what not.
[20:24] <jussi> shadeslayer: cant you just put a nice "confilcts" in there? 
[20:24] <shadeslayer> jussi: why? it's just the runtime that's problematic
[20:24] <jussi> oh
[20:25] <jussi> well whatever, its evil and removing it made it work :D

[20:40] <shadeslayer> yeah
[20:42] <cyphermox> ScottK: hi
[20:42] <yofel> shadeslayer: anyway, you said that wrapping dh_auto_test in xvfb-run makes the tests build in general, right?
[20:43] <yofel> should we do that in neon?
[20:43] <shadeslayer> yes it does
[20:43] <shadeslayer> maybe?
[20:43] <yofel> I'll give it some tries later
[20:43] <shadeslayer> it'll need kde-runtime and kdelibs-bin installed
[20:43] <shadeslayer> oh and kdelibs plugins 
[20:44] <yofel> ok, kdelibs is a non-issue, kde-runtime we'll have to see
[20:46] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/654968/
[20:46] <shadeslayer> though I'm thinking of making a while loop
[20:46] <shadeslayer> to check the pidof kompare
[20:46] <shadeslayer> that's just a hack I threw together :P
[20:47] <yofel> shadeslayer: that immediately reminded me of http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Too-Much-Sleep.aspx
[20:47] <yofel> though not as bad ^^

[21:00] <vassie> hello everyone, i'm interested in packaging an app that isn't in the repos for kubuntu

[21:01] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1103383 in Ubuntu "[needs-packaging] cantata" [Wishlist,New]
[21:01] <shadeslayer> yofel: any ideas how to make it check for a null pid again and again?
[21:02] <yofel> vassie: that would be Riddell probably :)
[21:02] <vassie> yofel: yes, didn't know if he was online
[21:03] <yofel> shadeslayer: null pid? as in whether pidof returns nothing?
[21:03] <shadeslayer> yep
[21:03] <shadeslayer> as in, keep polling till you get a pid
[21:04] <yofel> uh, assign the output to a variable and check if that's -z?
[21:05] <shadeslayer> sure, but how do I loop over that
[21:06] <yofel> the tricky part would be knowing when to stop...
[21:07] <shadeslayer> when it's not zero? :P
[21:07] <yofel> and how many kompare's do you need to kill?
[21:07] <shadeslayer> just the one
[21:08] <yofel> hm, I got more than one here, but if it's just one..
[21:10] <shadeslayer> oh
[21:11] <shadeslayer> I think I figured it out
[21:11] <Riddell> evening
[21:11] <Riddell> hi vassie, welcome along
[21:11] <yofel> usually it's 
[21:11] <yofel> var=
[21:11] <yofel> while zero
[21:11] <yofel> set it
[21:11] <yofel> done
[21:11] <vassie> Riddell: hello
[21:13] <vassie> Riddell: i've been playing around with cantata and it compiles fine on 12.10, but i'm using checkinstall to build a deb, which i assume isn't very clean?
[21:18] <vassie> Riddell: i'm more than happy to help officially package it, or create my own ppa
[21:19] <shadeslayer> bah
[21:19] <shadeslayer> yofel: the build fails when doing pidof kompare
[21:19] <shadeslayer> because there's no compare
[21:20] <shadeslayer> I'll have to add -
[21:20] <yofel> was just about to ask how you run it, but if that works do it
[21:23] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/655016/
[21:26] <Riddell> vassie: awooga
[21:26] <Riddell> vassie: want me to take you through it now? will probably take about an hour
[21:27] <yofel> shadeslayer: line 15 should use the var, no?
[21:27] <shadeslayer> yes
[21:27] <shadeslayer> :P
[21:27] <yofel> bad shadeslayer testing whether I'm awake :P
[21:27] <shadeslayer> hehe
[21:27] <vassie> Riddell: that would be awesome, but i'm going to have to go offline soon, is it ok if i mail you?
[21:28] <shadeslayer> I think I should sleep now
[21:28] <Riddell> vassie: yeah we can find another time if that works better
[21:28] <shadeslayer> last rebuild
[21:28] <shadeslayer> yofel: I still think the loop is wrong btw
[21:28] <vassie> Riddell: thank you, i appreciate the help
[21:29] <yofel> s/$(komparePid)/$$komparePid/ maybe
[21:29] <kubotu> yofel: You did something wrong... Try s/you/me/ or tell me "help sed"
[21:29] <yofel> be quiet kubotu
[21:36] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/655028/
[21:37] <yofel> shadeslayer: oh, the loop needs to be on one line, so use \
[21:37] <shadeslayer> ahh
[21:37] <yofel> and move the - before the while I guess
[21:37] <shadeslayer> hmm

[21:39] <shadeslayer> kquitapp(26170): "Application kompare-6356 could not be found using service org.kde.kompare-6356 and path /MainApplication." 
[21:39] <yofel> o.O
[22:03] <shadeslayer> yofel: odd
[22:04] <shadeslayer> very odd
[22:04] <shadeslayer> I have : root     11676  1.4  0.3 352040 27032 pts/4    Sl   22:04   0:00 kompare -c /tmp/buildd/libkolab-0.4.1/obj-x86_64-linux-gnu/tests/expectedFile.h11607 /tmp/buildd/libkolab-0.4.1/obj-x86_64-linux-gnu/tests/convertedFile.L11607
[22:05] <shadeslayer> but let's say I do qdbus
[22:05] <yofel> qdbus on the right dbus session?
[22:05] <shadeslayer> dunn
[22:05] <shadeslayer> I get : Could not connect to D-Bus server: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Spawn.ExecFailed: //bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally with the following error: No protocol specified
[22:05] <shadeslayer> Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.
[22:06] <yofel> o.O
[22:11] <shadeslayer> meh, I'm sleeping
[22:11] <shadeslayer> too tired for this
[22:12] <yofel> do so, good job getting so far :)
[22:12] <shadeslayer> yeah, maybe I can figure out the solution in my sleep xD
[22:12] <shadeslayer> though interesting how it worked once
