[01:46] <TheLordOfTime> ohai anyone in the xubuntu devs able to answer a question regarding a bug found in Xubuntu?
[01:46]  * TheLordOfTime works on ubuntu server, and is on bugsquad, but would like some consultation on how a specific xubuntu bug needs processed
[01:46] <pleia2> TheLordOfTime: most of our devs are in europe so sleeping right now, you can probably just ask and they'll get to it when they're awake :)
[01:47] <TheLordOfTime> i see
[01:47] <TheLordOfTime> well, then.
[01:48] <TheLordOfTime> this bug was confirmed in xscreensaver, but was opinion'd in fglrx.  the person managing the bug (agrestringere) is itrying to figure out a specific course of action:
[01:48] <TheLordOfTime> whether to assign xscreensaver and remove fglrx
[01:48] <TheLordOfTime> or wether to leave fglrx
[01:48] <TheLordOfTime> its a bug reported in Xubuntu, so i thought i'd consult with xubuntu-devs to figure out their recommendation 
[01:48] <TheLordOfTime> before blindly following standard ubuntu triage guides.
[01:49] <TheLordOfTime> pretty certain the course of action needed though
[01:49] <TheLordOfTime> just checking ;)
[01:50] <agrestringere> Hello, have an Xubuntu related bug was wondering if Xscreensaver could be the culprit here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/1015297
[01:50] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1015297 in Xubuntu "Screen partially darkened after suspend and resume in Xubuntu" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[01:50] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[01:50] <TheLordOfTime> i'm already here agrestringere :P
[01:51] <TheLordOfTime> agrestringere, i already asked proper triage procedure for this, but since most the devs, according to pleia2, are in europe/asleep, i think we will need to wait on a response
[01:54] <Unit193> TheLordOfTime: But he linked faster. ;)
[01:55] <TheLordOfTime> Unit193, true, because i lagged when i pasted hte bug
[01:55] <TheLordOfTime> it was supposed to be sent but got lost apparently
[03:08] <micahg> agrestringere: it could be XScreensaver exposing a bug in the video drivers
[04:02] <agrestringere> micahg, so you think I should include all relevant graphics packages?
[04:03] <micahg> agrestringere: no, I think you might want to discuss with either the kernel or X teams to try to narrow down the issue
[04:05] <agrestringere> ok

[20:35] <knome> ochosi, at some point, would you please go through https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-r-xubuntu-appearance and create work items?
[20:38] <maddernick> what was it he asked me to do? Was I to make a merge request?
[21:07] <knome> maddernick, mmh, that (though the previous comment didn't relate to that specifically)
