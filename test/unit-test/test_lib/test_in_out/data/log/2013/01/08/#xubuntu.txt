[13:06] <Ronalds_M> what the hell is wrong with xubuntu 12.10, after upgrade from 12.04
[13:06] <Ronalds_M> jockey-gtk is missing
[13:06] <Ronalds_M> when I install it, it doesn't starts
[13:06] <knome> Ronalds_M, mind the language.
[13:07] <Ronalds_M> I did almost clean upgrade
[13:07] <Ronalds_M> drivers are missing
[13:07] <knome> Ronalds_M, starting from 12.10, jockey is found under "software sources"
[13:07] <Ronalds_M> ohh
[13:07] <Ronalds_M> and where is nvidia
[13:07] <Ronalds_M> ?
[13:07] <Ronalds_M> settings?
[13:08] <baizon> Ronalds_M: there isnt no jockey-gtk
[13:08] <knome> baizon, ...as i just said
[13:08] <baizon> sorry knome was to slow reading :)
[13:08] <baizon> Ronalds_M: same place as knome said :)
[13:09] <knome> nvidia-settings should be there when you've installed the drivers
[13:09] <Ronalds_M> no settings for me
[13:09] <Ronalds_M> also nvidia doesn't show in software sources
[13:10] <Ronalds_M> everything seems to be slowed down cause of that
[13:11] <Ronalds_M> nvidia-173-dev:  Depends: nvidia-173 (>= 173.14.35)
[13:11] <Ronalds_M> tried to install driver at synaptic
[13:11] <nantou> if I need 56 minutes to copy 9GB of data from HDD to external HDD that means something is wrong with my 12.10, am I wrong?
[13:12] <Ronalds_M> nvidia-173:  Depends: xorg-video-abi-11  but it is not installable or  	xorg-video-abi-12  but it is not installable
[13:12] <knome> nantou, i'd rather look at your hdd's
[13:12] <nantou> knome, it cannot be the external one, can it? its only an EXT4 to store data
[13:13] <baizon> nantou: check the hard drives
[13:13] <knome> Ronalds_M, have you enabled the restricted repositories?
[13:14] <baizon> nantou: http://askubuntu.com/questions/59064/how-to-run-a-checkdisk
[13:15] <Ronalds_M> yes
[13:16] <Ronalds_M> I'm currently download nvidia current
[13:18] <Ronalds_M> You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.  Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server.
[13:18] <Ronalds_M> right
[13:19] <Ronalds_M> nvidia-173:  Depends: xorg-video-abi-11  but it is not installable or  	xorg-video-abi-12  but it is not installable
[13:19] <Ronalds_M> what the h?
[13:25] <cousteau> The screensaver I installed is displaying debug messages on screen.  Is there a way to turn them off?
[13:25] <cousteau> I think there's an option for that in xscreensaver, -no-capture-stderr
[13:40] <Ronalds_M> so I ended up installing xubuntu from scratch, I certainly doesn't support upgrading from 12.04 if anybody has nvidia drivers
[14:25] <xubuntu610> hi guys anyone one knows how to make dvd autoplay on 12.0
[14:25] <xubuntu610> 12.10
[14:26] <xubuntu610> I have issue with DVD video ... cd audio autoplay but for DVD i need to open parole and click on "play disk"
[14:28] <knome> xubuntu610, menu -> settings manager -> removable drives and media -> tab multimedia
[14:31] <xubuntu610> knome this is the problem, the settings there are ok
[14:32] <knome> xubuntu610, what does the dvd command say?
[14:32] <xubuntu610> parole --device=%d
[14:35] <xubuntu610> also when I insert an audio disk I have 2 icons on the desktop, one "disk 680mb" and one "audio disk"
[14:48] <crond> Is it normal for a core2duo to peg 80c under load for an exteneded period in a laptop?
[14:53] <TheSheep> try asking on ##hardware
[14:56] <crond> ty
[15:17]  * cousteau thinks of "80c" as a hexadecimal temperature
[15:20] <baizon> crond: i think so
[15:21] <cousteau> so this screensaver is displaying error or warning messages on screen.  How can I prevent that?
[15:22] <baizon> cousteau: have you tried -no-capture-stderr
[15:22] <baizon> or resetting the configuration
[15:23] <cousteau> baizon, I Think that's what I need, but where am I supposed to use it?
[15:24] <cousteau> I don't feel like re-running xscreensaver manually each time I reboot; I guess I can set it somewhere
[15:24] <baizon> just use in terminal xscreensaver -no-capture-stderr
[15:28] <cousteau> baizon, I mean, that would involve running that command each time I run xscreensaver, right?
[15:29] <baizon> right
[15:29] <cousteau> or is that option magically set forever?  (kinda like the -c in `metacity -c`)
[15:29] <cousteau> yeah, ok then, is there a way to disable it?
[15:29] <baizon> cousteau: yes, set it in the .Xdefaults
[15:29] <baizon> more here: http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/man1.html
[15:31] <cousteau> so there's no way to do it with xscreensaver-demo
[15:32] <knome> cousteau, just disable the screensaver that gives the error.
[15:32] <cousteau> it's just a warning message, not an error (or if it's an error it can avoid it)
[15:32] <cousteau> the idea is to get that screensaver working
[15:33] <cousteau> which is the main reason why I installed it
[15:33] <knome> cousteau, then ask the screensaver creator

[16:23] <xubuntu336> xubuntu c magnifik
[16:24] <xubuntu336> alo
[16:25] <xubuntu336> j'ai une grosse biloute, qui veut que je lui mette dans la bouche?!

[16:25] <bazhang> xubuntu336, thats offtopic, and not very nice
[17:42] <xubuntu742> I just installed Xubuntu on a USB stick with plugged out all mz hard drives. After finishing installation and reboot it doesn!t boot
[17:42] <xubuntu742> can someone help me
[17:49] <T61_on_the_Fritz> any sound card experts here?
[17:59] <xubuntu614> After I installed Xubuntu 12.04 on a 16GB usb stick it says : Reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press a key
[18:00] <xubuntu614> Why is that for
[18:39] <tjingboem> is it normal that when i use the character " i push that key but also have to press the space bar  after that?  Where can i change this behavior?
[18:44] <jcfp> tjingboem: by setting a different keyboard layout
[18:47] <David-A> tjingboem: you probably pressed the "umlaut diacritical/dead character" and not the "double quote". double quote is usually on a shift key
[18:51] <xubuntu036> I lost the mai top tray. How can I restore to factory settings?
[18:56] <David-A> xubuntu036, come back...
[19:06] <tjingboem> yes keyboard works now better, more to my liking - thanks
[19:30] <xutwooh> so whos here today or we all just hanging out
[19:58] <davygrvy> Having problems with grub.  MBR not being picked-up at boot time.  I have to boot into the 12.04 installer cdrom, then jump to the harddisk.  I tried update-grub followed by grub-install, but no joy.  I'm lost
[20:01] <moetunes> !grub | davygrvy
[20:01] <ubottu> davygrvy: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[20:01] <davygrvy> tnks
[20:22] <davygrvy> grub2 docs are helping.  grub-install should have fixed my problem, but didn't
[20:22] <davygrvy> AREN'T, sorry
[21:16] <Peyam> hi
[21:16] <Peyam> Why doesn't xubuntu recognize Ipod?
[21:16] <Peyam> I tried to install nautilus.. and something else
[21:16] <Peyam> even then i didn't work
[21:19] <Unit193> !ipod

[22:31] <xubuntu686> does anyone here use bblean?
[22:32] <Unit193> Last I knew, bbLean was windows only, but based on Blackbox.
[22:32] <xubuntu686> so it wont/doesnt work on linux?
[22:33] <Unit193> It's based off a Linux WM last I knew, take a look at openbox, it's pretty close.
