[04:11] <phillw> infinity: bug 1086974 Thanks :D
[04:11] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1086974 in libguestfs (Ubuntu Quantal) "libguestfs: error: cannot find any suitable libguestfs supermin" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1086974
[08:46] <tjaalton> who rejected sssd?
[08:46] <tjaalton> again
[08:46] <tjaalton> it has a MRE
[08:47] <infinity> Not I.
[08:47] <infinity> slangasek: ?
[08:47] <slangasek> tjaalton: there were two uploads in the queue, I only rejected the one without the MRE bug ref
[08:47] <tjaalton> wait, this was the old version
[08:47] <tjaalton> yeah
[08:48] <tjaalton> this was rejected once before, how did it end up there again?-)
[08:48] <slangasek> er, beats me
[08:48] <tjaalton> unless I had uploaded it twice
[08:48] <infinity> I imagine someone didn't reject it hard enough. :P
[08:48] <tjaalton> or that
[08:48] <infinity> (Or at all)
[08:49] <infinity> It's actually remarkably difficult for mere mortals to move things from rejected back to unapproved, so it probably wasn't rejected in the first place, just discussed.
[08:49] <tjaalton> I did get a rejection email on dec 28th
[08:50] <infinity> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+queue?queue_state=4&queue_text=sssd
[08:50] <infinity> Or, you uploaded it twice. :P
[08:50] <tjaalton> bah
[08:50] <infinity> With different sources, too.  Different .dsc anyway.
[08:51] <infinity> Anyhow.  Mystery solved.  Back to our regularly scheduled weekend workaholism^whacking^wrest.
[08:53] <tjaalton> yeah, carry on :)
[08:54] <tjaalton> actually, the latest change got in there without a changelog entry..
[08:54] <infinity> Tsk,
[08:54] <infinity> Is that true of the version in the queue, too?
[08:54] <tjaalton> and I could add recent cve fixes there too
[08:54] <infinity> Would you like to quickly replace it?
[08:54] <tjaalton> yeah
[08:54] <infinity> UPLOAD HARDER.
[08:54] <tjaalton> well, just drop it, not like you'll accept it during the weekend anyway :)
[08:55] <infinity> I might.
[08:55] <infinity> I won't accept it in the next few hours, though.
[08:55] <infinity> But my weekend plans are pretty thrilling, and mostly involve SRUs, both my own and others.
[08:55] <infinity> Maybe punctuated with some gin.
[08:56] <tjaalton> hendricks, tanqueray or bombay?-)
[08:56] <infinity> Tanq No. 10.
[08:57] <infinity> At least, that's what's on the desk right now *flails at his gin*.
[08:57] <tjaalton> mm
[08:58] <tjaalton> so I'll prepare a new upload and include the security fixes too
[08:58] <tjaalton> feel free to reject the current one, quantal too
[08:58] <infinity> Shiny.  Going to reuse the version number?  If so, I'll reject the current one right now before someone accidentally accepts.
[08:59] <tjaalton> yeah

[09:48] <infinity> Laney: Done.
[09:48] <Laney> Danke
[09:49] <infinity> We really need that whole proposed-aware component-mismatches, like, yesterday.
[09:49] <infinity> It's the only way I ever notice these pending MIRs. :/
[09:49] <Laney> Yeah. Wasn't someone working on that?
