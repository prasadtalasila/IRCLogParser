[04:07] <jbicha> darkxst: um, not exactly; the staging ppa is nice because it's a team effort
[04:10] <jbicha> the staging ppa really is prep work for the gnome3 ppa, whereas I see the ricotz testing ppa as a way to get near nightly builds without having to compile it yourself or use jhbuild
[12:41] <ricotz> darkxst, hi, i see you are interested in mozjs187 you might want to give the last g-s/gjs/mozjs packages in ppa:ricotz/staging a try
[12:41] <ricotz> happy new year!
[20:52] <darkxst>  ricotz, sure will try them out
[21:21] <darkxst> ricotz, gnome-sushi needs to be rebuilt against js187
[21:31] <ricotz> darkxst, yes, i know
[21:34] <ricotz> darkxst, are you aware of a newer snapshot than this one from april, or even the creation process of that tarball?
[21:35] <darkxst> ricotz, just looking at that now, since that snapshot did not fix leaks I see
[21:35] <ricotz> ok, thanks
[21:40] <darkxst> just seems to be a couple of minor patches, perhaps we could build directly off the hg branch
[21:40] <darkxst> https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr17/
[21:45] <ricotz> darkxst, afaics there are quite some patches which can't be ignored
[21:46] <ricotz> i was hoping they are available somewhere
[21:47] <darkxst> ricotz, library name patches are here https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=628723
[21:47] <ubot5> Mozilla bug 628723 in JavaScript Engine "Create JS 1.8.5 source release" [Normal,Resolved: fixed]
[21:49] <darkxst> you can see everything that was done for the 185 release here https://bitbucket.org/wesgarland/js-1.8.5/
[21:50] <darkxst> other than that, there were a couple of patches to fix tests, but I can't find them anywhere https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=735599#c7
[21:50] <ubot5> Mozilla bug 735599 in JavaScript Engine "Create JS 1.8.7 source release" [Normal,New]
[21:59] <darkxst> anyway would make more sense to apply the patches as distro patches, since mozilla clearly arent interested in releasing standalone releases anymore
[22:01] <ricotz> thanks
[22:01] <ricotz> yeah, seems to be so
[23:09] <darkxst> ricotz, http://pastebin.com/M7KsJHfS
[23:11] <darkxst> so seems to just be, this with s/5/7, https://bitbucket.org/wesgarland/js-1.8.5/raw/cf58d9c277c7c4f1dc173ebe8814fa300f4abd84/patches/libname-changes.patch
[23:12] <darkxst> and this https://bug735599.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=618606
[23:12] <darkxst> and the test diff above
[23:23] <darkxst> ricotz, btw this is the branch that the current tarball is based off https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr10
