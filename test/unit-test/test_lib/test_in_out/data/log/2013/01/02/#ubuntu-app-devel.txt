[18:10] <hippiehacker> https://gist.github.com/4436283 # trying to get firefox to create a profile on first run that includes specific CAs (or at least add one)
[20:01] <JanC> hippiehacker: why do you need that?
[20:20] <hippiehacker> https://gist.github.com/4436283#comment-695263 # I have a custom app that generates a self-signed certificate during the OEM OOBE for ubuntu, I need firefox to be able to connect securely to that site without user interaction
[20:21] <hippiehacker> I'm getting close, but I'm confused as to why the Google-CA is force added when I specifically start with a https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:UserCertDB that has only one entry
[20:22] <hippiehacker> It also seems strange that I would need to populate /usr/lib/firefox/defaults/profile instead of /etc/firefox/profile or something
[20:25] <JanC> hippiehacker: the Google cert might be injected for Google's malware protection service
[20:28] <JanC> otherwise the user would get questions about that cert when Firefox checks whether your site is listed as hosting malware
[20:29] <JanC> (it's still a bit sneaky to do it that way, of course)
[21:34] <mobilenoob> Hello. I try to follow the Ubuntu QML toolkit preview install and this shows up: W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ui-toolkit/ppa/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found
[21:36] <mobilenoob> Is the repository missing this part on purpose or should I do something else?
[22:22] <hippiehacker> https://gist.github.com/4436283#comment-695471 I've noticed that as I continue to browse, I get no notices, but the certs stored in the compiled shared-lib.so get automatically readded 8(
[22:22] <hippiehacker> I'd like to have a bit more control over who my computer trusts
