[09:40] <Hanmac_> some big news about 13.04? is the gnome-classic package still continues? what about the lightdm + xserver? (i had freaky problems recently)

[13:12] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[14:46] <BluesKaj> The daily build Kubuntu 13.04 still won't install , I'm using noapci and nomodest to get to the desktop , but ubiquity just sits there in the install phase and does nothing , obviously totally hung .
[14:47] <BluesKaj> using the live-dvd
[15:50] <mn2010> why is fglrx so unstable with X Server 1.13.1.901
[15:51] <mn2010> x has crashed atleast 14 times in the last 48 hours.
[16:01] <ikonia> mn2010: ask AMD
[16:02] <mn2010> -_- i wish i could... there about as helpful as asking a cinderblock...
[16:02] <ikonia> they are the ones who make it
[16:02] <ikonia> so no point asking us about closed source components
[16:03] <mn2010> i know... i was just hoping for some strange relief that its a easy fix / eg xorg.conf...

[18:10] <BluesKaj> tried the 3.8-rc2 kernel , but it couldn't find apport on 12.10 ...must be a flaw
[18:40] <peterrus> hi, is it currently possible to install the 3.7.1 kernel or something relatively close (newer than 3.6.3-quantal) on quantal? I don't want to use a mainline kernel
[18:41] <jtaylor> of course its possible
[18:42] <jtaylor> there should even be backport packages from the kernel team somewhere, but you won't get any support
[18:43] <peterrus> jtaylor, yes I should have phrased that differently ;)
[18:43] <peterrus> the real question is, where do I find it
[18:43] <jtaylor> that seems to be the newest one available for quantal http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.7-rc2-quantal/
[18:43] <peterrus> x-swat seems to have backports from quantal to precise and from raring to precise
[18:44] <peterrus> jtaylor, yes, but that is a mainline kernel
[18:44] <peterrus> which doesn't work with dkms + nvidia-current
[18:44] <peterrus> which Is just what I need to test some things in order to resolve a bug
[18:44] <peterrus> or rather, pinpoint it, to avoid sounding too pretentious ;)
[18:45] <peterrus> so what I would need is a backport of the raring kernel to quantal indeed.
[18:45] <jtaylor> you can try compiling the raring kernel in quantal
[18:46] <peterrus> I have found this, but that is for precise
[18:46] <peterrus> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/r-lts-backport
[18:47] <peterrus> jtaylor, could do that indeed, but it seems odd that no one has done this yet
[18:48] <peterrus> well, I will use xorg-edgers for now I suppose
[19:00] <mn2010> any guide to ubuntu packaging, and setting up a automated repository?
[19:04] <Pici> !packaging
[19:04] <ubottu> The packaging guide is at http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/  - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages for information on getting a package integrated into Ubuntu - Other developer resources are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment - See also !backports and !sponsoring
[19:06] <mn2010> what about local repository's, running a mix-branch of ubuntu-raring. behind a closed intranet.

[19:54] <blair> is anybody running raring and wants to confirm a core dump in /sbin/init?
[19:55] <dkessel> i also have a bug to confirm, so yes :)
[19:56] <blair> be careful, you won't be able to recover unless you can boot from another CD or mount the root partition
[19:56] <blair> touch /forcefsck and reboot.  the bug is described https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/1096531
[19:56] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1096531 in upstart (Ubuntu) "After touch /forcefsck and reboot: Assertion failed in log_clear_unflushed" [Undecided,New]
[19:56] <dkessel> i'll make a snapshot of the vm then
[19:56] <blair> and what's your bug?
[19:57] <dkessel> ok I'll try that
[19:58] <dkessel> if have this one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/signon-ui/+bug/1097423
[19:58] <ubottu> Error: ubuntu bug 1097423 not found
[19:58] <dkessel> steps to reproduce are included
[19:58] <dkessel> hmm not found?
[19:58] <blair> URL doesn't load for me either
[19:58] <dkessel> i can see it
[19:58] <dkessel> oh it is marked as private...
[19:59] <dkessel> nvm... touching /forcefsck
[20:01] <dkessel> let's see if this is reproducable with the desktop install
[20:04] <dkessel> blair, not reproducable here, sorry
[20:04] <blair> dkessel, ok, thanks for checking it out
[20:05] <dkessel> yet there might be a difference between server and desktop images that causes that. i'll start the server image
[20:05] <mn2010> i did that a week ago, with no problems
[21:12] <user82_> !info kernel-image
[21:12] <ubottu> Package kernel-image does not exist in raring
[21:12] <user82_> !info linux-image
[21:12] <ubottu> linux-image (source: linux-meta): Generic Linux kernel image.. In component main, is optional. Version 3.7.0.7.11 (raring), package size 1 kB, installed size 32 kB
