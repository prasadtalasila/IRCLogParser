[00:01] <satanx> coolthanks for the info
[00:05] <Joe> Hello, I am looking to install Xubuntu, it will be my first Linux based OS
[00:05] <Joe> I have a question on what I should download
[00:05] <genoobie> Joe, what's your hardware?
[00:06] <genoobie> oh and welcome!
[00:06] <Joe> I have found an old Dell Dimension 4600 and I am coming from nothing but Windows. I have 512 mb RAM and Intel Pentium 4 2.8 GHz and other than that, I have no idea what information is required haha
[00:06] <genoobie> seems ok
[00:06] <genoobie> you may want to consider lubuntu too
[00:07] <genoobie> what kind of video?
[00:07] <genoobie> although it will probably be fine
[00:07] <Joe> I was at an Ubuntu chat and they suggest Xubuntu as it should be able to handle it
[00:07] <Joe> Um one second let me check
[00:07] <genoobie> here a good comparison
[00:07] <genoobie> http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/Lubuntu_vs_Xubuntu
[00:07] <Joe> Is it the video card you are asking for?
[00:08] <Joe> *graphics card
[00:08] <genoobie> xubuntu looks good, looks better than lubuntu, but performance in lubuntu is prolly better
[00:09] <Joe> According to that my old tower meets the optimal specs for Xubuntu so I am probably just trying out Xubuntu first off
[00:09] <genoobie> yes, xubuntu is a tiny bit resource heavy on graphics versus say lubuntu
[00:09] <genoobie> fine
[00:09] <satanx> Joe, apt-get install unetbootin
[00:09] <Joe> I was in another chat earlier and they suggested Xubuntu to me and it's worth a shot
[00:09] <genoobie> satanx, he doesn't have any OS on there now
[00:10] <Joe> Correct, I formatted the hard drive
[00:10] <satanx> what os you useing atm joe?
[00:10] <Joe> On what I wish to install I have no OS installed
[00:10] <satanx> so blank drive atm?
[00:10] <Joe> Correct
[00:10] <genoobie> get 12.10 i386
[00:10] <genoobie> not the alternate install
[00:11] <Joe> Okay what is the difference between 12.04 alternate an d desktop?
[00:11] <satanx> you got another pc you can make a disk or something?
[00:11] <Joe> Yes, I can make a bootable flash drive
[00:11] <genoobie> get desktop
[00:11] <Joe> Desktop is the iso file?
[00:11] <genoobie> both are .iso files
[00:11] <genoobie> if your dell 4600 can boot from the USB then use that
[00:12] <satanx> id try freebsd imo
[00:12] <Joe> Ah what is the difference? Because I am not sure how much hard drive space I have as I had to dig out an old one
[00:12] <saltmiser> Cheri703, sounds ilke your 3D graphics hardware is either not supported correctly or is broken
[00:12] <genoobie> ugh freebsd has not much in the way of hardware support
[00:12] <saltmiser> genoobie, no that will run Xubuntu just fine
[00:12] <genoobie> saltmiser, yes, but for the install his cdrom is prolly older
[00:13] <saltmiser> I wouldn't worry about that
[00:13] <genoobie> meh
[00:13] <saltmiser> he only has to use the CDROM once
[00:13] <satanx> joe stay away from unity
[00:13] <genoobie> yes
[00:13] <saltmiser> yes
[00:13] <genoobie> no unity
[00:13] <saltmiser> away from unity
[00:13]  * saltmiser hisses
[00:13] <genoobie> so the alternate install may not be a bad option
[00:13] <Joe> Okay will do.
[00:13] <genoobie> if you don't mind text interfaces
[00:13] <genoobie> and nCurses
[00:13] <saltmiser> he does
[00:13] <saltmiser> he will
[00:13] <Joe> What is the difference between alternate and desktop install?
[00:13] <saltmiser> it will be scary
[00:13] <saltmiser> Joe use the desktop
[00:13] <saltmiser> the alternate install will ask you a bunch of questions that you'll have no idea how to answer
[00:13] <genoobie> doesn't desktop rely on unity for enviro?
[00:13] <satanx> 2nd that
[00:13] <saltmiser> not xubuntu
[00:14] <genoobie> oh
[00:14] <satanx> not for xubuntu
[00:14] <Joe> But the alternate requires less free space and I am not sure how much I have currently
[00:14] <saltmiser> Joe, you're going to format the entire hard drive
[00:14] <genoobie> interesting for lubuntu which is lighter, it uses unity
[00:14] <satanx> xubuntu uses xfce
[00:14] <genoobie> you'll have plenty of space
[00:14] <saltmiser> Joe, you have enough disk space
[00:14] <saltmiser> you have at least 4gb probably
[00:14] <satanx> but you can add w/e ui u wish
[00:14] <Joe> It already is formated. It's from an old Windows 98 computer though so I'm limited :p
[00:14] <saltmiser> joe, the installer will re-format it
[00:14] <saltmiser> specifically for linux
[00:15] <saltmiser> linux uses different file system formats than windows, especially
[00:15] <genoobie> everything is a file in linux
[00:15] <Joe> Okay I will try the Desktop version but if I do not have enough space I will try the alternate as well
[00:15] <satanx> joe, it you are a beginner linux useer... i would try ubuntu 10.04 first
[00:15] <genoobie> a mouse, that's a file
[00:15] <genoobie> :)
[00:15] <saltmiser> you will have enough space joe, do not worry
[00:15] <genoobie> nah
[00:15] <genoobie> 12.04 is prolly fine
[00:15] <saltmiser> satanx, stop playing satan that sounds ridiculous
[00:15] <Joe> I was suggested Xubuntu as it should run smoother on my Dimension 4600
[00:15] <genoobie> yes
[00:16] <genoobie> because ubuntu uses unity
[00:16] <saltmiser> Joe xubuntu 12.04 or 12.10
[00:16] <Joe> So 12.10 or 12.04 desktop version?
[00:16] <saltmiser> either version, doesn't matter
[00:16] <genoobie> it's heavy
[00:16] <satanx> saltmiser, what should i play?
[00:16] <saltmiser> I use 12.10 I think
[00:16] <genoobie> 12.10 has no problems here
[00:16] <Joe> Alright I'll try it with 12.10 first, thanks!
[00:16] <saltmiser> Joe, have it format the entire hard drive
[00:16] <genoobie> yes
[00:16] <saltmiser> blow the whole thing out
=== satanx is now known as Mom_sex
[00:16] <Joe> Will it ask me that during install?
[00:16] <saltmiser> yes
[00:16] <Mom_sex> saltmiser, better?
[00:16] <genoobie> will he need to make his own swap?
[00:17] <Joe> Okay I will indeed do that. Thank you
[00:17] <saltmiser> no
[00:17] <saltmiser> autopartition will
[00:17] <genoobie> or will the install take care of that
[00:17] <genoobie> ok
[00:17] <saltmiser> lol
[00:17] <saltmiser> I remember when I used slackware for the first time
[00:17] <Joe> I must go for now, hwoever I should have time to install it within the week. Thank you for the asistance!
=== Mom_sex is now known as saltmiser2
[00:17] <saltmiser2> there
[00:17] <genoobie> I remember partitioning for each /etc, /var and /tmp
[00:17] <genoobie> it was ridiculous
[00:17] <saltmiser> yeah
[00:17] <saltmiser> freaking openbsd
[00:18] <genoobie> you had to reinstall all the time so you wanted to keep data on another partition
[00:18] <saltmiser2> whats wrong with bsd?
[00:18] <timm> 2 questions:1. is there a way to change the clock to an hour ahead? 2. everytime i close my netbook and it goes to sleep I need to restart Xubuntu, is there any way to fix this? I am on am aspire one acer netbook.
[00:18] <saltmiser2> timm goto poweroptions
[00:19] <timm> okay ,saltmiser2
[00:20] <genoobie> bbl
[00:20] <saltmiser2> er.. power mannagerment is what they call it
[00:21] <timm> so i want to put when laptop lid closes suspend? salmiser2
[00:22] <saltmiser2> yes
[00:22] <timm> okay thanks.
[00:22] <timm> and then for the clock
[00:22] <saltmiser2> one min
[00:23] <timm> okay thanks
[00:24] <saltmiser2> im not sure about that might need new applet, you need to google that
[00:24] <saltmiser2> still looking
[00:24] <timm> I just got it
[00:25] <saltmiser2> right on good
[00:25] <timm> system>time and date
=== saltmiser2 is now known as Nerkshank
[00:25] <timm> from the main menu
[00:25] <Nerkshank> good to know
[00:26] <timm> yup
[00:26] <timm> i guess this is how you learn
[00:30] <Nerkshank> yep
[00:32] <Nerkshank> question: why cant i upgrade to 12.XX
[00:32] <Nerkshank> say i need to make cd?
[00:34] <Nerkshank> please help http://pastebin.com/8ehSwXGW
[01:03] <timm> nerkshank, no idea
[01:03] <xubuntu807> hello
[01:04] <Boom_Farmer> Nerkshank: It's looking for the CD because it thinks you're wanting to upgrade from a CD. Is there an option to do a network upgrade?
[01:04] <Boom_Farmer> Or to upgrade from the Internet?
[01:05] <xubuntu807> having trouble connecting to protected next
[01:06] <xubuntu807> networks
[01:07] <xubuntu807> can anyone help me
[01:07] <xubuntu807> this started a couple days ago, after a update
[01:09] <xubuntu807> anyone??
[01:09] <saltmiser> jmm
[01:09] <Boom_Farmer> What sort of "protection" do they employ?
[01:09] <saltmiser> well I don't use any of that
[01:09] <saltmiser> and indeed, what do you mean by protected?
[01:10] <Nerkshank> Boom_Farmer, you were right cd-repositry was checked 4 some reason
[01:10] <xubuntu807> wpa1/2
[01:13] <timm> xubuntu807,can you connect to the same network on the LAN?
[01:14] <xubuntu807> I can, and I can also connecct when the network is open.
[01:14] <timm> hmm
[01:15] <timm> can you change the type of security on the network?
[01:15] <timm> and see if that works, xubunutu807
[01:16] <timm> xubuntu807
[01:16] <xubuntu807> Ill try that.
[01:17] <timm> and double check that you've got the right password
[01:17] <Joe> I have a quick question about Xubuntu. I read in Ubuntu there is an option to test and not install the OS. Does Xubuntu offer this as well?
[01:18] <xubuntu807> Okay.
[01:19] <timm> joe, yes if you burn it to a disk or flash drive it offers that opion
[01:19] <Boom_Farmer> Yes, there are Xubuntu Live distributions, if you get the Desktop LiveCD or live thumb drive ISO.
[01:19] <Joe> Okay, thank you. And I have been looknig around and it seems quite simple to dual boot Xubuntu and Windows Vista, is that correct?
[01:19] <xubuntu807> Hmm... Now it's saying that my wireless card is not managed.
[01:20] <Boom_Farmer> Usually.
[01:20] <Nerkshank> lol you got vista still
[01:20] <Joe> This is an old PC, I also ahve 7 and 8\
[01:20] <Joe> I am looking to alternatives to my even older that ran Xp :p
[01:20] <Nerkshank> i got a brand new hp i dont use it you want it
[01:21] <Joe> The 12.10 torrent download on the Xubuntu website offers the tes twithout install?
[01:21] <Nerkshank> ersion
[01:22] <timm> joe, the hardest part of running a daul boot of windows and ubuntu is resizing the windows storage partion
[01:22] <Nerkshank> what is cmd to how linux version?
[01:22] <Nerkshank> show*
[01:22] <Boom_Farmer> To resize the Windows partition, boot into Windows and use Windows' tools to resize it.
[01:22] <Joe> Why is it difficult?
[01:23] <Boom_Farmer> Nerkshank: either `cat /etc/issue` or `uname -a`
[01:23] <Joe> Okay thank you
[01:23] <Nerkshank> uname ty
[01:23] <timm> boom_farmer, I had a hell of a time resizing mine.
[01:24] <timm> turrned out my partion was corrupt
[01:24] <frustratedtech> have to disable pagesys files first
[01:24] <Nerkshank> Boom_Farmer, its easy
[01:24] <frustratedtech> remove those then resize, then add them back
[01:24] <Nerkshank> you got windows loaded rigtht now?
[01:25] <Nerkshank> ill walk u throught
[01:25] <genoobie> urgh
[01:26] <genoobie> has anyone used the alternate install?
[01:26] <genoobie> anyhow the question is this
[01:26] <genoobie> I had a linux on /sda3 that I want to blow out
[01:26] <genoobie> I want to install xubuntu over it
[01:27] <genoobie> what's the difference between "resuse partition" and use "entire partition"?
[01:27] <Nerkshank> entire willl wipe everything
[01:27] <genoobie> will wipe everything in the partition?
[01:27] <genoobie> because that's OK
[01:27] <Nerkshank> yes
[01:27] <genoobie> I'm blowing out sda3 anyhow
[01:28] <genoobie> what does "reuse" do then?
[01:28] <Nerkshank> might try and recover some files
[01:28] <genoobie> okay, gotcha, nah, full wipeout would be fine
[01:28] <Nerkshank> if u want to wipe are fresh install to entire
[01:29] <genoobie> would it reuse sda2 as my swap that I already ahve set up
[01:29] <Nerkshank> i would make a 2nd swap for your new partition
[01:29] <Nerkshank> 2-5gs or so
[01:29] <genoobie> huh?
[01:29] <genoobie> why?
[01:30] <Nerkshank> how many hhd u working with?
[01:30] <genoobie> one
[01:30] <genoobie> only one OS at a time
[01:30] <genoobie> the other is a windows OS
[01:31] <Nerkshank> you might beable to get by with the one swap... dont qutoe me on that tho
[01:31] <genoobie> do I want the bootable flag on or off
[01:32] <Nerkshank> you have efu bios?
[01:32] <Nerkshank> efi*
[01:32] <genoobie> not sure
[01:32] <genoobie> what is efi bios?
[01:32] <genoobie> I don't think so...
[01:32] <Nerkshank> make it bootable and grub should find windows for dual boot
[01:32] <Unit193> !uefi
[01:32] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[01:34] <Nerkshank> best to find a guide to help u install
[01:35] <timm> i manged to do a dual boot last night, took me till 3:30AM
[01:36] <Nerkshank> dod you install linux first then windows>
[01:36] <Nerkshank> always install linux over windows
[01:37] <timm> linux over windows, turned out my main partion was corrupt
[01:37] <timm> i go it delt with
[01:37] <Nerkshank> ya can be a pain
[01:38] <Nerkshank> microsoft hates linux
[01:41] <timm> In my opion linux is better
[01:42] <timm> like i got so much support last night
[01:42] <timm> service you cant get with windows
[01:48] <Boom_Farmer> timm: You can get that service for Windows, it'll just cost you money.
[01:48] <timm> but not that fast.
[01:48] <timm> you come on here you get help in like 5 minutes
[02:05] <satanxx> is there like a hardware manager for xubuntu... id like to see if my gtx660m driver is up to date
[02:06] <Boom_Farmer> satanxx: Try XFCE Menu > Settings > Additional Drivers
[02:08] <satanxx> no such options
[02:12] <Boom_Farmer> Which version are you using? run `cat /etc/issue` in a terminal.
[02:13] <Cheri703> satanxx: additional drivers is in the "software sources" screen on xubuntu
[02:13] <Cheri703> so settings > software sources > additional drivers tab
[02:13] <Cheri703> on 12.10 at least
[02:18] <satanxx> !list
[02:18] <ubottu> satanxx: No warez here! This is not a file sharing channel (or network); read the channel topic. If you're looking for information about me, type « /msg ubottu !bot ». If you're looking for a channel, see « /msg ubottu !alis ».
[02:19] <Boom_Farmer> So is that why people say !list on joining.
[02:24] <timm> Boom_Farmer, what type of computer you on?
[02:25] <Boom_Farmer> timm: Xubuntu 12.04, probably upgraded to 12.04 from 11.10 by dist-upgrade, Intel i5 with discrete graphics.
[02:26] <timm> desktop, or laptop?
[02:27] <Boom_Farmer> timm: Yes.
[02:27] <timm> it was an either or question
[02:28] <Boom_Farmer> Both. It's a laptop, but it spends most of its time plugged into the wall and an external monitor.
[02:30] <timm> oh, im on my netbook(xubuntu of course) never run this fast on windows ive got skype open and  playing a video with only 73% RAM used up Boom_Farmer
[02:31] <Boom_Farmer> 73% of how much?
[02:31] <timm> 1 gig
[02:31] <Boom_Farmer> I'm using about 4 GB (3.5GB RAM and then a bit of swap) but then I've had web browsers open for three days.
[02:32] <timm> XD why
[02:32] <Boom_Farmer> Because that's my use case? My computer idles overnight. And I use open tabs as reminders of projects.
[02:34] <satanxx> so.... i got a nvidia gtx660m... i cant find correct drivers any suggestion?
[02:34] <satanxx> i got 16g mem :p
[02:36] <Boom_Farmer> satanxx: The latest Nvidia driver should work for you. Your card is listed as supported on http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-ia32-310.32-driver.html
[02:37] <Boom_Farmer> Alternately, just plug your card info in here: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us
[02:57] <xubuntu762> Hello, I currently have a problem in which I cannot connect to any wifi networks, regardless of security. This happened after I installed updates a few days ago. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[02:57] <Boom_Farmer> Is upgrading from XFCE 4.8 to 4.10 in 12.04 as simple as adding a ppa, apt-get update, then apt-get upgrade? http://it-diary.com/tutorials/install-xfce-4-10-in-ubuntu-12-04-lts-precise-pangolin/
[02:57] <Boom_Farmer> xubuntu762: Can you see the networks?
[02:58] <xubuntu762> I can see the networks, Boom_Farmer.
[02:58] <Boom_Farmer> Do you currently have passwords listed for those networks? You might try deleting the setting for a network and re-adding it.
[02:59] <xubuntu762> I do. deleting...
[03:01] <xubuntu762> I had no results after re-adding.
[03:01] <Boom_Farmer> Is it saving the settings correctly?
[03:02] <xubuntu762> I would assume so; I never had a problem with it before.
[03:03] <Boom_Farmer> open the settings dialog and check that things like the authentication and inner authentication match what you know about the network.
[03:05] <xubuntu762> Alright, I have entered everything I know about the network...
[03:11] <xubuntu762> Still nothing...
[03:41] <Boom_Farmer> "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
[03:41] <Boom_Farmer> Make sure you saved the changes, then reboot and see if the changes stuck.
[03:42] <xubuntu762> I have tried that. Even trying a USB wifi adapter doesn't work.
[03:43] <Boom_Farmer> Change the settings to something you know is wrong, save them, and reboot. See if those changes stuck.
[03:43] <Boom_Farmer> I'm wondering if the permissions are being saved.
[03:45] <xubuntu762> Okay, I will try that.
[03:47] <xubuntu762> The changes carried through.
[03:48] <xubuntu779> how do I check what version of xubuntu I have?
[03:48] <Jeff_Williams> Hello i jsut installed linux for the first time :)
[03:52] <Boom_Farmer> xubuntu779: In a terminal, run: cat /etc/issue
[03:52] <Jeff_Williams> i also need help xubuntu wont update any apps
[03:53] <Boom_Farmer> Jeff_Williams: How are you trying to upfate?
[03:54] <Jeff_Williams> the update manager
[03:55] <Jeff_Williams> ok its staring to do something
[03:55] <xubuntu016> hello im running an aspire one acer netbook and im wondering if i can dim the screen on it and how
[03:55] <xubuntu016> on xbuntu
[03:55] <Boom_Farmer> xubuntu016: Do the Fn+whatever keys work?
[03:56] <Jeff_Williams> ok it told me to re start
[03:56] <xubuntu016> olny for audio
[03:56] <xubuntu016> only*
[03:56] <Boom_Farmer> xubuntu016: Is there a small sun-like object in your bar?
[03:57] <xubuntu016> nope.
[03:58] <Boom_Farmer> Right click on the bar, click "Panel", "Add New Items", "Brightness plugin", "Add"
[03:59] <xubuntu762> Any headway on the wifi problem? I wonder if it happened because of a recent update...
[03:59] <xubuntu016> i dont see a brightness plugin or anything like that
[04:00] <Boom_Farmer> xubuntu762: There's a chance. Check for more updates?
[04:01] <xubuntu762> Everything is up to date, Boom_Farmer.
[04:04] <Boom_Farmer> xubuntu016: sudo apt-get install xfce4-goodies, then look again.
[04:04] <Boom_Farmer> xubuntu762: I don't know what to tell you, then. Take it to ubuntuforums, perhaps. I'm not a dev, just a user.
[04:05] <xubuntu762> Alright, thanks anyway.
[04:05] <Boom_Farmer> Sorry I couldn't help you.
[04:05] <Boom_Farmer> When you make your forum post, write down _everything_ you tried, to save you time.
[04:06] <xubuntu762> Okay, thanks for the tip. At least ethernet works...
[04:07] <Jeff_Williams> ok my i ask can i just do sudo apt-get install skype to download and install skype im still pretty new to this
[04:12] <xubuntu016> Boom_farmer, from terminal?
[04:14] <xubuntu016> installing
[04:17] <xubuntu016> boom_farmer, nothing

[08:48] <Aknot> If i install enlightenment. Will it know to use EFM when using e17 and thunar when using xfce? And if i have torrents downloading can i continue them when switching between e17 and xfce
[08:55] <moetunes> yes and depends on the torrent client
[08:58] <Aknot> transmission
[09:00] <Aknot> And if i download bunch of themes and icons, do they work on both? or do i have to download them separately
[09:00] <qasim> hi
[09:03] <ochosi> Aknot: afaik E17 uses its own toolkit (i.e. neither Gtk nor Qt), so i don't think our themes would work there
[09:03] <Aknot> but ive watched videos on utube where he uses gtk 3 stuff
[09:04] <qasim> can anyone tell me how to play blue ray videos..... i have vlc but it doesnot work properly with bue rays
[09:04] <ochosi> Aknot: right, well you can ofc use gtk apps in a qt context or even in enlightenment, but i was referring to any E17 native stuff (if there is any, i have no clue really)
[09:06] <Aknot> okok
[09:16] <gnomefreak> he left :(

[09:44] <TheSheep> Juan_Moreno: start xfce4-mixer and check both your hardware device and the pulseaudio playback
[09:46] <Juan_Moreno> xfce4-mixer?
[09:46] <Juan_Moreno> i have pulse audio voume control
[09:47] <Juan_Moreno> i've dl it

[13:24] <xubuntu427> can someone help me
[13:24] <xubuntu427> ?
[13:24] <xubuntu427> i wanna install win xp and xbuntu
[13:24] <GridCube> !dualboot | xubuntu427
[13:24] <ubottu> xubuntu427: Dual boot instructions: x86/AMD64: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/Windows - Macs: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro https://help.ubuntu.com/community/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot
[13:24] <xubuntu427> i have raw ntfs 150 Gb
[13:25] <xubuntu427> on acer aspire one
[13:25] <GridCube> xubuntu427, the installer ask you if you want to install alongside your other os, then takes care of all the work, just be sure to backup important data before starting
[13:26] <xubuntu427> there is no data :)
[13:26] <xubuntu427> only 150 Gb unpartitioned
[13:26] <xubuntu427> now im asking how to divide?
[13:26] <xubuntu427> 50:50?
[13:27] <xubuntu427> half ntfs and half fat32?
[13:27] <knome> depends on your needs. do you need to share files a lot? how much are you going to use windows and xubuntu?
[13:28] <xubuntu427> im trying to learn to use linux
[13:28] <xubuntu427> windows is for media and arduino
[13:29] <knome> how much would be enough space for your windows installation?
[13:31] <GridCube> if its xp 30gb its more than ennough
[13:32] <xubuntu427> what os is better to install first?
[13:32] <GridCube> xp
[13:33] <xubuntu427> ok
[13:33] <GridCube> xubuntu427, read the links i pasted you
[13:33] <xubuntu427> im reading
[13:34] <xubuntu427> xbunt and ubuntu is no diference?
[13:35] <knome> xubuntu427, in this case, no difference
[13:35] <GridCube> ^^^ what knome said
[13:37] <xubuntu427> can xbuntu read ntfs partition?
[13:37] <GridCube> yes
[13:45] <xubuntu427> so i decided... ill make 60 Gb windows partition and install windows.
[13:45] <GridCube> if you are making partitions now, make already the swap partition too
[13:46] <GridCube> give it twice your ram minimum
[13:48] <xubuntu427> im makeing them with windows installer
[13:48] <xubuntu427> i dont think ill be able to do more than 1 for windows
[13:48] <GridCube> that wont work good though
[13:48] <xubuntu427> ?
[13:48] <xubuntu427> why?
[13:49] <GridCube> because windows doesnt play well with other OS's
[13:49] <GridCube> you should make you partition with gparted, or from windows use a third party partitioning tool
[13:50] <xubuntu427> i have nothiong on computer
[13:51] <xubuntu427> all i have is 1x usb win xp
[13:51] <xubuntu427> and 1x usb xbuntu
[13:51] <GridCube> well, that should do it then :)
[13:51] <GridCube> the xubuntu one does have gparted on it
[13:51] <GridCube> :D
[13:51] <xubuntu427> hehe
[13:52] <torax> just wondering about swap, that it should be twice your ram
[13:56] <xubuntu427> so i make another usb drive with ubuntu and i make partitions
[13:57] <xubuntu427> so they look like this?  C: 58Gb , D: 90, E: 2Gb (swap)
[13:58] <holstein> to windows?
[13:59] <holstein> i wouldnt use windows to create the linux partition
[13:59] <holstein> i would use gparted from a live CD
[13:59] <holstein> or, just make free empty space in windows if you prefer and use the installer to create the partitions
[13:59] <xubuntu427> so i just run windows instalation and make one partition 60 gb install windows?
[14:00] <holstein> xubuntu427: depends on what you want
[14:00] <torax> xubuntu427: you can make all the partitions in live CD
[14:01] <GridCube> xubuntu427, as said, use gparted from the xubuntu installer first, then just let windows install in its partition
[14:01] <holstein> if you are new to linux, i would just make free space and let the installer just use the empty space
[14:06] <xubuntu427> jeah, i tried that, and it just installed over windows :)
[14:06] <holstein> xubuntu427: it?
[14:07] <holstein> xubuntu427: "it" just does what you ask.. if you ask the installer to use the entire disk, it will
[14:07] <xubuntu427> yeah, i marked alongside option
[14:07] <holstein> xubuntu427: what are you trying to do?
[14:07] <xubuntu427> dual boot xbuntu/win xp
[14:08] <holstein> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
[14:08] <xubuntu427> i have 150 gb unpartitioned
[14:08] <holstein> xubuntu427: i usually just install windows, first, leaving empty space, then install linux
[14:08] <holstein> if windows is already installed, i just shrink the ntfs partition to reclaim the space
[14:09] <holstein> xubuntu427: you might have a scenario with grub didnt "see" or "find" the winows install.. i usually run 'sudo update-grub' and all is well
[14:09] <xubuntu427> i wanted to do that but someone said that i better do partitions with gparted
[14:09] <holstein> xubuntu427: theres a different in "it just installed over windows", and "grub didnt automatically make a windows entry
[14:10] <holstein> xubuntu427: sure... what i would *not* do, is make linux partitions with windows
[14:10] <xubuntu427> so my windows are still somwhere?
[14:10] <holstein> xubuntu427: i dont know what your system is like, but if you didnt install over the ntfs partition, then its there
[14:10] <holstein> the installer did what you asked it to do
[14:11] <holstein> !grub is a nice resource

[18:44] <Grandpa_smasher> AR9485 i mean
[19:11] <craigbass1976> I shut the lid on my laptop.  When I open it back up, the password window is VERY dim.  AFter I type in the password, all of XFCE is dim.  If I go to a new login, that screen is bright, but once I login in agian I'm back at the dim password screen
[19:21] <craigbass1976> However, if I log out (using the dim screen after I've unlocked it) things are fine when I come back into a fresh XFCE.  Anyone run into this?  It used to happen to me every once in a while, but the girl who owns the laptop now seems to have it happening more often.

[19:47] <sobiwankenobi> hello i was wondering if anyone could help me figure out some issues i am having with the xubuntu install
[19:48] <sobiwankenobi> anybody online?
[19:48] <pAt__> sobiwankenobi, don't ask to ask, pls just ask and wait patiently and see if somebody will answer.
[19:51] <sobiwankenobi> just checking pat, not to familiar with irc
[19:52] <pAt__> ok, no problem sobiwankenobi
[19:52] <pAt__> just explain your problems in detail and wait a while
[19:58] <sobiwankenobi> sure, i am attempting to install xubuntu 12.10 in virtualbox on my windows 7 machine. the installation runs smoothly until I reach the point where I need to create my user name and password. at this point i cannot type anything into the fields. i am able to use the mouse just fine, but the keyboard does not work
=== nosrepa is now known as aperson
[20:23] <Cheri703> sobiwankenobi: perhaps make sure virtualbox is capturing the keyboard properly?
[20:28] <the_guy> Im looking for a good music playing program that will organize a big volume of music and allow me to edit the tags
[20:28] <Cheri703> Might check out amarok? I like it. :)
[20:29] <the_guy> ill try that :)
[20:30] <sobiwankenobi> thank you for the suggestion, vbox says the keyboard is captured, judging by the icon on the bottom right, but when i run the live session of xubuntu from the iso i cannot use the keyboard either so clearly there is a disconnect somewhere
[20:30] <Cheri703> hmm...at the top right do you have the accessibility icon? like a blue circle with a  white guy in it?
[20:31] <Cheri703> might be able to turn on the on-screen keyboard to get through the setup then troubleshoot from there?
[20:31] <sobiwankenobi> that would be great
[20:31] <sobiwankenobi> its not on the top but perhaps i can find it in the launcher
=== hns_ is now known as Guest17345
[20:31] <Cheri703> ah, yeah, if it's live booted first
[20:32] <Cheri703> it'd be accessories > onboard
[20:32] <Guest17345> how do I access xubuntu documentation?
[20:32] <Cheri703> if it's laid out how it is once installed
[20:32] <Cheri703> or under "accessibility" if you have that
[20:32] <Cheri703> but the keyboard is called "onboard"
[20:32] <sobiwankenobi> ok great thanks a lot cheri
[20:32] <Cheri703> sure!
[20:34] <sobiwankenobi> you are a hero, the onscreen keyboard works hopefully i can fix the real problem once xubuntu is fully installed
[20:34] <Cheri703> \o/
[20:34] <Cheri703> good luck!
[20:35] <Guest17345> how do I add a directory to my PATH?
[20:35] <Guest17345> i'm reading alot of contradictary information on internet when it comes to xubuntz
[20:36] <Guest17345> some places it says add to .profile
[20:36] <Guest17345> on others it says at to bashrc
[20:36] <Unit193> You can add PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin  to .bashrc for example, or just export it.
[20:36] <the_guy> cheri703, one other question any idea how to get me screen brightness adjustment back on an aspire one acer netbook?
[20:37] <the_guy> my*
[20:37] <Cheri703> that one is out of my league :) I just switched to xubuntu from vanilla ubuntu on thursday. Some stuff I can help with, others not quite. ;)
[20:37] <well_laid_lawn> Guest17345:  what does   echo $SHELL   return in a terminal ?
[20:38] <the_guy> okay.
[20:38] <Guest17345> well_laid_lawn, bin/bash
[20:38] <well_laid_lawn> Guest17345:  I'd use .bash_profile then
[20:39] <Guest17345> well_laid_lawn, where can i find the file?
[20:39] <Guest17345> well_laid_lawn, Is the syntax PATH=$PATH:(directory)?
[20:39] <well_laid_lawn> Guest17345:  if it's not in /home/you then you can make it yourself
[20:40] <well_laid_lawn> Guest17345:  I use   [[ -d ~/.bin ]]     && PATH=~/.bin:"${PATH}"
[20:42] <Guest17345> well_laid_lawn, thanks you wouldn't know any book or page that would teach me how to understand this exacly because i'm very unfamiliar with the bash environment etc?
[20:43] <Guest17345> well_laid_lawn, the code you gave me is shell script right, would that be a good place to start actually learn shellscript?
[20:43] <Guest17345> or if anyone else has some answer sorry well_laid_lawn don't want to jump all over you with questions
[20:45] <well_laid_lawn> Guest17345: see if this gets you started -  http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/start
[20:45] <Guest17345> thanks man
[20:45] <well_laid_lawn> a shell script is just a file with terminal commands in it that is made executable

[20:52] <Guest17345> i'm sorry i'm just completly unfamiliar with these commands and I hate writing something without understanding a minimum about it
[20:53] <well_laid_lawn> Guest17345:  sure. something like   [[ -d /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux ]] && PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux:"${PATH}"
[20:53] <well_laid_lawn> you'll have to logout and back in to check if edits to .bash_profile are working

=== Noskcaj is now known as Noskcaj_AFK
[21:10] <chrisc___> How do I mount an nfs directory to a directory /logs if there are active processes writing data to the directory? Would I need to init to a different level or maybe kill the processes, rename the folder to save current data, then mount the nfs to /logs, then restart? Would this work?
[21:19] <TheSheep> chrisc___: no need for that
[21:19] <TheSheep> chrisc___: the processes that have open handle for files in the underlying directory will just still have those handles open
[21:20] <TheSheep> chrisc___: and will write to those files as if nothing happend
[21:20] <TheSheep> chrisc___: and the when they try to open new files, they will open the ones from the mounted directory
[21:21] <TheSheep> chrisc___: usually you can send them the USR1 signal to make them close their log files and reopen them without terminating them
[21:21] <TheSheep> (depends on the program though)
[21:21] <chrisc___> I used logs as an example. In fact the proceses are bro, elsa, tcpdump, and some others.
[21:22] <TheSheep> well, as long as they not close and repone the files, they will just have the old files open
[21:22] <TheSheep> reopen*
[21:23] <chrisc___> I still don't follow. The FAQ of the application says that logs are stored in /nsm and that two ways to store on a different mount point are to 1) mount a separate drive to /nsm or 2) make /nsm a symlink to the new logging location.
[21:24] <chrisc___> Method 2 in the FAQ says that to avoid AppArmor issues there needs to be mods madein the usr.sbin.mysqld & tcpdump files copying the nsm line. But I can't find the nsm line in the files. So...
[21:24] <chrisc___> How do I perform method 1?
[21:24] <TheSheep> I have no idea about apparmor
[21:24] <TheSheep> never needed to mess with it
[21:24] <chrisc___> neither do i ;)
[21:25] <TheSheep> !apparmor
[21:25] <ubottu> For information about the AppArmor security framework employed in Ubuntu (since Gutsy Gibbon), see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor
[21:25] <TheSheep> perhaps that will have any helpful information :(
[21:25] <chrisc___> But I've done nfs mounts before but never to directory that is actively being used.
[21:26] <TheSheep> chrisc___: it doesn't matter, it just works
[21:26] <TheSheep> chrisc___: like, it covers up that directory, but anything that had anything open there still keeps it
[21:26] <chrisc___> Ok. going at it now
[21:32] <sobiwankenobi> all i have to say is virtualbox is very sketchy software
[21:35] <torax> how so ?
[21:42] <sobiwankenobi> i have just had a lot of difficulty installing xubuntu in it
[21:48] <torax> sobiwankenobi: I have never had any problems installing anything in virtualbox
[21:52] <sobiwankenobi> idk what the problem is, but the keyboard stopped working mid install
[21:53] <knome> got to agree with torax, i've installed xubuntu times and times in vbox, and haven't had any problems
[21:53] <sobiwankenobi> maybe i just need to try it again
[21:54] <sobiwankenobi> when you guys created the vm the first time did you choose "ubuntu" as the operating system?
[21:55] <Cheri703> sobiwankenobi: what is the host OS?
[21:55] <Cheri703> I prefer VMware player whenever I can use it
[21:56] <Cheri703> also are you using the virtualbox that is completely free or the one you download from the virtualbox site?
[21:56] <Cheri703> that can make a difference
[21:57] <knome> Cheri703, only with usb and 3d support
[21:57] <knome> Cheri703, usb should work anyway, not just high-speed - that isn't the reason why keyboard is not working
[21:59] <Cheri703> I always had a variety of issues with vbox when I used the completely free version. Not just usb and 3d support. Just a variety of things that were glitchy. I still avoid vbox as much as possible, but I have to use it for work sometimes. On my home machines I opt for VMware Player instead. The ONLY issue I've had with it was when the linux kernel updated and I had to patch VMware Player. Beyond that it has been basically seamless use for a few
[21:59] <Cheri703> years now.
[22:00] <sobiwankenobi> host os is windows 7
[22:00] <knome> Cheri703, have you installed the guest additions?
[22:00] <Cheri703> yeah, I'd say try VMware player (it doesn't exist for mac, that's why I asked)
[22:01] <sobiwankenobi> is VMware player free?
[22:01] <Cheri703> knome: yes, I tried literally everything I could and it still had issues. solving my problems from a long time ago isn't the topic at hand, getting sobiwankenobi a working Xubuntu VM is :)
[22:01] <Cheri703> yeah
[22:01] <Cheri703> yeah it's free
[22:01] <sobiwankenobi> ok
[22:01] <sobiwankenobi> i will try that out
[22:01] <sobiwankenobi> thanks guys
[22:12] <sobiwankenobi> so far the installation process with vmware player is much smoother
[22:12] <Cheri703> \o/

[22:23] <Guest15981> it says Error: Writetodisk: Access
[22:23] <Guest15981> in the uTorrent client
[22:24] <torax> Guest15981: please note there are other good torrent clients that are not adware.
[22:24] <torax> transmission for example
[22:24] <esph> transmission is very nice
[22:24] <Guest15981> ok so this will work better than uTorrent?
[22:25] <esph> works on all the major platorms (I think), too
[22:25] <torax> well, id say anything works better than software that installs ads without asking me
[22:25] <esph> platforms*
[22:25] <Guest15981> is it the client that I am using or did I download it wrong?  I saved the client to the flash drive, should I have saved the client to the PC?

[22:29] <esph> (I'm in the process of installing, btw. just got to the partitioning part)
[22:33] <torax> hmm, maybe use the 24 GB as / and the regular hdd as /home
[22:34] <torax> if 24GB is enough as / for you
[22:37] <knome> ssd should really be used as /
[22:37] <knome> that way you'll benefit the most out of it
[22:37] <esph> torax: this was my original thought, but I've also seen discussion about using it as a cache (which is how windows would use it)
[22:38] <knome> esph, how much ram do you have?
[22:38] <esph> 8GB
[22:38] <knome> do you think you'll ever need that?
[22:38] <knome> i mean, are you going to do operations that constantly require max. possible (over 8GB)
[22:39] <esph> knome: I mean like the kind of "smart cache" that windows would do with this SSD (there are linux utilities that offer similar functionality)
[22:39] <esph> putting some frequently used programs and data there, or whatever
[22:40] <knome> i believe if you mount the SSD as / and the HDD as /home, the smart cache utilities will use the SSD anyway
[22:41] <esph> They would have less freedom over what to put there in that case, though, since I've taken up at least half of the space by doing that
[22:41] <Cheri703> sobiwankenobi: awesome!
[22:41] <Cheri703> Glad to hear it :)
[22:42] <esph> but if you think putting root there is easily the best use, then I'll go for that
[22:42] <knome> that will speed up booting and running applications a lot
[22:42] <esph> right
[22:42] <knome> i'd definitely do that at least :)
[22:47] <entreri> hey there, I'm trying to install Chromium from Ubuntu Software Center, but I can't press the "Install" button, it just does nothing. Any ideas why ?
[22:50] <torax> entreri: sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
[22:52] <entreri> torax: sorry but I've asked from USC...
[22:53] <entreri> I want to fix my broken Ubuntu Software Center...
[22:53] <esph> knome: do I need to use the advanced partitioning tool to accomplish this?
[22:54] <knome> esph, probably, since you have two disks
[22:54] <esph> hmm, ok
[22:54] <esph> haven't been able to find a good guide for it
[22:54] <Cheri703> entreri: whenever something is behaving oddly like that, my first step is to reboot and try it again, just to make sure something else isn't affecting things
[22:54] <knome> esph, if you have questions, feel free to ask here
[22:55] <esph> I've partitioned several drives from the command line, but I'm not really sure what I should do here
[22:55] <knome> command line?
[22:55] <esph> shell
[22:55] <esph> *
[22:55] <esph> w/e
[22:55] <entreri> Cheri703: Well I did not reboot since I updated so I should try that
[22:55] <knome> esph, there should be an advanced tool with a gui
[22:55] <knome> esph, or are you using the alternate installer?
[22:56] <esph> regular installer
[22:56] <esph> I've seen the gui partitioner
[22:57] <entreri> Cheri703: but yeah, my "Install" button is greyed
[22:58] <esph> using the utilities I've used in the past, I'd know how to make sure / and /home ended up in the right places, but I'm not sure I'll do it right using this. I'm probably worrying to much, though.
[22:58] <knome> esph, if you don't have any data to lose, then you should just try :)
[22:58] <esph> I'm also not sure if the laptop will accept /boot being on the mSATA drive or not
[22:58] <knome> why not?
[22:58] <esph> sometimes they can be silly like that
[22:59] <esph> but I guess I'll try it
[22:59] <knome> esph, good luck!
[23:00] <esph> knome: thanks
[23:02] <esph> knome: does the bootloader that comes with Xubuntu need fat32?
[23:02] <esph> also, what size is it
[23:02] <knome> no, doesn't need fat. don't know about the actual size
[23:03] <esph> So, everything can be ext4 then?
[23:03] <knome> yes
[23:03] <esph> ok, cool
[23:11] <entreri_> hello, so the install button in "Ubuntu Software Center" is greyed out, I know what is the problem but I don't know how to solve it. The problem is that I would be able to install a software from USC if I have a "working internet connection", I'm connected with Bluetooth PAN and it seems that USC thinks I'm not connected to the internet, any ideas how to fix that ?
[23:22] <GridCube> entreri, its a known bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-center/+bug/911706
[23:22] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 911706 in software-center (Ubuntu) "USC relies on NM to be online, can't force online if not using NM" [High,Confirmed]
[23:22] <GridCube> entreri, just use synaptic
[23:26] <entreri> GridCube: thanks, nice to know it's high priority
[23:28] <GridCube> but really entreri just use synaptic or plain old apt-get
