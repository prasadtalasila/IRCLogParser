[15:33] <Apex_Strider> Hey guys, I need some help please.
[15:48] <TheLordOfTime> Apex_Strider, with?
[15:48] <TheLordOfTime> (usually asking your question rather than asking for help gets you better results)
[15:50] <Apex_Strider> Sorry, I'm not exactly an Ubuntu wizz! I just have an issue with my sources.list. Can't get updates. I  read that I might be able to post my list here, and someone may be able to help.
[15:51] <TheLordOfTime> Apex_Strider, you may want #ubuntu
[15:51] <TheLordOfTime> and when you get to #Ubuntu pastebin your sources.list
[15:51] <TheLordOfTime> and give information about your release (which Ubuntu you're on, etc.)
[15:51] <Apex_Strider> Oh, okay. I'll try that. Thanks!
[15:52] <TheLordOfTime> Apex_Strider, also pastebin the error(s) you're seeing with apt-get or whatever you use to update (sudo apt-get update | pastebinit   <-- that in the terminal = awesome)
[15:52] <TheLordOfTime> (assuming you have pastebinit, which you probably don't)
[15:52] <TheLordOfTime> Apex_Strider, just /join #ubuntu   and you'll be there :)
[15:53] <Apex_Strider> Not sure about the Pastebinit
[15:53] <Apex_Strider> I'm on 12.04
[15:53] <TheLordOfTime> Apex_Strider, just go to #ubuntu and ask for help :P
[15:53] <Apex_Strider> Will do...
[15:53] <TheLordOfTime> since #launchpad isn't directly Ubuntu support :)
[15:53] <Apex_Strider> Ah, gotcha! ;-)
[16:46] <\n> hi, I need help. my launchpad username is nyuszika7h - I've forgot my password and the e-mail address I registered with doesn't exist anymore. is there any way to recover my account?
[16:51] <maxb> A @gmail.com address doesn't exist? How come?
[16:53] <maxb> \n: ^
[16:54] <TheLordOfTime> maxb, it could've been purged.
[16:54] <TheLordOfTime> google purges accounts after a while
[16:54] <TheLordOfTime> and also sometimeis kills google accounts if they've received abuse reports
[16:55]  * TheLordOfTime has had it happen twice
[16:55] <TheLordOfTime> both times they reversed it.
[16:55] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[16:55] <maxb> Huh, google's smtp server certainly says it doesn't exist.
[16:55] <TheLordOfTime> which supports the theory google removed the account
[16:55] <maxb> I guess the simplest thing to try first would be to see if you can re-register it :-)
[16:56] <TheLordOfTime> Eeeyup.
[16:56] <TheLordOfTime> ...
[16:56] <TheLordOfTime> the next time my girlfriend modifies my autocomplete to change "Yep" to 'Eeeyup'...  i swear...
[16:57] <maxb> heh :-)
[16:59] <\n> maxb: I deleted the account
[16:59] <maxb> The gmail account?
[16:59] <\n> yes
[16:59] <\n> I created a new one, and I use a google apps one as my primary now
[16:59] <TheLordOfTime> should've changed your email first.
[16:59] <TheLordOfTime> \n, at least temporarily rereg.
[16:59] <TheLordOfTime> and then delete the account when you're done, after you change your email in LP?
[16:59] <TheLordOfTime> actually about that
[16:59] <maxb> Will google allow you to re-register the old address? If so, that's definitely the quickest way to get this sorted out.
[16:59] <TheLordOfTime> maxb, good question
[16:59] <\n> I'll try
[17:00] <maxb> When changing your address, you'll need to separately change it in both Launchpad and in Ubuntu SSO
[17:00] <\n> Someone already has that username. Try another?
[17:00] <maxb> Ubuntu SSO confusingly masquerades as login.launchpad.net, but is NOT part of Launchpad
[17:00] <\n> won't let me re-register
[17:01] <maxb> \n: OK, I think you're probably stuck needing to ask for administrator intervention then
[17:01] <\n> hm
[17:01] <\n> This account was deleted 19 days ago. You can attempt to restore it by selecting one of your recovery methods below.
[17:02] <\n> Internal Error
[17:02] <\n> If you want to try again, please start the recovery process from the beginning.
[17:02] <\n> meh
[17:03] <czajkowski> \n: for SSO stuff you will need to ask for help in #canonical-isd but it's still holidays for many canonical folks till tomorrow. so you are better off filling in https://forms.canonical.com/sso-support/
[17:03] <\n> ok
[17:03] <maxb> You'll probably need to prove your identity somehow - signing something with the PGP key attached to the Launchpad account in question might be a good way to do it
[17:03] <\n> hmm
[17:04] <\n> I'm not sure did I attach the new key to it
[17:04] <\n> I seem to have two keys, one for the old address
[17:04] <\n> so probably
[17:04] <czajkowski> they'' work with you to resolve it, could be details of when you created the account, anything you did with the ac etc
[17:06] <maxb> Oh, I see that PGP key is revoked, I guess some sort of alternative method will be necessary
[17:06] <\n> it's revoked?
[17:06] <maxb> http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?search=0x7D3C68F16E9CF4F564522564B66865933B0308D8&op=index
[17:06] <\n> I thought I attached another one
[17:06] <maxb> I only see one PGP key mentioned on https://launchpad.net/~nyuszika7h
[17:07] <\n> I have an old one in my keyring here
[17:07] <\n> pub   2048R/0x5FD879696A9D469C 2011-07-29
[17:07] <\n> uid                            nyuszika7h <litemininyuszika@gmail.com>
[17:07] <\n> sub   2048R/0xBB0A2566C6FC64DA 2011-07-29
[17:07] <\n> I also have the revoked key, not sure if that helps
[17:07] <maxb> I think you'll have to file a request and see what SSO Support suggest.
[17:08] <maxb> Launchpad accounts can be merged, so you might like to just create a new one for now.
[17:10] <\n> I'll use "icecreamsandwich" as the ID for the new account, for now :3
[21:16] <exarkun> Hello.  I wonder how to change the "reply to" settings of a mailing list hosted on Launchpad.
[21:19] <lifeless> exarkun: There is no facility to do so.
[21:19] <lifeless> exarkun: if you're talking about the munge-reply-to antifeature of mailman
[21:20] <exarkun> Can I ask a Launchpad admin to do it?
[21:20] <lifeless> No
[21:20] <exarkun> :(
[21:20] <lifeless> its not that its privileged
[21:20] <lifeless> its that there is no facility to do it at all
[21:21] <lifeless> LP generates the settings
[21:21] <lifeless> and sets that to the non-munging setting
[21:23] <lifeless> exarkun: so you'd need a patch, which would need some justification [is it worth carrying the complexity [in terms of support cost, both end user and code maintenance]]
[21:24] <exarkun> How do I quantify "worth"?
[21:25] <exarkun> If I said "I absolutely hate the current mailing list setting", is that a justification?
[21:25] <exarkun> (I would suppose not)
[21:25] <lifeless> its certainly first hand data
[21:25] <lifeless> but it doesn't tell LP devs much about what ratio of users also hate it
[21:26] <lifeless> exarkun: Out of interest, why do you hate it ?
[21:26] <exarkun> I don't know anything about that ratio, so I can't tell them anything about it.
[21:27] <exarkun> I'm subscribed to the mailing list.  The mailing list software can deliver messages to me.  I don't need to get duplicate copies from other people who are replying to things.  I can change settings about messages delivered from the mailing list (like enable digest delivery, disable delivery entirely, etc); I have no such control over messages sent directly from other posters to me.
