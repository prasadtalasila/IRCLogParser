[05:57] <Kilos> you fell asleep fone in hand last night hey?
[05:57] <Kilos> ah
[05:57] <Kilos> haha
[05:57] <Kilos> your quassel still showed you online
[05:57] <magespawn> it does not give me a lot of warning
[05:57] <magespawn> yup
[05:58] <Kilos> you need to do like fly and let it show away somehow
[06:06] <magespawn> i usually do, that is done by using the "/away" command, but did not have time when the battery went flat
[06:06] <Kilos> oh sorry magespawn thought it was an auto thing
[06:07] <magespawn> i do not know of a way that will do it automatically after a certain period
[06:08] <Kilos> not serious
[06:09] <Kilos> all good there? lotsa rain coming
[06:09] <Kilos> jozini dam will fill up
[06:09] <Kilos> hopefully
[06:14] <magespawn> the dam is almost full anyway
[06:14] <Kilos> wow you guys are lucky
[06:15] <Kilos> i was there when they built it and it wa just a tiny stream running in
[06:15] <magespawn> somebody let out 15% when they should have let out 1.5%
[06:15] <magespawn> there is almost always a lot of water there
[06:15] <Kilos> did the telx upkeep at the military base at the top
[06:16] <magespawn> cool
[06:16] <Kilos> telex
[06:16] <magespawn> must have looked very different
[06:16] <Kilos> looked like it would never fill up. such a small stream and such a big dam
[06:17] <magespawn> i have never seen it even close to empty in the 10 years or so i have been here
[06:18] <Kilos> wow some of the inland dams have gone down to 15% in the last few years
[06:19] <magespawn> the hluhluwe dam was getting very low, not sure what %, small dam with lots of usage, but that is full again

[07:47] <inetpro> Vince-0: wb
[07:47] <inetpro> Kilos: your ups now completely dead again?
[07:48] <Kilos> i disconnected the internal battery inetpro but i think the wires to the external are too thin so can carry the juice to keep it going
[07:49] <Kilos> so i got it one side for further pondering
[07:49] <Vince-0> thnkz, busy editing discussion notes from last nights hangout - 2hours 21 minutes!
[07:49] <Vince-0> posted the youtube video now
[07:49] <Kilos> whew
[07:53] <Vince-0> ya it was a bit long, we aim to make it more concise and professional
[08:05] <jrgns> is anyone playing ingress?
[08:07] <Vince-0> yar
[08:07] <Vince-0> its a bit slow in Durban
[08:09] <jrgns> yeah, i'm struggling to find portals around here as well.
[08:10] <Vince-0> you can submit portals
[08:10] <Vince-0> and check the ingress intel map site
[08:11] <jrgns> submitted one on my way to work
[08:11] <jrgns> but it takes up to 3 weeks to approve :(
[08:11] <jrgns> will submit a few, though, hopefully they get added
[08:17] <Vince-0> should do, there are some silly ones approved in Durban
[08:25] <jrgns> hehe, kewl

[08:55] <Vince-0> I dunno, its not that much fun - just a novelty 
[08:57] <magespawn> not much info on the website

[14:28] <Kilos> magespawn, you got 5 mins?
[14:29] <Kilos> if i want to copy files to server from which terminal must i do it
[14:29] <Kilos> this one or the servers one
[14:30] <Kilos> or must it be done without first sshing
[14:32] <Kilos> im looking here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/TransferFiles
[14:33] <Kilos> they say to transfer with ssh and use scp but dont say first ssh or not
[14:34] <Kilos> now the pro will say read or man
[14:34] <Kilos> ai!
[14:36] <inetpro> ai!
[14:37] <inetpro> Kilos: where do you want to copy files?
[14:37] <inetpro> name the source and destination folders
[14:38] <Kilos> i wanna copy archives from here to server inetpro 
[14:38] <inetpro> folders!
[14:39] <inetpro> name the source and destination folders
[14:39] <Kilos> ya but must i first ssh to the server then run the command
[14:39] <inetpro> no
[14:39] <Kilos> and in which terminal then
[14:39] <inetpro> ai!
[14:39] <Kilos> lol
[14:39] <inetpro> Kilos: let's just take it step by step
[14:39] <inetpro> let's step back for now
[14:39] <Kilos> ok so they can ping eat other
[14:40] <inetpro> you want to copy from machine BOB to ANN
[14:40] <inetpro> but on BOB what is the folder name?
[14:40] <Kilos> so i just go scp /var/cache/apt/archives/ miles@192.168.1.2 /var/cache/apt/archives/
[14:41] <inetpro> ahh, you see!
[14:41] <inetpro> that's exactly why I'm asking
[14:41] <Kilos> what?
[14:41] <inetpro> those folders are owned by root
[14:41] <Kilos> ya well i type slow
[14:41] <Kilos> ok so sudo to start here and what at the server side
[14:42] <inetpro> nee
[14:42] <Kilos> ai!
[14:42] <inetpro> 1. by default those files are readable by you (as the user)
[14:42] <inetpro> 2. but the destination is owned by root
[14:43] <inetpro> you can not write to root owned folders
[14:43] <inetpro> so you will have to copy to a temporary folder owned by you
[14:43] <Kilos> like home?
[14:43] <Kilos> no desktop there
[14:43] <inetpro> yebo yes
[14:43] <inetpro> so?!
[14:43] <Kilos> oh temp
[14:44] <inetpro> well temp will/should also work
[14:44] <inetpro> maybe
[14:44] <inetpro> hang on
[14:44] <Kilos> you busy man sort work first
[14:44] <inetpro> ai!
[14:46] <Vince-0> hey hey - sup Kilos , was busy workin yawn
[14:46] <Vince-0> u playing games?
[14:46] <inetpro> Kilos: on BOB type the following:
[14:46] <inetpro> rsync -av /var/cache/apt/archives/ ANN:/tmp/myarchives/
[14:46] <Vince-0> nlsthzn, what games you playing?
[14:46] <Kilos> nope Vince-0 not me we need gamers to take on the mexicans
[14:47] <inetpro> Kilos: then on BOB, after you've logged in with ssh
[14:47] <Vince-0> ha, Linux games I'm guessing
[14:47] <Kilos> http://viajemotu.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/ubuntu-loco-games-2013-1/
[14:47] <inetpro> Kilos: cp -r /tmp/myarchives/* /var/cache/apt/archives/
[14:48] <inetpro> Kilos: oops I mean
[14:48] <Kilos> ok ty inetpro and thats without first sshing?
[14:48] <inetpro> Kilos: then on ANN, after you've logged in with ssh
[14:48] <Kilos> oh my
[14:48] <Vince-0> Kilos, first person shooters are my speciality
[14:49] <Vince-0> but I wonder what the latency would be like to play against Mexico
[14:49] <Kilos> nlsthzn, here is Vince-0 
[14:49] <Kilos> will only find out after trying
[14:50] <inetpro> Kilos: but you could also use scp in stead of rsync... obviously with other parameters 
[14:51] <Kilos> well if rsync will work that great
[14:51] <Kilos> i like rsync
[14:52] <inetpro> if you can login as root on your remote server then you can sync directly from folder to folder
[14:52] <inetpro> but allowing root to login is not very good
[14:53] <Kilos> i think i can once sshed to there
[14:53] <Vince-0> I will make a note of these loco games and post them to the LUG - need to leave now bbl
[14:53] <inetpro> drussell: wb
[14:53] <Kilos> bob is the boss pc here right

[14:58] <inetpro> Kilos: oops, my fout

[17:18] <Kilos> oh my
[17:18] <Cantide> oh oh
[17:18] <Cantide> i kinda do see them while i am at work
[17:18] <Cantide> and i was partially aware of what was going on
[17:18] <Cantide> my PC is not game-friendly right now
[17:18] <Cantide> no gfx card
[17:18] <Cantide> so i didn't read into the emails much
[17:18] <Kilos> aw
[17:19] <Kilos> we dont seem to have anyone to take up the challenge
[17:19] <Kilos> will have to be tumbleweed and superfly 
[17:20] <Cantide> superweed '<
[17:20] <Cantide> tumblefly
[17:20] <Kilos> hehe
[17:20] <Cantide> they work well together, it seems
[17:20] <Kilos> they our python kings
[17:21] <Cantide> :)
[17:25] <mazal> Evening all
[17:25] <Kilos> hiya mazal you been scarce
[17:25] <mazal> Rough day oom
[17:25] <Kilos> ai
[17:26] <Kilos> and barry too
[17:26] <Kilos> what happened
[17:26] <mazal> Been in the field battling viruses and user shifting all day
[17:26] <mazal> Barry was off today
[17:26] <Kilos> virii on winsucks
[17:26] <mazal> yep
[17:26] <Kilos> ai they never learn
[17:27] <mazal> Biggest problem is we don't have proper av
[17:27] <Kilos> monday night meeting here hey
[17:27] <Kilos> get avast
[17:27] <mazal> Well I should say our employer
[17:27] <Kilos> best anti for win
[17:27] <mazal> They force what we must use
[17:28] <Kilos> eish
[17:28] <Cantide> Kilos, what time? 19:30 again?
[17:28] <Kilos> avg?
[17:28] <mazal> One of the reasons why we build our own ubuntu server to get updates distributed
[17:28] <Kilos> yip Cantide 
[17:28] <Cantide> cool :)
[17:28] <Cantide> i should make that
[17:28] <Kilos> cancell everything else
[17:29] <mazal> They use Mcafee , which never updates
[17:29] <mazal> So we installed mse and distribute updates via our own server
[17:29] <Kilos> thats no good one needs daily updates
[17:29] <Kilos> mse?
[17:29] <mazal> Yep
[17:29] <mazal> Microsoft security essentials
[17:29] <Kilos> eeeekkk
[17:30] <Kilos> thats worse
[17:30] <Cantide> mse is nice 'o'
[17:30] <mazal> Works sharp for us
[17:30] <Cantide> it's the best one, imho
[17:30] <mazal> Best I've used actually
[17:30] <Cantide> i used it briefly before dropping windows in the recycle bin
[17:30] <mazal> lol
[17:30] <mazal> Oh I wish hey
[17:31] <Kilos> just that first word raises the hair on my arms
[17:31] <mazal> I don't believe I am saying it , but that is one little program where they did good actually
[17:31] <Kilos> haha
[17:32] <Kilos> they have their uses
[17:32] <mazal> The rest was just reshuffling and that brings lots of work
[17:32] <Kilos> i use 98 for fdisking drives and fixing mbr's
[17:32] <mazal> Amazing the amount of little things that needs to be configured for every user :P
[17:33] <mazal> Was very late when I actually got to the office
[17:34] <Kilos> thats life if you dont inherit millions
[17:36] <mazal> Meeting hey , must remember
[17:37] <mazal> Feels like ages since we had the last one
[17:37] <Kilos> yeah a whole month
[17:39] <mazal> Ek gaan bietjie rugby kyk
[17:39] <Kilos> wie speel
[17:39] <mazal> Nee is ou games wat ek op dvd het
[17:39] <mazal> Ek collect mos finals
[17:39] <Kilos> ah ok geniet
[17:39] <Cantide> one game i want to watch again is England vs NZ at the end of last year :)
[17:40] <Cantide> was one of the best games i've seen in a long time
[17:40] <Cantide> also, does anyone here support the EP / Souther Kings?
[17:40] <Cantide> Southern &
[17:40] <mazal> Nope
[17:40] <Kilos> me supports the sharks
[17:40] <mazal> I'm a bulls supporter
[17:41] <Cantide> I support the sharks
[17:41] <Cantide> and anyone who plays against the Kings :p
[17:41] <Kilos> lol
[17:41] <Cantide> because it's not fair how they got into Super Rugby - they need to earn their place like everyone else
[17:41] <mazal> I don't like the way the kings is getting "special treatment" and how the lions was treated
[17:41] <Cantide> exactly my point
[17:41] <mazal> snap
[17:41] <Cantide> :p
[17:42] <Cantide> once they have earned that, i will hold nothing against them
[17:42] <Kilos> lol
[17:42] <Cantide> for the time being, i will enjoy watching them lose :)
[17:42] <Cantide> brb, thirsty as a camel 'o'
[17:42] <mazal> They gonna get killed in S15
[17:42] <mazal> You can't put a team in there that don't even qualify for curry cup

[18:52] <inetpro> smile: goeienaand
[18:52] <smile> goeienaand :)
[18:52] <inetpro> jy was skaars hierdie week?
[18:52] <smile> ja :(
[18:52] <inetpro> wat's fout?
[18:52] <smile> ek het gewerk vir my gip projek :)
[18:52] <smile> geintegreerde proef
[18:52] <smile> :p
[18:53] <smile> ek het 'n chat client voorgestel :)
[18:53] <inetpro> ok
[18:53] <inetpro> klink interessant
[18:53] <smile> en daar moest nog 'n cursus gemaak word :)
[18:53] <smile> (hoe dit na te maak)
[18:53] <smile> :p
[18:55] <inetpro> smile: waarvoor is dit?
[18:55] <inetpro> by die skool?
[18:56] <inetpro> of wikipedia?
[18:56] <smile> vir die skool :p
[18:57] <inetpro> ahh
[18:59] <smile> now I only need to create a website for the chat client :)
[19:00] <smile> and after that publish the client (maybe server too) online :p
[19:00] <smile> and then I'll get good points
[19:00] <smile> :)
[19:01] <inetpro> sounds like you deserve some good points
[19:01] <inetpro> smile: so what chat cient would this be?
[19:01] <inetpro> client?
[19:01] <inetpro> client*
[19:01] <inetpro> ai!
[19:01] <smile> lol :P
[19:01] <inetpro> irc?
[19:02] <inetpro> or mobile?
[19:02] <inetpro> jabber?
[19:02] <smile> no no :p
[19:02] <smile> proprietairy :)
[19:02] <inetpro> hmm...
[19:02] <smile> with commands like LIST, SEND
[19:02] <smile> :)
[19:02] <inetpro> why?
[19:02] <inetpro> just proove of concept?
[19:02] <smile> yeah
[19:03] <smile> not for daily use actually :p
[19:03] <inetpro> or for real life usage
[19:03] <inetpro> ahh
[19:03] <inetpro> smile: so did they prescribe what technology to use?
[19:05] <smile> yeah :p
[19:05] <smile> we had to use VB.Net
[19:05] <smile> so no, it doesn't run on Linux
[19:05] <smile> :(
[19:07] <smile> Maybe on Wine :DD
[19:07] <smile> I tried to compile wine, and it succeeded
[19:07] <smile> but somehow my old wine version isn't gone :(
[19:11] <inetpro> ok
[19:11] <inetpro> so I guess your teachers don't know about Linux yet?
[19:19] <smile> inetpro: they do :p
[19:20] <smile> but you need Windows to follow the course
[19:20] <smile> :p
[19:20] <inetpro> that's sad
[19:21] <Vince-0> back! 
[19:21] <Vince-0> thanks for the compliments - the LUG here needs some activity so with G+ its easier
[19:24] <inetpro> Vince-0: G+ really makes life easier these days
[19:24] <inetpro> sadly there are still a lot of people not yet on G+
[19:24] <Vince-0> yeah, requires some bandwidth
[19:25] <Squirm> tired
[19:31] <smile> byee :)
[19:32] <smile> inetpro: indeed it is :p
[19:32] <inetpro> Vince-0: not only that
[19:33] <inetpro> some people are still very sceptical of Google
[19:33] <inetpro> with reason
[19:33] <Vince-0> as opposed to facebook? with privacy?
[19:33] <inetpro> you can't always trust these big corporates
[19:33] <inetpro> oh don't even go there
[19:33] <smile> good night! :)
[19:33] <inetpro> goeie nag smile
[19:33] <Vince-0> meh, I have nothing to hide - their free services are worth my privacy
[19:34] <smile> dankie, inetpro :)
[19:34] <inetpro> no honestly, a lot of businesses are even blocking all mail coming from google
[19:34] <Vince-0> ya?
[19:34] <inetpro> well maybe not a lot, but some
[19:37] <inetpro> it's a reality that we still need to recognize
[19:37] <inetpro> and then there are the many multiples of people who believe that facebook is the internet
[19:39] <Vince-0> i deleted my account 
[19:39] <Vince-0> can't log in - so thats a good sign
[19:39] <inetpro> still amazes me how computer illiterate people can suddenly use a computer 
[19:40] <inetpro> thing is, you will never get these people to join on G+
[19:40] <Vince-0> ha
[19:40] <inetpro> but it doesn't really bother me
[19:42] <inetpro> I use both, but I have scaled down on using facebook 
[19:42] <inetpro> basically just have my g+ set to go to twitter and then to fb
[19:46] <Vince-0> aah
[19:51] <inetpro> I don''t know why but I still think that the g+ communities are not yet fully utilised
[19:53] <Vince-0> they're not
[19:53] <Vince-0> I have difficulty using more than one account, like my personal one and the one for the LUG
[19:53] <inetpro> difficulty?
[19:53] <Vince-0> although the LUG "page" has the ability for me to be a moderator
[19:54] <inetpro> I like theb way they did it
[19:54] <inetpro> the way*
[19:54] <Vince-0> I can switch to the LUG community page as a moderator but the scheduled hangout isn't live so I had to recreate the hangout as myself
[19:54] <inetpro> hmm...
[19:55] <inetpro> ok
[19:55] <inetpro> I guess I shall also have to play with that at some point
[19:56]  * inetpro was amazed with the amount of people who joined the ubuntu-za community last night
[19:57] <inetpro> Vince-0: I think you even joined while you were still in the hangout
[19:57] <Vince-0> that was the other guy
[19:58] <inetpro> so I do think it's a very effective tool for communication without being in your face
[19:58] <inetpro> Vince-0: the other guy?
[19:58] <Vince-0> u can switch off video/voice
[19:59] <Vince-0> the other participant dropped off and rejoined with two windows
[19:59] <inetpro> Vince-0: no what I'm saying is that I think you where still in your hangout meeting when I created the G+ ubuntu-za community
[20:00] <inetpro> and then you joined almost immediately
[20:00] <Vince-0> oh yeah
[20:00] <inetpro> you couldn't see that it was me who created it because I used the ubuntu-za profile
[20:01] <Vince-0> ubuntu-za@gmail.com its own log in account or as a moderator for the account?
[20:02] <inetpro> no, just moderator 
[20:02] <inetpro> I actually didn't create that email account
