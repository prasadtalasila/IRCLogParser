[08:31] <bazhang> hi
[08:31] <Emanon> Hello.
[08:31] <bazhang> whats the problem
[08:32] <Emanon> There is a nick that keeps popping up in #ubuntu and saying "ciao" followed by "!list" then leaving.
[08:32] <Emanon> Actually there have been multiple nicks doing the exact same thing the last few days.
[08:32] <bazhang> he/she is gone
[08:32] <IdleOne> Emanon: that user has quit IRC. Also, dax from #freenode asked me to give you this link https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/14635
[08:32] <bazhang> s/days/years/
[08:33] <Emanon> Is there any chance someone could make a bot to auto kickban anyone who joins, says "ciao" followed by "!list" within a short period of time?
[08:33] <bazhang> not really no
[08:33] <Emanon> Alright, well thank you anyways. Have a nice day.

[19:00] <cub> y i get kicked
[19:01] <ikonia> "why does linux suck" - really ? is that how you expect to interact with people in an ubuntu support channel ?
[19:02] <cub> well it doesnt work my display is messed up
[19:02] <ikonia> ok, so normal people would explain what they are trying to do, the problem they are having and request help
[19:02] <ikonia> you just joined and stated "why does linux suck"
[19:03] <cub> cuz im mad
[19:03] <ikonia> can you see how the two are totally different ?
[19:03] <ikonia> so ?
[19:03] <ikonia> the 1400 people in the channel don't deserve deal with that just because you are mad
[19:03] <cub> ok
[19:03] <cub> sorry
[19:04] <ikonia> if you can't communicate clearly because you are mad, then come back when you are not mad
[19:04] <ikonia> ok, so if you /part this channel, and rejoin /join #ubuntu and try to explain your need for help again, I'm sure it will be a better situation this time
[19:05] <cub> ok
