[07:49] <rogpeppe> davecheney: ping
[07:49] <rogpeppe> mornin' all!
[08:19] <rogpeppe> wallyworld_: you around?
[10:18] <aram> hello.
[10:31] <rogpeppe> aram, dimitern: hiya
[10:32] <dimitern> rogpeppe, aram: morning :)
[10:32] <rogpeppe> dimitern: openstack tests are broken in trunk BTW, if you don't have OS_TENANT_NAME set
[10:32] <dimitern> rogpeppe: hmm
[10:32] <dimitern> rogpeppe: that's now or the branch I proposed yesterday?
[10:33] <rogpeppe> dimitern: currently
[10:34] <rogpeppe> dimitern: it would also be nice if the goose "required environment variable" error message printed the name of the required environment variable rather than the struct field name...
[10:34] <rogpeppe> "required environment variable not set for credentials attribute: TenantName" makes it look as if the required env var is $TenantName
[10:35] <dimitern> rogpeppe: tell me about it :) I did it like that originally, but.. anyway I'll take a look
[10:51] <dimitern> rogpeppe: fixed https://codereview.appspot.com/7196043 - this is trivial, if you think it's ok, I'll land it now
[10:51] <jam> mgz: poke
[10:52] <rogpeppe> dimitern: LGTM. agreed trivial.
[10:52] <dimitern> rogpeppe: 10x, submitting then
[10:55] <dimitern> rogpeppe: how about looking at my bootstrap branch - https://codereview.appspot.com/7181046/
[10:55] <rogpeppe> dimitern: will do
[10:56] <mgz> jam: hey
[10:56] <jam> mgz: I had some questions about how to setup tarmac, and thought you might be good to bounce off for feedback.
[10:56] <jam> I think I have it up and running, and a small patch to handle some stuff I didn't realize.
[10:56] <jam> However, what branch do we want it to actually manage?
[10:57] <jam> (do we want to add it to ~gophers, and give it write access there, do we want a different team, a branch only accessble by goose-bot, ... ?)
[10:59] <jam> (I guess the next direct step is to add support for running juju-core tests before landing trunk code, but I'd like to answer the above first)
[10:59] <mgz> hm, the bzr-pqm way is to have the branch owned by the bot
[10:59] <jam> mgz: right
[10:59] <jam> the major downside is the "manual escape hatch"
[10:59] <mgz> but being able to get around it and commit anyway will probably be useful for now
[10:59] <jam> especially because of wanting to be able to land goose code and juju-core code concurrently
[11:00] <mgz> yup.
[11:01] <mgz> so, maybe we want a new team that the bot can be a member of to own the goose code
[11:04] <jam> I tend to be cautious, so giving it full '~gophers' access seemed a bit much, but it is also a fair amount of bookkeeping just to do goose.
[11:04] <mgz> yeah.
[11:05] <dimitern> jam: but isn't that like the other go projects? all owned by ~gophers?
[11:07] <jam> dimitern: sure, and all of us have the ability to push whatever we want to them. I'm hesitant to allow a bot the same access.
[11:08] <mgz> it's easy enough to make ~gophers a member of the group that owns goose trunk, we just don't want the bot to have too much power :)
[11:08] <jam> dimitern: it also stems from a group that doesn't have a habit of using a bot to control their trunks, vs the launchpad group using that method for a long time.
[11:08] <dimitern> jam: wouldn't it need to merge and push changes?
[11:08] <jam> dimitern: goose bot needs to be able to write to goose's trunk
[11:08] <jam> I'm not sure that it needs rights to everything else owned by ~gophers
[11:08] <jam> (juju-core, goamz, etc, etc.)
[11:09] <dimitern> you don't trust the bot? c'mon :D
[11:09] <dimitern> it's a nice guy
[11:09] <jam> dimitern: the inverse is actually just as important (to me). I would rather the equivalent of having to run 'sudo' to be able to alter trunk.
[11:10] <jam> so that: yes anyone on our team can fix trunk if we need to, but we have to do so very explicitly instead of accidentally
[11:10] <dimitern> jam, makes sense - preventing accidental mistakes, provided it doesn't impede normal workflow
[11:12] <rogpeppe> dimitern: reviewed
[11:12] <jam> so mostly I'm trying to find the tasteful point in balancing these desires, adding goose-bot to ~gophers is the most expedient solution, though not one I personally control.
[11:12] <jam> as is having the branch owned explicitly by goose-bot
[11:13] <jam> I suppose goose-bot the launchpad account could just have us all know the password, and all have our ssh-keys attached to the account.
[11:13] <jam> mgz: ^^?
[11:13] <jam> that would give us "do X to become the goose-bot superuser"
[11:13] <dimitern> rogpeppe: tyvm
[11:14] <jam> mgz: ah, but the problem ends up that only goose-bot can approve changes to ~goose-bot/ branches. I'll have to look into the review side of things to figure out how to fix that
[11:14] <mgz> that would probably be okay
[11:15] <jam> mgz: looks like you can set a "reviewers" on a branch
[11:15] <jam> which I can just make ~gophers
[11:15] <mgz> yeah
[11:15] <jam> so they can approve branches even though they can't commit directly to it.
[11:35] <mgz> jam: poke?
[11:35] <wallyworld_> rogpeppe: i am around now, am in a stand up
[11:35] <rogpeppe> wallyworld_: np, the issue's been fixed now.
[11:36] <wallyworld_> ok, sorry i was at soccer training
[11:58] <rogpeppe> wallyworld_: i only pinged you 'cos you were the only one that showed up on the IRC user list :-)
[11:58] <wallyworld_> ah ok
[11:58] <wallyworld_> i didn't log out at my EOD
[11:59] <rogpeppe> a couple of CLs if anyone wants. the first one is pretty trivial, the second a bit bigger: https://codereview.appspot.com/7197043/ https://codereview.appspot.com/7133063/
[11:59] <dimitern> rogpeppe: I'm on the first one
[11:59] <rogpeppe> dimitern: thanks
=== jtv1 is now known as jtv
[12:04] <dimitern> rogpeppe: reviewed
[12:04] <rogpeppe> dimitern: thanks
[12:04] <rogpeppe> anyone else wanna take it to the magic two LGTMs? :-) https://codereview.appspot.com/7197043/
[12:05] <dimitern> rogpeppe: it's weird though, unlike the usual case the first comment wasn't "Please take a look" from you
[12:06] <rogpeppe> dimitern: ha, i'd forgotten to lbox propose it without -wip
[12:07] <rogpeppe> dimitern: it's got that message now :-)
[12:07] <dimitern> rogpeppe: ok :)
[12:24] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: yo!
[12:25] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Heya!
[12:28] <dimitern> niemeyer: hey!
[12:28] <niemeyer> dimitern: Hey there
[12:28] <dimitern> niemeyer: would you like to take a look at this - https://codereview.appspot.com/7181046/
[12:34] <jam> mgz, wallyworld_, dimitern: I just sent you guys an email with the security keys, etc you'll need. I used your public GPG keys, but if you need help figuring out how to decode them, just ask.
[12:34] <dimitern> jam: cheers
[12:37] <dimitern> jam: yep, I have to replace that PGP key for which I forgot the passphrase a long time ago
[12:38] <dimitern> jam: I'll do it today and you can resend it with my new key perhaps?
[12:42] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: small CL to make add multiple addrs to the API: https://codereview.appspot.com/7197043/
[12:43] <niemeyer> dimitern: CHecking
[12:43] <dimitern> thanks
[12:43] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Super, thanks
[12:45] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Btw, have you had a chance to check that bug Dave filed?
[12:45] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: which one?
[12:45] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: The one saying bootstrap is broken
[12:46] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i couldn't reproduce it. i suspect he was running without --upload-tools.
[12:47] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Have you tried in the regions he suggested?
[12:47] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Or at least one of them?
[12:48] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i'll do that. the error in the bug report "error: API entity name not found in configuration" should not be possible to happen in the branch he was talking about.
[12:48] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: but there may well be another bug
[12:48] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: I'm poking because he asked there, so it'd be good to at least interact to clarify the bug
[12:49] <niemeyer> Since Dave isn't on the same timezone, if we don't get back to him on async locations, we won't talk
[12:51] <niemeyer> dimitern: Any significant change to the ec2 logic on that bootstrap function?
[12:52] <dimitern> niemeyer: how do you mean?
[12:52] <dimitern> niemeyer: no, it's essentially the same
[12:52] <dimitern> niemeyer: the Bootstrap() code, that is
[12:54] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i'm trying it now
[12:55] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Thanks a lot
[12:55] <niemeyer> dimitern: Cool, I was really just curious if there was anything that had to be done differently there
[12:55] <niemeyer> dimitern: It's great that there isn't (except for Roger's point in the CL, which I agree with)
[12:56] <niemeyer> dimitern: Have you seen rogpeppe's comment?
[12:56] <niemeyer> dimitern: Are there consistency issues there too?
[12:56] <dimitern> niemeyer: well, it's seems not - both tests (svc doubles and live) pass - although on canonistack the lack of floating IPs fails the test, but everything else works
[12:57] <dimitern> niemeyer: about consistency - not sure how to test that, but I've run into other consistency issues with OS on some API calls
[12:57] <niemeyer> dimitern: Oh, consistency issues and "seems" don't go well together :-)
[12:58] <niemeyer> dimitern: The idea, in S3, is that the answer is totally arbitrary for an undefined period of time
[12:58] <rogpeppe> dimitern: i suggest starting without any of the eventual-consistency loops, and seeing if things still work.
[12:58] <niemeyer> dimitern: You create, and it's not there.. you delete, and it's still there
[12:58] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Please no
[12:58] <dimitern> niemeyer: I've had the same issues with swift while doing live tests
[12:58] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: We already have the logic for that.. let's not introduce the bug to see if we can hit it
[12:59] <dimitern> niemeyer: creating/deleting/modifying containers in quick succession
[12:59] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: I agree with you cleaner would be better, but let's ask someone that actually knows that stuff if OpenStack is consistent or not
[12:59] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i suppose so. but if there are no such issues in openstack, then that code is more complex for no good reason
[12:59] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: yes, that's a good plan
[13:00] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Sure, that's the part I agree.. I just don't think rolling back something we know works well to wait for the bug is great
[13:00] <niemeyer> dimitern: Oh, then it has the same issues
[13:00] <dimitern> rogpeppe: well, we can ask yes, but how can it be consistent, when the arch is the same - distributed, multi-tier, API disconnected from the actual service, etc.
[13:00] <niemeyer> dimitern, rogpeppe: I suggest just leaving the same logic there then
[13:01] <dimitern> niemeyer: yeah, I agree
[13:01] <niemeyer> dimitern, rogpeppe: If we start to have a few other backends with the exact same logic of Bootstrap, we should factor it out..
[13:01] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: agreed
[13:01] <niemeyer> dimitern, rogpeppe: That said, I think OpenStack is perhaps too similar to EC2.. I suggest seeing how the others look like before going over the trouble of generalizing
[13:02] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: +1
[13:02] <dimitern> niemeyer: +1 as well - let's not refactor/optimize prematurely :)
[13:06] <niemeyer> dimitern: LGTM
[13:07] <niemeyer> dimitern: Does it work for real already?
[13:07] <dimitern> niemeyer: great, 10x
[13:07] <dimitern> niemeyer: yes it does on canonistack, partially
[13:08] <dimitern> niemeyer: starting the instance works, putting the tools, all ok, except for the floating iP shortage, which fails to add an address to the machine after building
[13:14] <dimitern> rogpeppe: can I consider your review as LGTM as well, with the points mentioned addressed?
[13:15] <rogpeppe> dimitern: i'll have a quick once-over, if that's ok
[13:16] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i have a suspicion that eventual-consistency issues are fouling upload-tools.
[13:16] <dimitern> rogpeppe: you mean repropose it after changes before submitting?
[13:16] <rogpeppe> dimitern: yeah
[13:16] <dimitern> rogpeppe: sure
[13:18] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: ah, no that's not it.
[13:20] <dimitern> rogpeppe: reproposed - https://codereview.appspot.com/7181046/
[13:21] <rogpeppe> dimitern: looking
[13:22] <rogpeppe> dimitern: LGTM
[13:22] <dimitern> rogpeppe: cheers
[13:23] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: bootstrap against sa-east-1 works fine for me, although it failed for me first time because i used a different juju to the one it was uploading
[13:24] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i suspect that was dfc's issue too
[13:24] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Curious.. was the symptom the same?
[13:24] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: similar
[13:25] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: the problem (for me) was that it was making the cloudinit script with an old version of the agent config data structure.
[13:27] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: How did that change again?
[13:27] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: This kind of thing is interesting to observe and keep in mind
[13:27] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: THis is a major breakage
[13:27] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: in my case, i was using a version that produced JSON, not YAML
[13:27] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Ah, that
[13:27] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: the problem is that we're not incrementing the version numbers when we make incompatible changes
[13:28] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: which is of course convenient when we're breaking things all the time, but will lead to these kinds of issue
[13:30] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: actually... i don't think we check that the tools we're uploading are compatible with the version that's running. that should be fixed, if true.
[13:31] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: (not that that would've helped here though
[13:31] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: What I mean is that breaking isn't okay.. the problem is breaking
[13:32] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: and breaking without even being aware that you're breaking
[13:32] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i was very aware that i was making breaking changes
[13:32] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: You should mention that, and coordinate with Dave an update to the tools
[13:33] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Since whatever is up there doesn't work anymore
[13:33] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Just being aware isn't quite enough :)
[13:33] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i was presuming dave was updating the tools on every release, given that every release is breaking backward compatibility, pretty much
[13:34] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Sorry, I'm talking past you
[13:34] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: the next one is going to too - how big a priority for us is preserving backward compatibility currently?
[13:34] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Please coordinate with Dave when you introduce breaking changes.
[13:35] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Thanks.
[13:35] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: will do
[13:43] <rogpeppe> lunch
[14:20] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Please ping once you're back
[14:20] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: ping
[14:20] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Yo :)
[14:20] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Do you have some time for a call in.. 10 mins?
[14:20] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: sure
[14:20] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: COol thanks
[14:32] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Will send the invite
[14:48] <aram> I won't be able to join today's kanban meeting, have to run to some place. mramm, I think this applies to our 1:1 as well (though not 100% yet, I might be back soon enough).
[14:48] <mramm> I may not be able to make the 1 on 1 either
[14:49] <mramm> there are sabdfl meetings all day here in Austin
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[15:02] <rogpeppe> is anyone gonna make the kanban meeting?
[15:02] <rogpeppe> i'll be there if anyone else will
[15:08] <rogpeppe> fwereade, mramm: hiya
[15:08] <rogpeppe> fwereade: how's tricks?
[15:09] <fwereade> rogpeppe, heyhey, not bad thanks
[15:09] <fwereade> rogpeppe, and yourself?
[15:09] <rogpeppe> fwereade: not bad at all thanks, pushing on.
[15:10] <rogpeppe> fwereade: missing your reviews :-)
[15:10] <fwereade> rogpeppe, awesome
[15:10] <fwereade> rogpeppe, I came here with the best of intentions but it's been hard to find the energy ;)
[15:10] <rogpeppe> fwereade: no, i wouldn't expect you to while you're there tbh
[15:11] <fwereade> rogpeppe, jolly good :)
[15:32] <dimitern> fwereade: hey :) how's texas?
=== otubo1 is now known as otubo
[15:52] <niemeyer> Lunch.. biab
[15:55] <fwereade> dimitern, heyhey
[15:55] <fwereade> dimitern, texas is... texan :)
[15:56] <fwereade> dimitern, although that's an unfair thing to say really, this is austin after all
[15:56] <fwereade> dimitern, and I've barely left the hotel actually
[15:56] <fwereade> dimitern, when not working, sleeping has been high priority
[15:56] <fwereade> dimitern, I *am* very happy that my bag was delivered last night
[15:56] <fwereade> dimitern, that's 3 timesin a row now
[15:56] <fwereade> dimitern, tyvm for reviews btw
[15:57] <dimitern> fwereade: wow, lost again?
[15:57] <fwereade> dimitern, yep :/
[15:57] <fwereade> dimitern, I'm getting used to it now though
[15:57] <dimitern> fwereade: np, my pleasure
[15:57] <dimitern> fwereade: hehe, all in there?
[15:57] <fwereade> dimitern, yeah, nothing lost
[15:58] <fwereade> dimitern, all I really suffered was a brief blood-pressure spike at houston
[15:58] <dimitern> fwereade: hmm, that doesn't sound good
[15:58] <dimitern> fwereade: how was the flight?
[15:59] <fwereade> dimitern, only metaphorical -- a brief internal GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[15:59] <fwereade> dimitern, flight was way smoother than I expected given the weather at heathrow
[16:00] <fwereade> dimitern, greenland was covered in clouds, which was a shame, that place is *beautiful* if you have a nice view from 40000ft
[16:00] <dimitern> fwereade: yeah, the cancelled like 250 flights that day
[16:00] <fwereade> dimitern, oof, luckier than I thought then :)
[16:00] <dimitern> luckily you managed to sneak through
[16:01] <fwereade> dimitern, was able to be pretty relaxed about the prospect though, I could always have stayed the night with my sister, she's pretty close
[16:01] <dimitern> fwereade: she always seems around when you're somewhere on a trip :)
[16:01] <fwereade> dimitern, heh, maybe :)
[16:03] <fwereade> hazmat, ping
[16:04] <dimitern> fwereade: we have bootstrap working with openstack now, landed today
[16:04] <fwereade> dimitern, w00t!
[16:04] <dimitern> :)
[16:04] <dimitern> yeah, it's taking shape faster now I think
[16:05] <dimitern> the provider
[16:05] <hazmat> fwereade, pong
[16:05] <fwereade> hazmat, I think we have enough people to discuss identities if you can tear yourelf away
[16:05] <fwereade> hazmat, mramm has been collecting interested parties
[16:08] <rogpeppe> i'd love a review of this branch, if anyone can spare a mo. i'm stacking up stuff on top of it. it shouldn't be too bad, despite the number of files changed: https://codereview.appspot.com/7133063/
[16:55] <rogpeppe> dimitern: unfortunately the branch you reviewed earlier was WIP for a good reason - i hadn't got tests to pass yet!
[16:55] <mgz> minor details :)
[16:56] <rogpeppe> dimitern: i've now updated it so they do, but somehow it was necessary to add some more stuff along the way, and it's acquired a dependency. if you could have another look (and at the dependency too), that'd be great. https://codereview.appspot.com/7197049/
[17:19] <dimitern> rogpeppe: sorry, just saw this
[17:19] <rogpeppe> dimitern: np
[17:19] <dimitern> rogpeppe: I'll take a look now
[17:19] <rogpeppe> dimitern: thanks
[17:20] <dimitern> rogpeppe: while I'm on it, would like to look at https://codereview.appspot.com/7195046
[17:21] <rogpeppe> dimitern: looking
[17:23] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Would be interesting to have your opinion on https://codereview.appspot.com/7149043/
[17:23] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: as you're working right around it
[17:24] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i've pinged dfc for a conversation about this
[17:24] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: hopefully we'll have one tonight
[17:24] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i think it's the wrong thing to do, but he might have better plans than me, so i want a chat before commenting too much
[17:25] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: What seems wrong, specifically?
[17:25] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Looks quite straightforward to me
[17:25] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i think it should be a machiner job, not a new subcommand
[17:26] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Ah, indeed
[17:26] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: then it works at the same level as the API server, and in the future we'll be able to dynamically adjust servers etc
[17:26] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Agreed
[17:26] <dimitern> rogpeppe: you've got a review
[17:26] <rogpeppe> dimitern: thanks a lot
[17:26] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Would you mind to point that out in the CL?
[17:26] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Even if you include "Let's talk live about it."?
[17:26] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: ok, i will do
[17:27] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Thanks!
[17:27] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: The stater itself looked nice.. I've skimmed over too quickly thinking it was a job as well
[17:28] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: yes, the stater itself is ok, but i'm not sure it works very well as a task
[17:28] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: most of the logic is fine though
[17:29] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Maybe it needs additional stuff, but what's there seems well structured, and necessary
[17:30] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: yes. i'm not entirely sure that worker/stater is the right place, but all the unpacking and running logic is good, which makes up the bulk.
[17:30] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Seems right as a worker too
[17:30] <dimitern> mgz: ping
[17:31] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i was wondering if the tar unpacking code might live nicely in a standalone package, but it's probably ok where it is until we need it elsewhere.
[17:31] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Indeed
[17:33] <rogpeppe> niemeyer: i'm going to try to catch dave tonight - about when he starts work.
[17:33] <niemeyer> rogpeppe: Super, cheers
[17:44] <dimitern> niemeyer: if you have time, take a look at https://codereview.appspot.com/7195046/
[17:52]  * rogpeppe just started running first live test that connects to the API server... i wonder if it'll work.
[18:00] <mgz> rogpeppe: did it? :)
[18:00] <rogpeppe> mgz: still running...
[18:01] <rogpeppe> mgz: oh, darn
[18:01] <rogpeppe> mgz: failed
[18:01] <mgz> ;_;
[18:01] <dimitern> mgz: ah, you're here :) can you look at this https://codereview.appspot.com/7195046/ - especially the way private and public addresses are discovered (ported the logic from py-juju)
[18:01] <mgz> dimitern: sure
[18:02] <dimitern> mgz: thanks
[18:02] <mgz> you ported the tests too, right? :)
[18:03] <dimitern> mgz: well, not really, but I test for all paths I think
[18:03] <mgz> the tests are the bit with value, because they cover the sort of json I actually saw in the wild
[18:04] <dimitern> mgz: I see, then I could port their essence as well
[18:07] <mgz> hm... and GetServerAddresses really shouldn't be needed, it's included in servers/{}/detail which juju is likely using in all cases
[18:08] <dimitern> mgz: unfortunately, it's not the same always
[18:09] <mgz> that's an ongoing issue though, the ip/name bindings aren't static
[18:09] <mgz> unless you mean something else?
[18:09] <dimitern> mgz: sometimes (at startup, but it happened to me multiple times after some uptime) the address fields are empty there, while the /ips returns them correctly
[18:09] <mgz> right
[18:10] <mgz> well, ips will only work once a binding exists
[18:10] <mgz> but that's pretty much the same thing
[18:10] <dimitern> what binding?
[18:10] <dimitern> i'm not talking about floating ips
[18:11] <mgz> when you first start a machine, you get details back before the networking setup is done
[18:11] <dimitern> the automatic ones nova assigns at boot
[18:11] <mgz> there's a hack you might notice in the python code that polls for contents of addresses in launch in one case (where you need to assign a floating ip)
[18:11] <dimitern> mgz: yes, but even after that /servers/detail won't get me the addresses - they're always empty
[18:12] <mgz> they're not always empty, they're just initially empty
[18:12] <dimitern> mgz: well, /ips works even at BUILD, while /servers/detail doesn't
[18:12] <mgz> I think because it reflects current reality rather than intent or something
[18:12] <mgz> it works at BUILD, just not straight away, only when it's actually bound
[18:13] <mgz> anyway, this might be a neat trick for the moment
[18:14] <dimitern> anyway, it's not reliable to use /servers/detail for addresses in my experience
[18:14] <dimitern> and having it this way simplifies the tests / doubles a bit
[18:15] <mgz> really juju needs to learn that addresses aren't reliable
[18:15] <dimitern> :)
[18:15] <dimitern> especially if they float
[18:15] <mgz> but if this hacks around that broken assumption for now, it's not the end of the world
[18:17] <dimitern> yeah
[18:21] <rogpeppe> mgz: i was listening on localhost!
[18:24] <rogpeppe> time to stop
[18:24] <rogpeppe> g'night all
[18:25] <dimitern> rogpeppe: c u
[18:30] <mgz> dimitern: commented, fine overall, but I think much of that code should live in juju-core
[18:30] <dimitern> mgz: thanks, I'll think about it some more tomorrow
[20:14] <fwereade> davecheney, ping
[20:38] <fwereade> davecheney, I need to head to meetings in a few minutes but I should be on again in a couple of hours, let me know if I can clarify anything...
[22:01] <rogpeppe> davecheney: ping
[22:18] <davecheney> rogpeppe: ack
[22:18] <rogpeppe> davecheney: yo!
[22:18] <rogpeppe> davecheney: G+?
[22:19] <davecheney> sure
[22:23] <davecheney> ringing ...
[22:23] <davecheney> this is fucking annoying
[22:23] <davecheney> can we use Skype like grownups ?
