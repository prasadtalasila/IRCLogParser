[02:04] <BWMerlin> I am trying to install a game under wine and it complains that I do not have glxinfo but I am unsure which glxinfo version I should install
[02:04] <BWMerlin> I have an nvidia graphics card and I am using the official nvidia driver
[02:05] <BWMerlin> my options are glx-alternative-fglrx   glx-alternative-nvidia  glx-alternative-mesa    glx-diversions
[02:05] <mysteriousdaren> BWMerlin: glx-alternative-nvidia
[02:06] <BWMerlin> The following packages have unmet dependencies: glx-alternative-nvidia : Depends: glx-diversions (= 0.2.2) Depends: glx-alternative-mesa E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
[02:06] <BWMerlin> :S
[02:06] <BWMerlin> that doesn't sound good
[02:08] <mysteriousdaren> go to synaptic and fix broken drivers
[02:11] <BWMerlin> how exactly do I do that?
[02:50] <heywood> hi all.
[02:50] <heywood> trying to map Fn-F3 onto a command using Settings>Keyboard>Shortcuts>(Custom Shortcuts). but when i assign that key combo to my command, it reads "Screensaver" as opposed to (say) Ctrl+Alt+F or whatever. Any idea how to change this?
[02:53] <tsimpson> the Fn key is a modifier key, it maps a key to another keycode, for instance my Fn+l is PageDown
[02:54] <heywood> tsimpson: right. xev says (i think) it maps to keycode 160. is there a way to trap that particular code and "attach" it to a command (in my case, i want: sleep 1 && xset dpms force off)?
[02:54] <heywood> this used to work out of the box with ubuntu 10.04 on the same hardware...
[02:57] <heywood> or rather, the keyboard on this machine (thinkpad T43) has a "screen off" icon at Fn-F3. that worked on 10.04 without having to do any keystroke remapping at all.
[02:57] <mysteriousdaren> BWMerlin: i'd remove orphaned libraries too
[02:58] <tsimpson> well it's saying that the code from Fn+F3 is the "Screensaver" key, if I press Fn+F6 it says the key is "Monitor Brightness Down"
[02:59] <BWMerlin> mysteriousdaren: I tried fix broken dependencies but that didn't do anything
[02:59] <heywood> tsimpson: ok, but does that mean it can't be mapped to that command i mentioned?
[03:00] <heywood> btw, are you using xev to find these mappings, or looking them up somewhere?
[03:00] <mysteriousdaren> BWMerlin: Sorry I just got a phone call, ask your question again in #ubuntu
[03:00] <tsimpson> I think it should be able to, but it may do more than one thing at a time
[03:01] <tsimpson> heywood: I just opened a Configure Shortcuts... option in an application and started pressing buttons ;)
[03:01] <BWMerlin> I have and the answers are add odds
[03:01] <BWMerlin> one is saying wine doesn't work with 64bit which I know is not true
[03:01] <mysteriousdaren> Yes it does work, lol that's a stupid answer
[03:03] <Combat_Wombat> lol
[03:04] <Combat_Wombat> whoever told you that should be shot
[03:04] <BWMerlin> yes i know
[03:05] <BWMerlin> others are saying the game is really hard to get working but the instructions are very clear I am just running into some dependency problems
[03:05] <Combat_Wombat> what game?
[03:24] <BWMerlin> league of legends
[03:24] <BWMerlin> I am following the instructions here http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=19141 to install and then here http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2957372 to configure
[03:24] <heywood> tsimpson: what i want is to map that key combo to work for _any_ application. in other words, to override any application-specific commands mapped to Fn+F3

[20:33] <MangoBoy> Hi. i saw lubuntu 12.04 was not longtime support as there were short of maintainers, but what does that mean? my friend says ofcource it is LTS as it is built on ubuntu..??
[20:34] <Unit193> The core of it, the kernel, is LTS, but the LXDE (or the "L" part) isn't LTS.
[20:35] <Unit193> There is a shortage of devs for the Lubuntu project, and even the other flavors (They have 3 year LTS rather than 5 as mainbuntu does)
[20:36] <MangoBoy> Ok but thats overcomable isnt it? cant one patch that manualy some how? or what i mean is that the security will be maintained is'nt it?
[20:38] <Unit193> Well, kernel issues would be since it's part of the core.
[20:39] <MangoBoy> so what can become a problem then?
[20:45] <Zanzacar> Hi I know ubuntu but I am having issues with lubuntu. I want to install this https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/linpsk/ but I can't figure out how to make it happen
[20:45] <Unit193> Just the LXDE bits, and some things get dated without them getting backported.  Also means it wouldn't be supported here.
[20:45] <Zanzacar> I know that is a ubuntu package location but I can't find it for lubuntu and I would think they are similar enough
[20:46] <Unit193> Zanzacar: Try opening a terminal and typing  sudo apt-get install linpsk.
[20:46] <Zanzacar> tried that it isn't found
[20:47] <Zanzacar> i thought I might add the repositories or something but I really wasn't sure on this informaiton since I don't know what repository I would need to add
[20:47] <Unit193> You need universe enabled, and try sudo apt-get update first.
[20:48] <Zanzacar> universe that right I have delt with that before but I forget now, I tried update then install linpsk and still not found
[20:49] <Zanzacar> here is another site with the software but I can't find the ppa repository
[20:49] <Zanzacar> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linpsk
[20:52] <Unit193> Zanzacar: Try opening "Software Sources" to make sure Universe is enabled, as you see at http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/hamradio/linpsk, it is in precise.
[20:53] <Zanzacar> universe is not enabled I am looking that up right now
[20:57] <Zanzacar> finally figured it out, I was trying to manually add universe but there was a check box.
[20:57] <Zanzacar> clicked that did update, then install linpsk and it worked just fine :)
[20:58] <Zanzacar> thanks for the help
[21:00] <Unit193> Sure.
[21:15] <mysteriousdaren> Unit193: how are you?
[21:16] <Unit193> mysteriousdaren: My pulse would indicate that I am alive, though there are still reports that I'm an AI so the pulse is a lie.  Take your pick.
[21:17] <mysteriousdaren> I prefer the first one.
[21:27] <Noskcaj> how can i setup conky in lubuntu, ideally with this theme? http://www.noobslab.com/2012/06/install-infinity-conky-in-ubuntulinux.html

[23:38] <Derpyeah> Hi
[23:38] <Derpyeah> Anyone here?
[23:42] <Combat_Wombat> many people
[23:44] <Derpyeah> I bought a Action Replay 3ds and plugged it into my lubuntu laptop and It doesn't get detected.
[23:44] <Derpyeah> Even though the software for it works awesome in wine
[23:44] <Derpyeah> and I installed the drivers...
