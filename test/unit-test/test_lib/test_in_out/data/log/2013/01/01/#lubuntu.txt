[02:04] <i3ear> I have a question about installing wine, it says here: http://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu that I need to go to edit>software sources, but I can find no such menu in lubuntu software center
[02:04] <i3ear> can anyone help me?
[02:04] <i3ear> is anyone here?
[02:05] <i3ear> can you help me?
[02:06] <Unit193> i3ear: No, just search for wine in software center.
[02:07] <i3ear> Unit193, but won't that just install the binaries and not install the required libraries?
[02:07] <i3ear> Unit193, it is clear that this step involves installing the required libraries to make the binaries run
[02:08] <Unit193> i3ear: That's all you need to use wine, the extra PPA is just their most recent version.
[02:08] <i3ear> Unit193, alright I will give it a try. if I have any more problems will you still be here?
[02:11] <Unit193> Maybe, someone else may if I'm not.
[02:12] <i3ear> alright. is there a tutorial you could point me out to about  using wine by any chance?
[02:15] <i3ear> I forgot! I have another question: I already have lubuntu installed, how can I set my /home directory to my second hard disk drive?
[02:16] <i3ear> I didn't do it the first time because the installer was giving me major problems about dual booting with windows xp when I decided that I should just run linux fully and run my windows programs with wine
[02:17] <i3ear> so when I installed it over windows xp I just went with the easiest, and what I perceived to be the most reliable option
[02:18] <Unit193> Generally for wine: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine not sure if it's up to date: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving
[02:22] <i3ear> thank you very much, you have been a huge help. By any chance do you have tutorials about things like... how to install programs properly using terminal, how to access all the components I currently have installed on linux, and things of that nature related to the natural indepth use of linux, as well as a tutorial on how to use jack?
[02:22] <i3ear> I am sorry I have a lot of questions but I have large needs for computers :(
[02:33] <Unit193> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoftwareManagement  has several different ways of installing and managing software, and there are manpages for most programs.  Jack isn't something I've messed with, but pretty sure the wiki has info, and I know the arch wiki does.
[02:34] <i3ear> Unit193, thank you  very much, you have been a big help
[02:53] <ro_> I have yet another problem. the resolution on my display does not match my monitor. when I go to change the display it won't let me checkmark "turn on"
[02:53] <ro_> it only started doing this after my latest restart to fix a crashing program
[02:53] <ro_> did I mention that  my computer is really old? by the way this is i3ear from last time
[02:55] <Unit193> You could check for "Additional Drivers", but I think it'd be more worth while to try generating an xorg.conf file.
[02:56] <Unit193> Check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
[02:56] <Unit193> !xorg.conf
[02:56] <ubottu> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type « sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart » in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
[03:08] <ro_> I get an error when I try to run rm ~/.config/monitors.xml off of the tutorial https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution I get an error: rm: invalid option -- '/' (next line) try 'rm  --help' for more information.
[03:17] <ro_> hello?
[03:52] <ro_> I also tried reseting xwindows but I got an error: "sudo: /etc/init.d/?dm: command not found

[16:02] <ro_> I am having major issues with lubuntu. This is the 4th time I have installed it
[16:03] <jude0> with?
[16:03] <ro_> the last time I installed it, when I turned it on it would boot past the bios just fine but when lubuntu started up the screen was just black
[16:03] <ro_> I had to reinstall lubuntu from the disk
[16:03] <jude0> and you are sure you waited long enough?
[16:03] <ro_> by the way the disk is outdated because the latest version of lubuntu could not fit on the 700mb cdrs I have
[16:04] <ro_> yes I am sure, my monitor said "no signal" for quite a while
[16:04] <jude0> and you did it on the motherboards native video controller?
[16:04] <ro_> anyway, this is a fresh install and as soon as I booted up the computer I got "an unexpected error has happened"
[16:05] <ro_> yes, I tried both my onboard and my... my videocard... forgot what kind it is, from the middle of 2003
[16:06] <jude0> do you know how far into the boot you got before you got the error?
[16:06] <ro_> alright the error happened on this latest install of the system on my computer. I got the error as soon as I saw the desktop
[16:06] <jude0> oh
[16:07] <jude0> did you try erasing the home directory?
[16:07] <jude0> it's possible that permissions for the home directory somehow got changed
[16:08] <ro_> what do you mean? I reformatted both my hdds, set my root and swap partitions on my first and my home on my second
[16:08] <jude0> ah so it was on your initial login
[16:08] <ro_> yes, my initial login
[16:08] <ro_> here we go I have an error open
[16:09] <ro_> "sorry, ubuntu 12.04 has experienced an internal error"
[16:09] <jude0> out of curiosity could you pastebin you system hardware specs
[16:10] <ro_> you mean like my cpu speed or the make and models?
[16:11] <jude0> the more the better
[16:11] <jude0> gpu especially
[16:11] <ro_> is there a hardware analasis program I could download to get all the information you need?
[16:11] <jude0> oh so you have another linux running on that hardware?
[16:12] <ro_> no it is just one install of linux
=== Guest2811 is now known as fragalot
[16:13] <jude0> well if you can live distro it and run hardinfo it can generate reports
[16:14] <ro_> I am running off of the linux I installed right now
[16:14] <ro_> I am having no real problems with this latest install but I am worried because all my previous installs have failed
[16:15] <ro_> that is what I want help with
[16:15] <jude0> i am assuming a different linux distro than (l)ubuntu
[16:15] <jude0> (that you are running off of)
[16:17] <ro_> nope I am running off of lubuntu
[16:17] <jude0> so the 5th? time you installed it... it just worked?
[16:19] <ro_> the first 2 times I installed it I tried getting it to dual boot between lubuntu and windows XP but I could never get grub to work so I just abandoned that and decided to just run 100% linux, then the third time I installed it it worked for a day, and then the screen resolution wouldn't change so I had to change monitors.
[16:19] <ro_> then I turned it off
[16:19] <ro_> when I turned it back on, the thing with the screen not showing
[16:20] <ro_> that happened
[16:20] <ro_> so I reinstalled lubuntu again and now I am talking to you
[16:21] <jude0> did you try to install proprietary grafix drivers?
[16:21] <ro_> http://pastebin.com/cuKZGFqT
[16:22] <ro_> by the way the specs you wanted
[16:22] <ro_> I am not sure how, my graphics card is a nvidia geforce 5200
[16:26] <ro_> arg
[16:26] <jude0> hi
[16:26] <ro_> sorry, you still there? what did I miss?
[16:26] <ro_> hello
[16:26] <jude0> so your goal is to mitigate the graphics issue or is it to dual boot your system?
[16:26] <ro_> my goal is to prevent my computer from just randomly breaking on me
[16:27] <ro_> like it has in the past
[16:27] <ro_> I just want a stable single install of lubuntu with my home on my second hard disk drive
[16:27] <ro_> I want to know why lubuntu keeps bugging out on me
[16:27] <jude0> ah so its a multi harddrive install
[16:27] <ro_> yes
[16:28] <jude0> all your graphics issues probably have to do with your nvidia card
[16:29] <jude0> in order to fix it you will have to get proprietary drivers (assuming that the unproprietary ones don't work well enough)
[16:29] <ro_> how do I do that? just go to the nvidia website?
[16:31] <jude0> http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-amd64-173.14.36-driver.html
[16:31] <jude0> assuming you have a 64bit linux install
[16:31] <ro_> nope, 32 bit
[16:31] <jude0> why not 64?
[16:31] <jude0> your hardware supports it
[16:31] <ro_> because this computer is at least 9 years old
[16:32] <ro_> are you sure?
[16:32] <jude0> assuming you have this http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/K8/AMD-Sempron%2064%202600+%20-%20SDA2600AIO2BX%20(SDA2600BXBOX).html
[16:32] <jude0> then yes
[16:34] <ro_> huh
[16:34] <ro_> didn't know that
[16:35] <ro_> but I don't have a dvd burner
[16:35] <ro_> would it be worth it to just reinstall a 64 bit operating system?
[16:35] <TheLordOfTime> s/reinstall/install/
[16:35] <TheLordOfTime> if you're not using 64bit on a 64bit processor you're not using the full abilities of the processor.
[16:36] <TheLordOfTime> and if your RAM is more than 4GB, you can only truly use it with 64bit
[16:36] <jude0> his ram is 768MBs
[16:36] <ro_> yup
[16:37] <jude0> i have many computers and i just like to match all their software as close as possible... haven't done a 32bit install in like half a decade
[16:37] <jude0> but as far as your time is worth to you, it might not be worth it
[16:37] <TheLordOfTime> ah
[16:37] <ro_> huh, it might be the rural area I live in but I didn't think that 64 bit computers were that old
[16:37] <TheLordOfTime> if he's on that low a RAM, the overhead'll not be worth it
[16:38] <jude0> http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-ia32-173.14.36-driver.html for the 32bit driver
[16:40] <ro_> how do I run it?
[16:40] <jude0> lemi check
[16:40] <TheLordOfTime> probably download and then run a .run
[16:40] <jude0> if you go to the additional tab on that link i provided it shows you one way
[16:41] <jude0> "additional information"
[16:41] <jude0> i would recommend doing it without running an xserver
[16:42] <jude0> not that you NEED to with nvidia like you often do with amds, but you will probably run into less issues if anything does go wrong
[16:42] <TheLordOfTime> nvidia's smart
[16:42] <TheLordOfTime> it won't modprobe the driver  until a reboot i think
[16:42] <jude0> i don't know about that
[16:42] <TheLordOfTime> last i updated the driver anyways
[16:43] <ro_> I don't know if I am running an xserver or not, should I worry about it?
[16:43] <jude0> you are, but i guess you can try normal and then if everything blows up then you have to go to shell way anyway
[16:44] <jude0> they used to have a feature in lubuntu to make it all easy with installing proprietary drivers. I think they took it out though.
[16:45] <jude0> for me that was one of the selling features too
[16:47] <ro_> I tried putting in the nvidia command, I even put the path to the file before the file name
[16:47] <ro_> nothing works
[16:51] <jude0> hmm
[16:51] <jude0> what response do you get from the command?
[16:52] <ro_> sh: 0: Can't open NVIDIA-Linux-x86-173.14.36.pkg1.run
[16:52] <ro_> I cd to the folder that it is in then I ran the command that nvidia gives
[16:53] <jude0> sounds like a type or wrong directory somehow
[16:54] <ro_> the directory is right, in terminal I am in the right directory
[16:54] <jude0> did you apend a ./ before the filename?
[16:55] <ro_> how do you mean?
[16:55] <ro_> like
[16:55] <jude0> sh ./NVIDIA...
[16:55] <ro_> no I did not
[16:56] <ro_> sh: 0: Can't open ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-173.14.36.pkg1.run
[16:56] <ro_> the error I got
[16:56] <jude0> what do you get when you ls that dir
[16:57] <ro_> NVIDIA-Linux-x86-173.14.36-pkg1.run
[16:57] <jude0> i see a dash you missed
[16:58] <jude0> -pkg not .pkg
[16:58] <ro_> you are right
[16:58] <jude0> in the future you might want to try just hitting tab for autocomplete
[16:59] <jude0> then you don't have to worry about typos as much
[16:59] <ro_> I did not know that you could do that
[16:59] <ro_> alright so it gave me an error, the installer said that I have to run it as root
[16:59] <jude0> so you would go like sh ./NVI[hi tab]
[16:59] <ro_> so I should put a sudo before that command?
[17:00] <jude0> you are installing drivers... drivers always need full priv's because you are modifying the computer
[17:02] <ro_> I see. It gave me a new error. "Unable to find the system utilities 'ld' ; please make sure you have the package 'binutils' installed. If you do have binutils installed then please check that 'ld' is in your PATH.
[17:02] <jude0> so install binutils... after that it will probably error again asking for linux headers
[17:07] <ro_> hey
[17:07] <jude0> yea
[17:07] <ro_> when I see usr in a command line I am supposed to type in, do I type usr or my account name?
[17:08] <jude0> "/usr" is a directory do you mean "user:"?
[17:08] <ro_> the command is ../binutils-2.13/configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared &&
[17:10] <jude0> is NVIDIA doing this or you? because i am pretty sure you do not need to config the binutils any more than default
[17:10] <ro_> I am using this guide http://www.faqs.org/docs/linux_scratch/chapter06/binutils.html
[17:10] <ro_> to install binutils
[17:11] <jude0> so are you building it for fun(more work) or do you not know apt utilities or package manager?
[17:12] <ro_> I do not know either of those things, I just figured that I could just google "terminal command for (blank)"
[17:13] <jude0> na... your are making it hard for yourself
[17:13] <jude0> in the ubuntu variants you have a graphical package manager called synaptic
[17:13] <jude0> i would start there
[17:15] <ro_> alright
[17:16] <jude0> two of the most important feature of linux for me are 1: the package management system and 2: ksplice
[17:17] <ro_> ahh crap, it gave me an error: "You appear to be running an X server; please exit x before installing. For further details please see blah blah"
[17:17] <jude0> so you found synaptic in your menu?
[17:17] <ro_> yes I did, got it installed too
[17:18] <jude0> so x11 is the xserver you are running
[17:18] <ro_> yes, I installed binutils and when I trid running the installer again I got the above error
[17:19] <ro_> I see. so how do I turn it off so I can install this thing, then restart windowsx?
[17:19] <jude0> oh binutils doesn't like X i thought that the nvidea dont
[17:21] <ro_> ahh
[17:21] <jude0> i am pretty sure binutils shouldn't care that you are running x
[17:22] <ro_> the nvidia installer cares that I am running x
[17:22] <jude0> yes that makes sense now.
[17:23] <ro_> it is telling me to exit x before installing
[17:23] <jude0> yea well x is everything that is graphical
[17:23] <ro_> so how do I shut down x then start it back up so I am not completly lost?
[17:23] <jude0> so you pretty much have to drop into run level 3 install it then go back into runlevel 5
[17:24] <jude0> do you know about the builtin terminals in debian?
[17:24] <ro_> no I do not
[17:24] <jude0> like CTRL+ALT+F7
[17:24] <ro_> I don't know any linux shortcuts
[17:24] <jude0> so if you go CTRL+ALT+F1
[17:25] <jude0> it will bring up a terminal
[17:25] <jude0> the f7 one gets you back to your current session
[17:33] <ro_> sorry about all that
[17:33] <ro_> I uhm... whell I figured out how to open up terminal, but I missed the part about getting back from terminal, so I just rebooted out of it
[17:33] <ro_> and now I am having the same exact problem I had with my last install
[17:34] <ro_> I can't change my resolution so I can't set it in the correct range of the monitor I want to use (right now I am using my backup monitor)
[17:35] <ro_> I go to system tools> monitor setting. Then I change the resolution but when I click apply I get an error "you can't turn off all monitor"
[17:35] <ro_> it won't let me check the box near the "turn on" option in the settings
[17:35] <jude0> well lets get the drivers installed
[17:35] <ro_> alright
[17:35] <jude0> hopefully the problem goes away
[17:36] <ro_> indeed
[17:36] <jude0> so yea the ctrl+alt+f7 is your main session(the one you are in now)
[17:36] <ro_> I see
[17:36] <jude0> that is why i said that one first
[17:37] <jude0> i was hoping to mitigate exactly what you did
[17:37] <ro_> so ctrl+alt+f1 is to get to terminal and ctrl+alt+f7 is to get back?
[17:37] <ro_> hah yeah sorry...
[17:37] <jude0> well to be exact f1-6 are terminals and f7-12 are supposed to be sessions
[17:38] <jude0> so the theory is you have one terminal for every session
[17:38] <jude0> thats why it is f7
[17:38] <ro_> I see
[17:39] <jude0> so with priv's you will need to go to the terminal execute "init 3" and then when you are done installing the drivers "init 5"
[17:39] <jude0> in debian there are 6 runlevels
[17:40] <jude0> 0 is off 6 is reboot and 5 is the one you are currently in
[17:40] <ro_> do I just type "init 3"?
[17:40] <jude0> not yet
[17:40] <ro_> alright
[17:40] <jude0> 3 is no xserver aka no graphics
[17:40] <ro_> right
[17:42] <jude0> so you will want to go to a terminal... ideally f1 because f1 is the matching terminal for f7 although it really doesnt matter, and then drop run levels install drivers, go back to graphics run level then reboot
[17:42] <ro_> alright
[17:42] <jude0> good luck
[17:42] <ro_> how do I change the run level?
[17:42] <jude0> init
[17:42] <ro_> alright
[17:44] <ro_> alright, tried that. Got the same error. I did it just as you told me to
[17:45] <ro_> sudo init 3, sudo sh ./Nvidiadriver
[17:45] <jude0> which error?
[17:45] <ro_> "close x to install"
[17:47] <jude0> so init 3 doesn't work on lubuntu anymore? i guess it's possible
[17:47] <ro_> hmmm, so now what?
[17:49] <jude0> init 2
[17:51] <ro_> alright
[17:52] <ro_> didn't work
[17:53] <jude0> maybe they changed inittab
[17:53] <jude0> there are other ways don't worry
[17:54] <jude0> in debian another feature is service management. so if you type "service [servicename] stop" it kills it
[17:54] <jude0> and then start starts it
[17:55] <jude0> the service i beleive we want to stop is lightdm
[17:55] <jude0> dm=desktop manager
[17:57] <ro_> I see
[17:58] <jude0> i haven't tested it but i beleive if you were to stop the lightdm service then it will also kill x
[17:58] <ro_> and if I started lightdm it would start x?
[17:58] <jude0> definately
[17:59] <jude0> if x is ever dead you can always run "startx" its kinda hard to kill though
[17:59] <ro_> I see
[18:00] <jude0> so might as well give the service lightdm stop a try
[18:00] <ro_> alright, now to try it

[20:37] <Fonzee> Can I install Lubuntu on an Ubuntu 12 installation while keeping my stuff?
[20:50] <dencrypt> yes
[21:01] <maraz> Hm. I have three computers which aren't suspending their monitors when inactive, independent of the power management settings. The displays turn off properly and then turn on again but with a black screen.
