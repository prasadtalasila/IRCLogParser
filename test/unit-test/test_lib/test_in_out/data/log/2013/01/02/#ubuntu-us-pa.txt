[13:47] <HowdyDoody> How to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 with liveCD and all drives in LVM (logical volume mgr) ??
[17:01] <pleia2> HowdyDoody: afaik the livecd installer doesn't support lvm until 12.10
[17:02] <pleia2> (I've never done an upgrade with a CD though)
[17:46] <ChinnoDog> I thought you needed alt CD to do that
[17:58] <waltman> All you Apple haters will enjoy this: http://www.macrumors.com/2013/01/01/apple-promotes-do-not-disturb-in-tv-ad-on-same-day-as-new-years-day-bug-discovered/
[17:58] <waltman> And yes, before you ask, I'm being affected by that. :)
[18:35] <JonathanD> So the mode gets stuck on?
[19:09] <waltman> Something like that, yes. Rebooting doesn't fix it.
[19:10] <waltman> http://www.macrumors.com/2013/01/02/apple-says-do-not-disturb-bug-to-resolve-itself-on-monday-january-7th/ # gee, thanks
[19:11] <JonathanD> So you can't recieve calls?
[19:11] <waltman> hmm...
[19:11] <waltman> Let me try.
[19:12] <waltman> Nope, it goes right to voicemail!
[19:12] <waltman> let's turn that off...
[19:12] <JonathanD> Until the 7th...
[19:22] <JonathanD> waltman: you're able to turn off the feture though?
[19:23] <waltman> nod
[19:23] <JonathanD> Oh, I see, you can turn it off but it does not turn itself off as scheduled.
[19:24] <waltman> The bit about not receiving calls is a bit complex. It will still allow calls from your "Favorites", and also anyone who calls back within 3 minutes.
[19:25] <JonathanD> Apparently date/time is hard.
[19:25] <JonathanD> I'm thinking about coming to plug tonight.
[19:26] <waltman> excellent
[19:29] <waltman> how's your car holding up?
[19:29] <JonathanD> It is very thirsty.
[19:30] <JonathanD> I can make it to the city and back, though.
[19:30] <waltman> Do you now this because of your new monitor thingy?
[19:30] <JonathanD> I think.
[19:30] <JonathanD> It helps.
[19:30] <waltman> s/now/know/
[19:30] <JonathanD> I was thinking of building a water level sensor, though.
[19:30] <JonathanD> Seems like it'd be quite easy.
[20:02] <MutantTurkey> Break is killing me, seriously, i have no responsiblity and therefore nothing to do
[20:07] <waltman> MutantTurkey: You should be studying calculus!
[20:07] <MutantTurkey> I have been reviewing
[20:07] <MutantTurkey> and reading
[20:07] <MutantTurkey> but cmon only so much can be done
[20:08] <waltman> or maybe watching the Sunderland - Liverpool match on ESPN2 :)
[20:45] <MutantTurkey> i have my desktop on all day, id like to seed some good stuiff for people
[20:45] <MutantTurkey> so far I am just seeding a bunch of debian isos
