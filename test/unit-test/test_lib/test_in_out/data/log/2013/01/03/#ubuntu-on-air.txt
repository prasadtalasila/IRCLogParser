[18:21] <chaslinux> Hi all! Charles, Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. @ work (Computer Recycling).
[18:22] <tuxkalle_> What Display Server does the Phone OS use (Xorg)?
[18:22] <tuxkalle_> Will the phone OS be compatible with all my standard Linux Programs?
[18:23] <tuxkalle_> Will I have a Root Shell and be able to use apt-get and have access to the reposed I currently use?
[18:23] <tuxkalle_>  Will I be able to develop with Python and use things like GTK and PyGame?
[18:23] <craigbass1976> I was wondering that too, or if the phone companies would be like they are now
[18:23] <craigbass1976> with android and ios
[18:24] <craigbass1976> Fah, gtg.  I'm at work...
[18:32] <gymnastics> QUESTION: when is going RO

[18:32] <gymnastics> QUESTION: when is ROM going to be published ? :)
[18:32] <tuxkalle_> #question What Display Server does the Phone OS use (Xorg)?
[18:33] <apt-get_install> i ask the same question as before; recently, the search results in Dash is sended to Amazon. I don't care how encryped the information is, it is still my private searches. Can I be sure that NO INFOMATION at all is sednded to Amazon or any third parties if I turn off logging in the System Setting, or must I log my own outgoing traffic?
[18:34] <imthk2> QUESTION: with ubuntu phone using QT do you plan to move away from gnome/gtk on the desktop?
=== Dana is now known as Guest26632
[18:35] <gymnastics> appreciate that :)
[18:36] <tuxkalle_> #QUESTION  Will the phone OS be compatible with all my standard Linux Programs?
[18:36] <TonyNoOne> Why? Why make an announcement now for a phone build that is so far out? How are we to stay excited?
[18:37] <cielak> QUESTION: are there (already) any plans concerning root access limitations for Ubuntu Phone OS? I mean tricks similar to what may be observed on Android, where you need to grant yourself root access in order to modify OS's core components, which voids warranty - this makes sense as it is a way to prevent users from screwing up system stuff., but results in the OS not being completely *open*, as some things can't be done by any application, and
[18:37] <cielak>  need to be done by something build-in into OS instead. Are there plans to keep Ubuntu Phone open in this matter, or will mobile manufacturers/vendors be able to lock down the phone by limiting root access?
[18:38] <sepisoad> QUESTION: Will "ubuntu phone" Image be available for Nexus 7 or 10?
