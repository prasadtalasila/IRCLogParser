[06:17] <Sarvatt> wrouesnel: how is radeon broken? do you mean fglrx? need more context there
[06:18] <wrouesnel> Sarvatt: radeon as in the open-source driver
[06:19] <Sarvatt> its broken for you? what release, what gpu, when did it start being broken?
[06:20] <Sarvatt> hows it broken, corruption or not working at all?
[06:20] <wrouesnel> Sarvatt: gpu is a cayman pro [radeon 6950]. the driver was broken on the last update to the xorg-edgers ppa
[06:21] <wrouesnel> Sarvatt: it's broken in the sense that the framebuffer driver initializes improperly (corrupted output on DVI) and launching Cinnamon (or any window manager that uses opengl) leads to a mangled display.
[06:22] <wrouesnel> changing settings like color tiling doesn't help at all, and (i'm guessing this is the bug report i put on launchpad) i get a lot of that message in ~/.xsession-errors when I try to start a display manager.
[06:22] <wrouesnel> launching in 2D mode (i.e. software opengl), things work fine.
[06:24] <Sarvatt> well you said that before the last update, there was another not long before you asked, but there haven't been any big changes in a few updates so thats weird. might be kernel update related but i'm not sure which release you're on, 12.10 is the only one that gets big kernel updates
[06:24] <wrouesnel> I can confirm that "*ERROR* Invalid register 0x8040 in CS" is fixed by the kernel patch I linked, but I still get total display corruption / improperly working framebuffer drivers.
[06:24] <Sarvatt> ah so might be mesa related, gotcha
[06:24] <wrouesnel> also I was running the kernel from the ppa
[06:25] <wrouesnel> 3.7.0.7-15 I believe (I since downgraded everything from the ppa so I could have a usable system again).
[06:25] <Sarvatt> 3.8 will be in there very soon which should have any patch you might have linked in it
[06:26] <Sarvatt> best to stick with quantal kernels in the meantime
[06:26] <wrouesnel> yeah my own digging seemed to indicate that there's been a lot of development to radeon/drm that's slated for 3.8
[06:26] <Sarvatt> sorry about the trouble :(
[06:27] <wrouesnel> it's fine. I wouldn't run it if I wasn't looking for the learning exercise
[06:28] <wrouesnel> what i did discover is that apt hates downgrades, but is very happy to "upgrade" to a lower versioned number, which was how I eventually purged the ppa without apt trying to uninstall my entire system.
[06:28] <Sarvatt> http://people.canonical.com/~apw/3.8-rc2-raring/ is whats going in as soon as blobs get updated to work with it
[06:29] <Sarvatt> apt tried to screw you over even with xorg-edgers ppa-purge version? i uploaded one there that should be ok
[06:30] <Sarvatt> ppa-purge 0.2.8+bzr57+edgers1~quantal actually works here
[06:30] <wrouesnel> hm I may have missed that one. anyway, just pinning the quantal repos to highest priority worked perfectly for me.
