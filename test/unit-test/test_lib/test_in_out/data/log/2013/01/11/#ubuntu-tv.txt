[02:10] <bobweaver> So I am thinking about making a mythtv app for the phone.  just a little simple one and I was wondering what are the things that you use the most with myth ? also I am not sure if I should do 1 of 2 things.  1) if you are not on local how to get access to backend with out opening it up in router (port forwarding ect) 2)?  storage of the xml data base it self into a very small sqllight table is also a option for all the metadata and what n
[02:10] <bobweaver> ot.  This would make it have to call TVdb and TMDB stight and not the backend.  Just not sure how I would even pass a video like that
[02:10] <bobweaver> just wanted to get your thoughts on that
[02:14] <bobweaver> maybe if I make a ssh client in app that way one can ssh into box and forward ports for phone ?  I sure that there is a myth mobile already maybe this is a bad idea lol
