[00:00] <wgrant> maxb: Or was this to a different archive?
[00:01] <maxb> Cross archive, mercurial-ppa/staging-releases -> mercurial-ppa/releases
[00:01] <wgrant> Ah, right
[00:01] <maxb> the hardy item
[00:01] <wgrant> So it's not really a bug at all, you probably just didn't wait quite long enough;
[00:01] <wgrant> No invariant has been violated.

[00:11] <maxb> oH
[00:11] <maxb> I see why I was confused
[00:11] <maxb> The +listing-archive-extra expandy bit used to mention if some of the binaries were still unpublished
[00:11] <maxb> Apparently it no longer does
[00:20] <wgrant> maxb: It's meant to...

[18:13] <cqfd93> Hello All
[18:16] <cqfd93> I want to tell the devs that working on translations in Rosetta is REALLY REALLY PAINFUL!
[18:16] <cqfd93> LOTS OF TIMEOUT ERRORS and even worse PLEASE TRY AGAIN
[18:16] <cqfd93> that make you loose a complete page of 10 translations
[18:16] <cqfd93> and considerably slow down work
[18:18] <cqfd93> I'm working on the French translation of the DDTPs that have two huge templates, but the problem is now everywhere, even with small templates
[18:18] <cqfd93> I think we DO need a fix for that problem
[19:58] <Jacky> Is there any way to undelete this PPA?

[22:15] <shadeslayer> Hi, if it's not too much work, would it be possible to rescore these builds https://code.launchpad.net/~blue-shell/+archive/web-accounts/+build/4232281 , https://code.launchpad.net/~blue-shell/+archive/web-accounts/+build/4232282 , release critical builds I'm afraid :(
