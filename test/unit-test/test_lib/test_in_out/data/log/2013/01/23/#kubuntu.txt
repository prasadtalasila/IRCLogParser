[05:20] <ussher_> is there a way to turn flash off in firefox?  it crashes on almost every page.  sometimes freezing the system.  kubuntu 12.04 LTS.  works in konqueror, so dont want to remove it from the system completely.
[05:26] <jdrs> if i'm right there's a .mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so in your home folder. try to move the .so file out of the plugin directory
[05:37] <ussher_> cheers jdrs.  there is no .libflashplayer in that folder.  I found ADD ONS MANGER -> Shockwave Flash and disabled that from the firefox menu and it seams to have stopped crashing.
[05:37] <ussher_> thanks for the help
[07:03] <cjae> is kde 4.9 backported for 12.04 yet?

[14:33] <invariant> I didn't install a new kernel, so I don't see any reason for a reboot.

[15:26] <sorbanos> hi all
[15:27] <sorbanos> i have problem with adobe air i cannot install it from terminal
[15:27] <sorbanos> i'm using 64 bit Kubuntu 12.10
[15:28] <Guest22892> hi what is apt-get dist-upgrade?
[15:29] <sorbanos> Guest22892: with that command u can upgradde your system
[15:29] <EagleScreen> Guest22892: hello, it does a full upgrade of your packages
[15:29] <Guest22892> just installing all new packages?
[15:29] <Guest22892> i dont what to update the operating system!!!
[15:30] <EagleScreen> Guest22892: dist-upgrade installes new packages or remove packages if it is needed by some updates
[15:30] <Guest22892> ok
[15:30] <EagleScreen> Guest22892: you will keep in your actual operating system release
[15:30] <Guest22892> what happens if 1 package fails?
[15:30] <Guest22892> it reinstalls the old one?
[15:31] <EagleScreen> Guest22892: what kind of fail?
[15:31] <Guest22892> right know it told me i should use:
[15:31] <Guest22892> apt-get dist-upgrade -f
[15:31] <sorbanos> how can i install adobe air on kubuntu 12.10?
[15:33] <EagleScreen> Guest22892: -f option tries to fix broken packages (broken dependencies)
[15:36] <Guest22892> thats good?
[15:36] <EagleScreen> Guest22892: you will not usually want to use the -f option unless you know you have dependency issues with your instaled packages
[15:37] <Guest22892> it told me he cant upgrade without -f...
[15:37] <EagleScreen> who told you it? and why?
[15:37] <Guest22892> linux
[15:38] <EagleScreen> Guest22892: what kind of update re you doing?
[15:39] <Guest22892> apt-get update
[15:39] <Guest22892> apt-get dist-upgrade -f
[15:40] <EagleScreen> -f option is not usually needed
[15:41] <EagleScreen> you use apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade to do a regular software update as the same way you would do with the update manager in your desktop

[15:42] <sorbanos> anyone could help me with adobeair?
[15:43] <EagleScreen> sorbanos: what is adobeair?
[15:44] <ikonia> another adobe propritary visual plugin/application
[15:45] <sorbanos> it is used to create platform independent aplications
[15:45] <sorbanos> it comes as bin installer but in kubuntu 12.10 64bit i cannot run it
[15:45] <EagleScreen> sorbanos: are you application developper?
[15:46] <mr0wl> does anyone know how to have a consistent fingerprint for pidgin's OTR regardless of client?
[15:46] <sorbanos> when i'm using sudo ./AdobeAIRInstaller.bin i'm getting no such file or directory
[15:46] <sorbanos> EagleScreen: no i'm not i try install WiMP on my laptop and this app uses AIR
[15:47] <BluesKaj> sorbanos, what about pajamas .i read it was similar to adobe air
[15:47] <EagleScreen> sorbanos: and wat is WiMP?
[15:47] <BluesKaj> !pajamas | sorbanos
[15:48] <BluesKaj> err pyjamas
[15:48] <sorbanos> EagleScreen: a service similar to spotify
[15:49] <BluesKaj> !pyjamas | sorbanos
[15:49] <BluesKaj> odd
[15:49] <BluesKaj> it's listed in synaptic
[15:50] <sorbanos> i'm wondering why i cannot install it on kubuntu 12.10 64 on Ubuntu 12.10 64 it was working flawless
[15:50] <shadeslayer> !info pyjamas
[15:50] <ubottu> pyjamas (source: pyjamas): Python web widget toolkit and Python-to-Javascript compiler. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.7-1ubuntu1 (quantal), package size 1 kB, installed size 20 kB
[15:51] <EagleScreen> sorbanos: I remember using spotify on Linux
[15:51] <sorbanos> i don't need pyjamas,
[15:51] <BluesKaj> shadeslayer, what differntiates the factoid from the info factoid ?
[15:51] <sorbanos> EagleScreen: on Ubuntu 12.10 i've installed it without any problems
[15:52] <sorbanos> i'm wonder why on kubuntu i've got that error?
[15:52] <shadeslayer> BluesKaj: huh? !foo is a factoid and should be defined in ubottu, like !botsnack, !info foo is a factoid that fetches information about the package foo
[15:53] <EagleScreen> sorbanos: have you got any experience using linux terminal?
[15:54] <sorbanos> yes
[15:54] <sorbanos> EagleScreen: yes
[15:54] <BluesKaj> using Pyjamas Desktop (conceptually similar to Adobe AIR)
[16:01] <BluesKaj> sorbanos, my understanding is that adobe air dropped their linux support . Were you running an older verubuntu version before installing kubuntu 12.10?
[16:04] <sorbanos> BluesKaj: as i've posted i was using Ubuntu 12.10 also 64bit
[16:05] <BluesKaj> sorbanos, ok , poerhaps you need some gtklib dependencies

[16:41] <ovidiu-florin> is it safe to install Java7 from the official rpm package using alien?
[16:41] <ovidiu-florin> I don't have openjdk installed, and I'd preffer not to install it
[16:49] <yofel> ovidiu-florin: I can't say anything about alien, but considering how the java packages work that might end up going wrong. What I do is manually unpack the tar into /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle and then use this script to add the alternative configs:http://paste.kde.org/654752
[16:49] <yofel> with that even if you install openjdk it will still use oracle java
[16:49] <ovidiu-florin> I've been through that
[16:50] <ovidiu-florin> I was wondering if there's a better way
[16:50] <yofel> not that I know of, but I haven't tried to install the rpm package either
[17:06] <ovidiu-florin> yofel: the easyer way: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html
[17:06] <ovidiu-florin> it's recommended on the ubuntu help website

[19:00] <tion_> kde 3.5 was the best one yet the 4.x sucks
[19:00] <Pici> tion_: are you trying to upgrade from one version of Ubuntu to the next or just install the applications included with studio?
[19:00] <tion_> what ever works
[19:01] <Pici> tion_: It depends what you're trying to do.
[19:01] <tion_> my winXP is way faster that ubuntu
