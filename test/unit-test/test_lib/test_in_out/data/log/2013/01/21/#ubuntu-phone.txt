[04:04] <dangersalad> So what would be my best route for an app using local storage? Does the HTML5 local storage work? Is there some kind of SQL?
[04:05] <dangersalad> I am new to QT altogether, though I am familiar with C++ and well versed in JS
[04:11] <chriadam> using QML? http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/5.0/qtquick/qmlmodule-qtquick-localstorage2-qtquick-localstorage-2.html
[04:15] <dangersalad> OK, so I guess I have another question about QML{,Quick} and QT. Is QML the main target for the phone OS?
[04:16] <dangersalad> I had the impression that the QML was just for interface design with some light functionality

[04:16] <dangersalad> I guess I am just trying to find a good path to start with
[04:16] <chriadam> i don't know the answer to that, sorry
[04:22] <dangersalad> I guess I am having trouble finding what to move on to after the tutorial app from ubuntu's page.

[15:00] <voodootru> Hello, I see that Ubuntu Phone is finally supposed to be released in February? I was wondering if there is a beta or any way to try it out now?
[15:01]  * popey points voodootru at the /topic ☺
[15:01] <smartboyhw> voodootru, no:P
[15:01] <voodootru> cool, thanks guys. Guess I just have to sit tight :S
[15:36] <dangersalad> any reason openDatabaseSync would not be defined?
[15:37] <dangersalad> I am trying to use SQLite to save data

=== bearovercloud_ is now known as bearovercloud
[20:55] <zetheroo> wondering why the storage spec requirements for the Ubuntu Phone OS install is so high
[20:55] <popey> zetheroo: they are?
[20:56] <zetheroo> well for the "High-end Ubuntu "superphone"" it's 32GB
[20:56] <popey> that'll be normal by 2014
[20:57] <ajalkane> zetheroo: I guess it's because they intend to include the whole Ubuntu OS there for docking purposes.
[20:57] <zetheroo> of course if your installing numerous desktop applications you may need this kind of space ...
[20:57] <zetheroo> yeah, but even the full Ubuntu OS does not need anywhere near 32GB ...
[20:58] <zetheroo> does anyone know how much room Ubuntu Desktop actually takes on a HDD after a vanilla install?
[20:58] <ajalkane> zetheroo: of course not, but a buyer would be pretty disappointed buying a "superphone" where the OS takes most of the "available storage"
[20:58] <zetheroo> true
[20:59] <zetheroo> but I would imagine the actual install of Ubuntu would take up less than 4GB ... no?!
[21:00] <ajalkane> I'd imagnie so also... but thinking in powers of two, 16GB is the next lowest, and if the OS munches 4 gigs of that, it might not be a pleasant surprise. With 32 you'd still have 28 gigs left, so it's proportionally speaking less of an annoyance
[21:01] <zetheroo> ok, supposedly Ubuntu Desktop takes about 3GB and an additional 1.5GB is needed for updating etc ...
[21:02] <zetheroo> so in theory if one is not going to be installing dozens of desktop applications, 16GB could work pretty well ...
[21:02] <ajalkane> But really, we're talking about a "superphone" here. 32 gigs of storage place was not much even a year ago. Much less a year from now.
[21:02] <zetheroo> and actually Linux applications tend to be pretty lightweight as well ...
[21:02] <zetheroo> yeah true
[21:02] <ajalkane> Apps are not the only thing people want to use their phone for. The majority of content is what users want to store there. Videos, pictures etc.
[21:03] <zetheroo> yes - but if the phone has an SD slot you could store your media and data on there ... and leave the onboard memory for running the OS and apps ...
[21:03] <ajalkane> I somehow forgot music. I still see people lamenting how they can't store their whole music collection on a phone :)
[21:03] <zetheroo> I wonder if it will be possible to install the apps to SD
[21:03] <zetheroo> LOL
[21:04] <ajalkane> The specs say 32GB eMMC + SD, so apparently they don't care how the storage is provided
[21:04] <zetheroo> my need for this Ubuntu Phone OS is pretty straight forward with not much media or data storage ... basically just a tool for a sys admin
[21:05] <ajalkane> O guess all you need then is the "entry level Ubuntu smartphone" ;)
[21:05] <zetheroo> well I would not mind coming into work and docking my phone in and working on that :D
[21:06] <zetheroo> since I work with Ubuntu on a Thinkpad anyhow atm
[21:06] <zetheroo> would be pretty nifty to leave the laptop at home and just bring the "superphone" to work - hehe
[21:07] <ajalkane> Yeah, it does promise some sweet possibilities.
[21:07] <ajalkane> But we'll see how it materializes
[21:07] <zetheroo> it would be a shame to buy an expensive high-end phone and then find out that Ubuntu Phone is not ported to that model :P
[21:07] <zetheroo> I wonder how that will pan out ...
[21:12] <ajalkane> I'm not going to buy anything until real Ubuntu Phones (or Jolla phones) are out.
[21:13] <popey> me too ☺
[21:17] <ajalkane> I kept using my last phone (N95) for five years. I don't mind sitting on my ass for another 3-4 years if Ubuntu/Jolla takes their time, if there's nothing compellive in the market.
[21:18] <k1l_> i want an ubuntu-phone now! :)
[21:18] <ajalkane> Hehe... well me too
[21:19] <popey> I loved my N82
[21:19] <k1l_> honestly, im looking out for a cheap gnex on ebay to give it to my girlfriend. but i think im gonna need it for maintainance at end of february ;p
[21:21] <ajalkane> I have no experience of N82, but N95 was the first smartphone I wanted to BUY. It was just perfect for its time. I wasn't interested in buying a smartphone after that until N9 came. Now I'm not interested until Ubuntu/Jolla comes out with something :).
[21:23] <k1l_> i was very satisfied with the motorola milestone (the european droid). but it was to slow, had to less ram and the locked bootloader was a real showstopper. but i miss the hardware keyboard :/
