[07:38] <ubottu> cfhowlett called the ops in #ubuntu (THEBILL)
[07:40] <bkerensa> Same person coming in on polish dsl and spamming/trolling
[07:41] <bkerensa> looks like they are resetting their modem to get a slightly different hostmask
[07:54] <elky> since when do people need to startx to install ubuntu?
[08:00] <IdleOne> you don't
[08:00] <elky> see burntreynolds in #u then
[08:04] <IdleOne> I'm going to guess a bad burn or he burnt a server.iso
[08:14] <IdleOne> elky: problem is they are running backtrack
[08:14] <IdleOne> or trying to
[08:15] <elky> yeah, i figured. was eating dinner though ;)
[08:19] <IdleOne> not inclined to help them at all
[08:33] <bkerensa> I believe Mongolski is the same guy
[08:33] <bkerensa> watching him
[08:52] <Myrtti> bkerensa: polish school
[08:52] <Myrtti> I assume
[08:52] <Myrtti> computer class or student using one
[08:53] <Tm_T> IRC, Poland, can I has memoriez?
[08:54] <Myrtti> indeed
[08:56] <bkerensa> Poland does not seem like a place I would be keen on visiting
[08:56] <bkerensa> :D
[08:57] <Tm_T> bkerensa: why not? there's plenty of nice IRC users atleast.
[08:57] <bkerensa> Tm_T: The only things I know about Poland unfortunately come from Hollywood narrations of WWII
[08:57] <bkerensa> So
[08:59] <bkerensa> Very cold = Does not sound fun
[09:00] <IdleOne> any place that incented perogi is alright by me
[09:00] <IdleOne> invented also
[09:01] <Tm_T> bkerensa: Poland cold? wut?
[09:01] <bkerensa> IdleOne: Did Poland create it? It looks like Gyoza to me
[09:02] <bkerensa> :P
[09:02] <Tm_T> "Winters are rather cold, with average temperatures around 3 °C (37.4 °F) in the northwest and −6 °C (21 °F) in the northeast. " ... how that is cold by any meters, I wonder
[09:02] <IdleOne> Gyoza?
[09:02] <IdleOne> -6c is not cold
[09:02] <bkerensa> Gyoza/Jiǎozi = Dough Dumpling with Filling
[09:03] <bkerensa> looks just like a Perogi but Chinese have been making it since before Poland existed ;)
[09:03] <IdleOne> currently -13c here and it is rather warm
[09:03] <bkerensa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jiaozi!.jpg
[09:03] <IdleOne> bkerensa: I like Chinese food also :)
[09:04] <bkerensa> Me too... I like Japanese better though :) nothing like some good Nigiri or Sashimi
[09:04] <Tm_T> IdleOne: around that here too
[09:05] <bkerensa> Tm_T: its only 30F here and I feel like imminent doom is here
[09:06] <IdleOne> you pacific coast people are not from strong stock
[09:06] <IdleOne> The trees, maybe
[09:07]  * IdleOne hugs bkerensa and steals his Gyoza
[09:11] <bkerensa> IdleOne: Do you have your tattoo touched up at all anymore? I'm going to get some more orange and black added I think
[09:12] <IdleOne> bkerensa: I haven't had it touched up at all.
[09:13] <IdleOne> not to mention the artist who did it is 600 miles away but I haven't needed it touched since it was done.
[09:13] <bkerensa> :D
[09:13] <IdleOne> lighter colours will tend to bleed more
[09:14] <bkerensa> I'm getting a Tux in the Summer likely
[09:14] <IdleOne> I was worried about the green but it's been 5 years and it is still bright
[09:14] <bkerensa> :D
[09:14] <IdleOne> I don't like penguins that much :)
[09:15] <IdleOne> next tattoo I get will be a cover up on my right shoulder.
[09:16] <bkerensa> Someone from Redhat said if I ever switch to Fedora/RH they would pay to remove the Ubuntu :P
[09:17] <IdleOne> I am thinking of getting the nicks of all my favorite Ubuntu ops :P
[09:17] <bkerensa> lol
[09:18] <IdleOne> For the log readers, there is also room for those of you who wish to buy space, $5USD per letter
[09:19] <bkerensa> psh :)
[09:20] <bkerensa> IdleOne: http://www.steveo.com/gallery/pictures/tattoos/big/14.jpg
[09:20] <IdleOne> yeah, he got a tattoo of himself
[09:20] <bkerensa> crazy
[09:21] <IdleOne> dumbest tattoo ever
[09:21] <IdleOne> hmm, could have been worse.
[11:38] <AlanBell> Robbilie: hi, whats up Robbilie?
[15:10] <bazhang> lubuntu has a PPC install?
[15:11]  * Pici shrugs
[15:14] <bazhang> bios? there's no bios in a powerbook
[15:20] <bazhang> hahaha "a bash script"
[18:37] <Corey> Er, disregard.
[19:01] <jrib> hexabit_M: hi.  The bot should be okay as long as it does not speak (publicly or privately) in response to activity in the channel
[19:02] <hexabit_M> Hi. Ok no its just like a client but one can not use it to send text yet. :)
[19:03] <DJones> It sounds a very interesting project
[19:03] <jrib> hexabit_M: great.  You can ask #freenode if there's anything they would like you to do about the bot being on the network (for example you can get a cloak indicating it's a bot)
[19:03] <Fuchs> from our pov bots are allowed as long as they don't disrubt the network, nothing special is needed, a bot cloak can be granted if both the bot and owner confirm. </freenode>
[19:04] <DJones> JUst for clarity and so other ops know what the bot is doing, this was hexabit_M's original message in #u "Helo from Sweden! I coded a ircclient (like a bot) for blind people that reads all msgs out loud in  speakers. Would it be ok to test it for a couple of days in this channel?
[19:04] <jrib> hexabit_M: seems like it should be fine in #ubuntu then.  Good luck with your project
[19:05] <hexabit_M> Ok i will do that. Thanks again for your help. I will show you the source etc later. :)
