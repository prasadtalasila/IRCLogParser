[17:46] <czajkowski> whoo I have a date for the first hackntalk event I want to run in London :D
[17:53] <czajkowski> popey: AlanBell ^^
[18:56] <AlanBell> yay czajkowski \o/
[20:50] <bkerensa> huh new ubuntu audiocast is out.... https://soundcloud.com/ubuntu-audiocast/ubuntu-audiocast-episode-04
[20:52] <czajkowski> is an audiocast the same thing as a podcast
[20:53] <bkerensa> I imagine... I had never heard of the phrase audiocast until this show surfaced
[20:53] <bkerensa> its kind of weird because nobody seems to know who is making it
[20:54] <pleia2> I do, let me dig up
[20:55] <pleia2> we had a bit of a chat after they released the "Ubuntu Gangnam Style" thing which was not cool
[20:56] <pleia2> Chuck, Bucky, and Philbare of the Ubuntu Vancouver LoCo
[20:58] <pleia2> the announcement for their first also mentioned it was the vancouver loco: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-ca/2012-September/009664.html
[20:59] <bkerensa> pleia2: ah
[20:59] <pleia2> and they don't think they are a "podcast" because of the association of the term with ipods https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-news-team/2012-September/001636.html
[20:59] <pleia2> (spent a nice chunk of one of their first explaining this)
[21:00] <pleia2> prompted us to rename our "featured podcasts and video" section of UWN ot "featured audio and video" which was a good change I think :)
[21:01] <bkerensa> yeah
[21:02] <bkerensa> Huh I wonder if the Ubuntu UK Podcast folks know that :)
[21:02] <pleia2> ohio has a podcast too
[21:02] <bkerensa> :D
[21:03] <bkerensa> pleia2: it seems most nix media players call them podcasts too
[21:03] <pleia2> yep, and most non-ipod mp3 players too
[21:09] <czajkowski> the rest of the world calls em podcasts :)
[21:10] <popey> oh jeez
[21:11] <popey> what gets me is the hypocricy. "thou shalt not call it podcast" but "we'll distribute using non-free website and deliver via _flash_".
[21:11] <czajkowski> LOL
[21:11] <czajkowski> hmm I have chocolate wash stuff, this smells odd and yet nice
[21:11] <czajkowski> very confused
[21:12] <pleia2> if anyone has time to listen, I would be interested to know how it is content-wise for consideration for UWN (doesn't need to be professional quality, just reasonable and CoC-friendly)
