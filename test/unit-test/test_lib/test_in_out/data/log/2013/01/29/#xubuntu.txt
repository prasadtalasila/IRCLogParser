[00:33] <frojnd> Hi there.
[00:34] <frojnd> I don't know how to disable notifications
[00:34] <frojnd> Or at least limit them to like 1second of a time and then make em dissapear
[00:35] <frojnd> I'm running xubuntu 12.4 can someone please point me to right direction so I can resolve this issue?
[00:35] <frojnd> By notifications I mean the one when I change performance of the CPU with jupiter and then I see notification about changed mode
[00:36] <frojnd> any help appriciated
[01:08] <frojnd> Watt :) noone here?
[01:09] <Zelouille> frojnd: Setting manager > Notifications
[01:18] <Zelouille> frojnd: personally, i've replaced the xfce4-notifyd by notify-osd. They fade-out when the cursor is over them.
[01:22] <frojnd> Zelouille: thank you
[01:32] <Zelouille> frojnd: you could probably remove "xfce4-notifyd" in order to disable completely the notifications. But I don't know if it's perfectly clean to do it that way.

[08:20] <nikolam> so, 12.10 won't install on anything less then 4.3GB? It refuses install on eeePC 4G
[08:21] <nikolam> since there is no more alternate text install cd.
[08:21] <nikolam> I tried installing 12.04 before and adding GUI. It did not have desired results on wireless and network I think

[09:12] <Guido1> Hello, i'm trying to start a playlist in rhythmbox with cron, but i get stuk at the part telling where it is located. it's located in the home directory
[09:25] <nlsthzn> o/ quick question, xfce 4.10 will be backported to xubuntu 12.04 or better to use alternative PPA?
[09:31] <Unit193> nlsthzn: Pretty sure the options are to upgrade dists, or PPA.
[09:35] <nlsthzn> Unit193, don't want to upgrade to 12.10... was thinking on sticking with the lts...
[09:35] <nlsthzn> but there are ppa's so not a biggie
[09:36] <nlsthzn> thanks
[09:37] <Unit193> Sure.
[09:56] <ochosi> nlsthzn: i'm also pretty sure it won't be backported to 12.04, so the ppa is your only option

[14:56] <timm> hello, is there a way i can listen to my music through my mic input?
[15:20] <freedomrun> timm, no
[15:20] <timm> hmm well on windows you can listen to your mic input. freedomrun
[15:24] <GridCube> i dont really know if you can easily do that freedomrun, you will probably need to remap your devices or something like that, i would go and ask to a channel like #jack they probably know
[15:26] <freedomrun> most people use output for that timm but if you have some possibility for that kind of swiching in your audio chip an even need to do that detect the hardware and experiment with drivers, and pulse audio or jack .. even I cannot advise you to do that
[15:27] <timm> oh okay. i was hoping for something simple but i guess there isnt
[15:27] <freedomrun> GridCube, got better answer timm :)

[16:13] <esph> I'm migrating an account from an old laptop to a new one and was wondering what other user/system settings I could move over besides those in the home folder (which is already moved). Any ideas?
[16:22] <ochosi> esph: there some stuff in /etc and some in /usr
[16:22] <ochosi> ofc if you installed stuff in /local then there too
[16:22] <esph> ochosi: any idea what I should look for?
[16:23] <ochosi> icons
[16:23] <ochosi> e.g.
[16:23] <ochosi> or themes
[16:23] <esph> stuff for the settings manager, for instance
[16:23] <ochosi> settings manager?
[16:23] <ochosi> no, i was thinking fstab etc
[16:23] <ochosi> maybe cron-jobs
[16:23] <ochosi> system-wide scripts that you set up
[16:24] <esph> ochosi: this is a family laptop, so it's mostly mundane stuff I'm looking for
[16:24] <ochosi> right
[16:24] <ochosi> then there prolly won't be too much you'll miss in / anyway
[16:25] <esph> I've just noticed that none of the system manager settings seem to have been kept
[16:25] <esph> So either the settings weren't compatible (migrated to newer version of xubuntu) or they aren't kept in /home dirs
[16:29] <ochosi> system manager settinsg? do you remember which one?
[16:29] <ochosi> (settings in general tend to reside in home in either ~/.config or .local or .$appname)
[16:31] <esph> ochosi: things like trackpad, keyboard, and desktop background
[16:31] <esph> although I've just had an idea
[16:32] <esph> I don't think I restarted the WM since I copied the home folder over
[16:34] <esph> ochosi: does the settings manager mess with settings in /etc for things like keyboard and trackpad?
[16:34] <ochosi> nope
[16:35] <esph> ok
[16:35] <ochosi> which versions of xfce were you using
[16:35] <ochosi> cause with xfce4.10 new mouse-settings were introduced
[16:35] <ochosi> so i'm not 100% sure all the old ones were migrated
[16:38] <esph> ochosi: what's an executable I can --version to find out? (the old laptop's screen is broken, so I can't use xfce4-about)
[16:38] <ochosi> e.g. xfce4-settings-manager --version
[16:39] <esph> ochosi: Requires X
[16:39] <ochosi> oh, i thought you had x running but no screen :)
[16:39] <esph> ochosi: I could, but I'd have to set up X11 forwarding
[16:40] <esph> I assume I could find out with apt or synaptic?
[16:40] <ochosi> no need to set up afaik, a simple -X when connecting should suffice
[16:40] <ochosi> yes
[16:40] <ochosi> apt-cache actually
[16:40] <ochosi> apt-cache policy $package
[16:40] <ochosi> e.g. sudo apt-cache policy xfce4
[16:41] <esph> don't need sudo, it seems
[16:41] <ochosi> yeah, you don't :)
[16:41] <ochosi> at least if you don't wanna search
[16:41] <esph> ochosi: 4.8.0.2 to 4.10
[16:42] <ochosi> right
[16:42] <ochosi> in that case it's possible that the mouse/pointer settings were lost in the migration process
[16:43] <esph> ok, good to know
[16:47] <esph> after restarting, the keyboard stuff is there, but not the desktop bg for some reason (and yeah, the trackpad didn't change either(
[16:47] <esph> )*
[16:50] <ochosi> maybe the background you set isn't there anymore?
[16:50] <ochosi> better look at ~/.xsession-errors if there's anything
[16:50] <ochosi> esph: anyway, gotta go now, better ask someone else ;)
[16:50] <esph> ochosi: ok, thanks for the help

[18:43] <Os_Maleus1> hi all together! can You tell me, where configurations for the network-manager are possible to find? which files could help me to de-bug my wifi-settings regarding a specific router? which should I work over or delete for that?
[18:54] <Os_Maleus1> baizon, bipolar? could You perhaps help me with that?
[18:55] <xubuntu283> no more buttons on the windows unable to start windows settings
[19:07] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: you could try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide
[19:10] <Os_Maleus1> recon_lap: I am having here an Ideapad U160 (built in Broadcom adapter). Xubuntu installed over more than 1.5 years ago. everything worked fine until the weekend, when I was taking my Dlink DIR-825 router to the working place. since that, I have no proper access to the router. other machines do not have this problem. no matter which OS.
[19:11] <Os_Maleus1> but to other networks, my netbook is connecting further without any problems.
[19:12] <Os_Maleus1> sometimes, in the list of the used/configured wifi-connections, my old configurations pop up, even I was deleting them earlier.
[19:13] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: interesting ;) you could try follow that guide i linked and ask if you get stuck
[19:19] <Os_Maleus1> recon_lap: if I am not connected to the internet, am not able to send out pings nor see a web-page, why should I check it? the adapter works. there is something about the DHCP-setting. the folder /var/lib/dhcp/ is empty (and if it was not, I have emptied it sometimes, meanwhile.
[19:21] <Os_Maleus1> if I am setting the settings for the connection manually in the way that I am giving manually an IP that is outside of the DHCP-range-reservation, I am having internet-access. but trying it with automatic IP-receiving from the router, it doesn't work out anymore.
[19:22] <Os_Maleus1> switching of the access-filtering via MAC doesn't change anything on this situation.
[19:30] <Os_Maleus1> determinin a specific channel nor changing that one is resulting in a solution for this problem.
[19:42] <Os_Maleus1> I found a sentence that is "If you can connect to the router, but can't get an IP address, it may be because you put the wrong WEP key in." this would describe my situation, if it would be WEP, what I am using. but I am using WPA2 and the passwords are copied&pasted.
[19:43] <holstein> dont use wep... disable encryption to test if you can
[19:43] <holstein> use wpa
[19:44] <holstein> remove what you can from the equations... connect directly to the router with a cable and see that you get an IP address, and connectivity... disable encryption, connect, test.. turn on wpa, connect test... connect to other access points... test
[19:45] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: try from a live CD with the same hardware
[19:45] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: go into the gui for the network manager and blow out the settings for the wifi access points.. the "remembered" ones
[19:46] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: restart the machine... completly shut it down and remove the battery even
[19:46] <Os_Maleus1> cable is no problem
[19:47] <Os_Maleus1> rebooting (either router or the notebook) doesn't bring any changes.
[19:47] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: if you can connect with other machines, you can stop messing with the router
[19:47] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: you can try a live CD on the hardware, and see that it connects
[19:47] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: that will tell you A. the hardware works, and B. its somthing to do with your config in the OS
[19:48] <Os_Maleus1> same condition with live-CD, if I remember right. ... was just trying some hours ago.
[19:48] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: i would confirm.. that is a very important test
[19:48] <Os_Maleus1> to other networks I can connect, too.
[19:49] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: but other machines can connect to that access point, correct?
[19:49] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: and how about with encryption turned off?
[19:50] <Os_Maleus1> I need to check the issue with the encryption.
[19:50] <Os_Maleus1> I can connect with this machine to other networks and other machines can connect to my router.
[19:51] <Os_Maleus1> it effects just the connection between my router and my netbook.
[19:51] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: it?
=== Lumpy is now known as Lump|AFK
[19:51] <Os_Maleus1> the issue.
[19:52] <holstein> Os_Maleus1: wep is suspicious,, and you shouldnt be using wep anyway
[19:52] <recon_lap> the issue?
[19:52] <Os_Maleus1> I have WPA2
[19:52] <Os_Maleus1> using WPA2
[19:53] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: if you can see your network but cannot login I'm guessing you got your password wrong
[19:54] <holstein> yeah.. i would just blow those out.. i would turn off encryption temporarly and test
[19:54] <Os_Maleus1> if using the clipboard for setting up the passwords?
[19:54] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: and cut an paste of password does not necessary work
[19:54] <holstein> yeah.. that can be it
[19:54] <Os_Maleus1> jep, I am giving it a trial.
[19:55] <Os_Maleus1> ?
[19:55] <Os_Maleus1> this is now new for me.
[19:55] <holstein> that can be it = using the clipboard can fail
[19:55] <Os_Maleus1> *surprised*
[19:57] <Os_Maleus1> would such depend from the application, I am pasting that in?
[19:57] <Os_Maleus1> I mean editor, browser, GUI-configuration?
[19:59] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: you can paste clear text into a password control , but you cannot cut from a password input. or at least you shouldn't be able to.
[20:01] <Os_Maleus1> no, I did it from the clear text.
[20:04] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: so check by disabling encryption on the router, you can also check the WPA2 setting while your there.
[20:04] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: are you sure you got the right password?
[20:23] <Os_Maleus> indeed. encryption.
[20:23] <Os_Maleus> and now? if I want to apply the WPA-encryption?
[20:24] <Os_Maleus> what could I change to make it work again?
[20:24] <Os_Maleus> You guys mean, it could be an issue of the password. that I was clipboard-ing it?
[20:25] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus: Yes, you should be able to see the correct password on the router, check that you using the correct one, and that you connecting to the correct network
[20:34] <daftwilliam> so i'm having a problem, is this the place to bring it up in open chat?
[20:35] <Os_Maleus> holstein, recon_lap: but the passwords seem in each case to fit. there is no mistake in those.
[20:39] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus: don't know what else to suggest, double check settings, paste the output of sudo ifup <interface name> , maybe give us some clues.
[20:39] <recon_lap>  
[20:45] <Os_Maleus1> Ignoring unknown interface eth1=eth1
[20:47] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: it the wireless interface you testing "wlan"
[20:47] <Os_Maleus1> yep.
[20:47] <Os_Maleus1> eth1
[20:47] <recon_lap> use ifconfig to see what interfaces you got
[20:47] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: "eth1" is a wired interface
[20:48] <Os_Maleus1> eth1, eth0 and 1o
[20:48] <Os_Maleus1> has always been in my case.
[20:49] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: seems your wireless card is not detected
[20:50] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: sry, just checked and I'm wrong about wlan
[20:53] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: paste the output of nm-tool
[20:59] <Os_Maleus1> http://pastebin.com/cX1fVvWV
[21:00] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: thats connected ?? State: connected (global)
[21:00] <Os_Maleus1> right now it is. otherwise, I would not be able to chat with You.
[21:01] <Os_Maleus1> but it is connected with manual settings.
[21:01] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: so what setting do you change ?
[21:02] <Os_Maleus1> I mean, IP above the DHCP-range of the settings of the router.
[21:02] <Os_Maleus1> but it should connect within the DHCP-range.
[21:03] <Os_Maleus1> so, that I could make a port-forwarding, e.g..
[21:04] <Os_Maleus1> for that, I would need a steady IP. but I can not make it directly from the router. a week ago, before I was taking the router with to my working place, it was working.
[21:05] <Os_Maleus1> and there, I didn't change a thing on the settings of neither the router nor the netbook.
[21:08] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: so using "IPv4 settings -> Automatic" won't connect?  but if you give it an IP it does?
[21:09] <Os_Maleus1> tail -f /var/syslog is showing that the authentication is being finished. only an IP I do not receive.
[21:10] <Os_Maleus1> is a local domain name having to do something with that? but for manual settings, I am not making any kind of notes regarding such either.
[21:11] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus1: and your router is using DHCP ?
[21:14] <Os_Maleus> yes, it does. ... usually. but not at the moment, because, I won't receive an IP. for all other PCs at my home, it works out without any trouble.
[21:17] <recon_lap> Os_Maleus: reboot the modem maybe, but I'm out of ideas.
[21:18] <Os_Maleus> sadly no, that doesn't help either. I was even trying to let it unplugged over hours. no chance. :-(
[21:18] <Os_Maleus> but thank You really very much for Your kind help, recon_lap!

[22:59] <heraclitis> Is this command sufficient to create a backup image of a hard drive? "dd if=/dev/SOURCE of=/dev/Destination.img?
[23:00] <heraclitis> My goal is to experiment all I want, and if I mess something up, I want to be able to burn the image back to the hard drive.
[23:01] <torax> that will make a bit-by-bit copy of the _whole_ hard drive, if you have 1TB drive it will make 1TB file
[23:03] <heraclitis> It's only 80 gb, so I'm not too concerned about size. But I'd be able to burn the image back to the drive? Would I have to format the drive first, then use the command in reverse?
[23:03] <heraclitis> Also, would md5sum give me a reliable indication of integrity?
[23:04] <torax> I use clonezilla to take full disk backups, but i dont see why that would not work also
[23:05] <heraclitis> Cool. Is clonezilla a mozilla product?
[23:05] <torax> nope

[23:34] <ochosi> if you haven't spent too much time on it, a clean install might be worth thinking about
[23:35] <freedomrun> nah I did purge them mostly infact all there are just conflicting references like it is visible from .xsession-errors like oxygen-gtk engine reference
