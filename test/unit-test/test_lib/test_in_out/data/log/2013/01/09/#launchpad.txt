[04:49] <stewart> hi! How come people who are not bug supervisor can change data about bugs? (e.g. assignment) ?
[04:50] <wgrant> They can assign themselves or their teams so that the community can help fix bugs, but they cannot (un)assign others. Users tend to be fairly well behaved and not abuse this, and if they do then we make them stop :)
[04:57] <stewart> wgrant, we had https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/+bug/1017192/+activity assigned away from someone not in any of the bug supervisor or project owners group
[04:57] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1017192 in Percona Server 5.5 "Server crashes in add_identifier on concurrent ALTER TABLE and SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS" [Critical,Fix committed]
[04:58] <stewart> wgrant, 2013-01-09 03:34:22 entry on page above.
[04:59] <wgrant> Ah, it seems we don't restrict unassignment, just assignment
[05:00] <stewart> wgrant, so probably unassignment then assignment appears as changing assignment.
[05:01] <wgrant> Right, but I mean we don't have a guard preventing someone from changing the assignee away from some other person
[05:02] <stewart> wgrant, it'd be good if there was :) at least for the case where it's assigned to one of the people in the project :)
[05:04] <stewart> wgrant, also, am being told that outsiders can change bug status.
[05:06] <wgrant> Sure, outsiders can use some bug statuses, assign themselves or their teams, mark bugs as duplicates, comment, manage attachments, that sort of thing. They can't set it to or from Won't Fix, set it away from Fix Released, change the importance at all, or assign others.
[05:10] <stewart> wgrant, it seems strange that they'd be able to change from Invalid to Confirmed though (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/+bug/1007164/+activity )
[05:10] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1007164 in Percona Server 5.5 "SSL connection error: protocol version mismatch" [Undecided,New]
[05:13] <wgrant> stewart: Not hugely strange. The benefits of users being able to reopen prematurely closed bugs have historically outweighed the downsides of users occasionally inappropriately reopening them.
[05:14] <wgrant> Occasionally someone will do something inappropriate, but then we talk to them and they never do it again. If they do it again, we ban them :)
[05:15] <wgrant> It usually works out pretty well, and avoids the mess you often see in bugtrackers where outsiders have to poke the core team just to make a status change when the status change is clearly correct
[05:15] <wgrant> We assume good faith, and it's usually better than the alternative
[06:34] <lifeless> the current permissions were arrived at organically
[06:34] <lifeless> start with assume good faith
[06:34] <lifeless> observe the egregious failures and lock those and only those down
[06:37] <wgrant> Right :)
[06:44] <stewart> lifeless, wgrant: it's not a huge problem for us, but the ability for others to reassign (rather than go from nobody assigned to assign them) was certainly a surprise

[07:21] <YoBoY> Hi
[07:23] <YoBoY> stupid question : There is a way to have the same contact email adresse for two teams on launchpad?
[07:23] <wgrant> No, team/user email addresses must be unique
[07:28] <lifeless> you can make both teams part of a super team
[07:28] <lifeless> give the super team the email address.
[07:38] <czajkowski> morning
[07:48] <lifeless> morning czajkowski, stub
[07:48] <stub> yo
[07:50] <YoBoY> lifeless, well that's an idea, but in the team pages, the contact email is still not the one I want ;)
[07:50] <YoBoY> thanks wgrant and lifeless, I'll go with different aliases to solve this :p
[07:50] <czajkowski> it's too early to be reading email
[07:50] <czajkowski> *yawns*
[07:50] <YoBoY> good morning czajkowski :)
[07:50] <czajkowski> ello YoBoY

[23:52] <adam_g> hi- running into issues branching a specific remote branch. i've tried differnet transports and different bzr versions, but seems impossible for me to branch it: bzr: ERROR: Not a branch: "bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-cloud-archive/ubuntu/precise/cinder/folsom/": location is a repository.
[23:52] <adam_g> any hints?
[23:55] <wgrant> adam_g: The statement is accurate; there's no actual branch there, just a repository.
[23:55] <wgrant> Someone apparently removed the branch
[23:55] <wgrant> There should be a 'branch' directory at http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-cloud-archive/ubuntu/precise/cinder/folsom/.bzr/
[23:56] <wgrant> You should probably talk to whoever might have touched that last to see if they have a copy that they can push, otherwise you could try to recover it manually
