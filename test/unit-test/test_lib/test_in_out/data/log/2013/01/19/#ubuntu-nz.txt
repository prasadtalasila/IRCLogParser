[00:18] <Atamira> eeep
[00:24] <ibeardslee> I've considered a siren in my PC case .. I'd seriously want to cause problems to someone who thought my PC/home servers would be better at their place.
[00:25] <G> actually, it'd be a good one to stop the cat jumping on mine
[20:26] <olly> morning
[20:31] <ibeardslee> morning snail .. how's life?
[20:50] <lifeless> o/
[21:01] <ibeardslee> sigh .. started considering starting the conversion of my PCinto my homeserver (to get rid of the VIA C3 jobbie) .. but then started thinking I have 4 disks .. what if I want to upgrade? I don't want a full on PC sucking power
[21:02] <ibeardslee> what if I also managed to get a freeview capable card?
[21:02] <ibeardslee> a friggin' rabbit hole
[21:09] <lifeless> ibeardslee: lol
[21:09] <lifeless> ibeardslee: see my chat with G for the conclusion of that rabbit hole
[21:19] <ibeardslee> 'a conclusion' to the rabbit hole
[21:24] <ibeardslee> a lot of the reason to use what is my PC as a server disappeared when I got the well powered UltraLap .. don't really need it for dev/play VMs
[21:29] <lifeless> right
[21:30] <lifeless> with portable compute power so large
[21:30] <lifeless> fixed stuff has to be either super large, or disk storage :)
[21:30] <ibeardslee> I suppose ulimately I am after a decent ARM board with GB network and the ablity to deal with at least 4 sata disks
[21:31] <lifeless> what was that dev server unit again
[21:31] <ibeardslee> as storage and minimal network services (dhcp, dns, mail, irc client)
[21:32] <ibeardslee> the PC? an AMD 64 X2
[21:32] <lifeless> no, there is a little server unit
[21:33] <ibeardslee> that intel NUC thing?
[21:33] <lifeless> no :)
[21:34] <lifeless> I'm just failing at googling it for you
[21:34] <lifeless> its a little arm unit, like the nuc, but arm.
[21:34] <ibeardslee> for a while I had looked at the HP N40L
[21:37] <lifeless> ibeardslee: http://trimslice.com/web/
[21:38] <lifeless> man they fail at being googlable without the name
[21:41] <ibeardslee> if they could do better storage options
[21:42] <lifeless> yeah
[21:42] <lifeless> didn't remember the no-esata thing
[21:42] <lifeless> does have sata though
[21:43] <ibeardslee> single 2.5"
[21:44] <lifeless> ibeardslee: looks like http://www.fit-pc.com/web/fit-pc/fit-pc3-info/#techinfo has 2xesata
[21:44] <lifeless> (linked from the trim-fit)
[21:51] <lifeless> ibeardslee: http://www.fit-pc.com/fit-pc3/docs/fit-PC3-block-diagram.jpg looks like it might match your needs, though it isn't arm
[21:51] <ibeardslee> hmm seems you can get drive enclosures that plug into a sata port
[21:52] <lifeless> ibeardslee: I have an icydock 4 bay w/esata that I'm pretty happy with
[21:52] <lifeless> sourced locally, let me dig up a ref
[21:52] <lifeless> http://www.icydock.com/goods.php?id=33
[21:53] <ibeardslee> looking at those on ascent
[21:54] <ibeardslee> so could be away without the multiple sata ports onboard
[21:54] <lifeless> http://www.computerstore.co.nz/MB561US-4SB-1.aspx
[21:55] <lifeless> is the actual place I got mine, FWIW
[21:55] <lifeless> it handles 3TB drives fine
[21:58] <ibeardslee> hmm no those sata-sata devices aren't actually a single sata connection :(
[22:01] <ibeardslee> ok .. now to start looking for an arm board with an esata port
[22:09] <lifeless> technically you want esata with/port multiplier support
[22:12] <ibeardslee> oh .. you can get a sheevaplug with esata
[22:24] <lifeless> !!!
[22:24]  * ibeardslee backs away from more rabbit holes
