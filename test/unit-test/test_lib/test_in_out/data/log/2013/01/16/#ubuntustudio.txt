[02:59] <cfhowlett> FYI ... http://www.ubuntuphotographer.com/
[03:21] <LaRueGT> are there any other fm synth options out there aside from hexter?
[05:02] <jbermudes> Would something like this work with Ubuntu Studio? www.amazon.com/M-Audio-US41750-Audiophile-Hi-def-Card/dp/B00064ABSG/
[05:04] <holstein> jbermudes: should
[05:04] <holstein> ive heard good things about that card
[05:04] <holstein> i know, you wont see anything from maudio in a professional stuio
[05:04] <holstein> studio*
[05:05] <holstein> depending on your needs, i think it would be a good value if you get it cheap
[05:05] <holstein> jbermudes: i saw them for like $40 us used
[05:05] <jbermudes> holstein: I want to record some video footage and 3 audio sources and have the 3 audio sources be 3 separate audio tracks for the video. Will this card help me do that?
[05:06] <holstein> jbermudes: its 2 channels
[05:06] <holstein> jbermudes: you likely want 3 stereo sources. so 6 tracks
[05:06] <holstein> thats not trivial
[05:06] <holstein> not easy for a system to handle either. though i do that routinely with my firepod
[05:06] <holstein> the presonus firepod is a good value for 8 analog inputs
[05:07] <holstein> that gets into the headache of firewire though.. and you dont need that
[05:07] <jbermudes> What if I don't care about stereo audio? (These are sourcing from 3 headset microphones)
[05:07] <holstein> you could use something USB with 6 ins
[05:07] <holstein> jbermudes: you dont hae to "care" about it.. if you want 3 sources that are stereo, thats 3 channels
[05:07] <holstein> if you want only 3 mono sources, that card you link does 2
[05:08] <holstein> if i wanted to do what you are doing, i would get a mixer, and just use what i have til i see what i need
[05:08] <jbermudes> But doesn't the mixer mix it down into 1 combined audio track?
[05:09] <holstein> yup.. you'll mix it to 2 tracks.. a stereo track... on the way in
[05:09] <jbermudes> I need to preserve each microphone as a separate track so that the video file can have different audio tracks, like the way a DVD has multiple languages
[05:10] <holstein> jbermudes: microphones?
[05:10] <holstein> jbermudes: you'll need preamps then
[05:10] <holstein> you need something with 3 preamps.. for mics
[05:10] <holstein> my firepod has 8
[05:10] <holstein> there are 4 channel interfaces for USB
[05:10] <holstein> jbermudes: what you linked has no preamps
[05:12] <holstein> http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/alesis-io4-4-channel-24-bit-recording-interface
[05:12] <holstein> ^^ i dont know about the linux support for that.. but it would do what you are looking for
[05:12] <holstein> http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/m-audio-fast-track-ultra-usb-2.0-audio-interface
[05:12] <holstein> ^ i have heard that works with linux
[05:13] <holstein> http://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main is where the supported cards are listed
[05:13] <holstein> jbermudes: try and keep in mind the budget and the team and the gear that movies use
[05:14] <holstein> try and emulate that workflow as best you can
[05:14] <holstein> im not saying you have to spend a coupld grand, but you can use some appropriate gear that you find at a good value
[05:14] <holstein> http://www.ffado.org/ for the firewire devices
[05:15] <holstein> jbermudes: im out.. i gotta get up early.. check #opensourcemusicians if its slow in here.. cheers..
[05:15] <jbermudes> holstein: Thanks again!
[13:56] <shirubio> hola
[13:57] <smartboyhw> Hello shirubio

[14:04] <smartboyhw> Yes
[15:57] <mighty_aboba> Hi everyone
[15:57] <mighty_aboba> Does someone know how can I block/ignore Midi time clock events with alsa?
[15:57] <mighty_aboba> from my midi keyboard
[16:17] <studio-user228> this web IRC window was opened during my installation of 12.10
[16:18] <studio-user228> some months ago i tried 12.04
[16:19] <studio-user228> sometimes the system just freeze itself
[16:20] <studio-user228> if i left it there doing nothing, it survives a day without crash
[16:21] <studio-user228> but it randomly crashed from time to time when performing cpu intensive tasks
[16:22] <studio-user228> it's not a memory or cpu failure, since that is not a problem when running windows on the same machine.
[16:24] <studio-user228> so now i wanna know if the problem is solved with 12.10 or not
[16:25] <studio-user228> i m now installing it onto a usb harddrive
[16:28] <studio-user228> i m new to linux, 6 months if you wonder. could anybody tell me what will happen when executing an application with memory less than enough and without swap?
[16:29] <studio-user228> in windows i will be notified 'not enough memory'
[16:29] <studio-user228> or appcrash
[16:31] <studio-user228> there should be no chance an appcrash kills the OS, just wondering what would be the cause for my bad experience with ubuntustudio1204
[16:32] <studio-user228> well the installation is done, gonna reboot
[16:32] <studio-user228> wish me good luck
[16:33] <studio-user228> during 16 minutes i didn't see any reply, maybe it's a connection problem?
[17:28] <zequence> mighty_aboba: Probably you need to configure your keyboard to not send it
