[14:34] <gary_poster> frankban, juju-ui?
[14:34] <frankban> gary_poster: ok
[15:15] <therve> hazmat, around?
[15:15] <hazmat> therve, yes
[15:15] <hazmat> therve, what's up
[15:15] <therve> hazmat, do you have some time for questions? there is still one piece of the puzzle I'm missing
[15:20] <hazmat> therve, in 1m for 10m yes
[15:20] <therve> ok :)
[15:22] <hazmat> therve, https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/578ca1fef07eca8375038c223c90d5cdb2667c70?authuser=0&hl=en
[15:27] <gary_poster> Makyo, on call but could you try tests on trunk, make test-debug?  I think there is a test failure that you could identify quickly
[15:27] <Makyo> gary_poster, sure thing.
[15:27] <gary_poster> ty Makyo 
[15:30] <Makyo> gary_poster, Weird.  Alright, looking into it.
[15:34] <bac> gary_poster: hanging out?
[15:34] <gary_poster> bac, y
[15:44] <bac> gary_poster: are you attempting to join?
[15:44] <hazmat> gary_poster, ping hangout
[15:44] <gary_poster> bac, hazmat, coming
[15:53] <bac> teknico: i've gotten complaints lately that my audio is not understandable due to choppiness so i thought i'd try the low bandwidth for video.  hope it helped.
[15:54] <teknico> bac, I noticed no problems with your audio
[15:54] <hazmat> bac it did
[15:54] <bac> perhaps a static picture might be less annoying than the line drawing.
[15:54] <hazmat> bac but i normally don't have issues with your audio
[15:54] <hazmat> bac, for me without the low bandwidth, i wouldn't frequently get freeze ups and drops
[15:54] <hazmat> er.. would
[15:54] <bac> hazmat: how do you get service?  dsl?
[15:55] <teknico> and I'm always in favor of anything that helps correcting the gross imbalance between video and audio in contemporary media culture!
[15:55] <teknico> I don't find the solarized/line drawing video annoying at all anyway
[15:56] <teknico> bac, did you happen to try the low bandwidth option (the one without "ultra") too?
[15:56] <bac> teknico: not yet
[15:56] <teknico> and hazmat too ^^
[15:57] <hazmat> teknico, not yet
[18:17] <teknico> does -req lbox option work? on two attempts out of two I got:
[18:17] <teknico> error: Failed to send patch set to codereview: diff is empty
[18:17] <teknico> does *the -req...
[18:19] <teknico> and, can the merge proposals for two branches be linked to the same bug, in lbox?
[18:27] <teknico> resubmitted without prerequisite, unfortunately the diff will be much bigger than needed, until the first branch lands
[19:22] <bac> bcsaller: it looks like your latest merge broke one test.  have you seen that?
[19:23] <bcsaller> bac: no, what are you seeing?
[19:23] <bac> gary_poster, benji: could one of you review my branch in secondary?
[19:23] <benji> bac: sure
[19:24] <bac> bcsaller: must be able to add a relation from the control panel â€£
[19:24] <bac> expected '-58' to not equal '-58'
[19:24] <Makyo> bac, https://codereview.appspot.com/7102055/
[19:24] <bac> bcsaller: i haven't investigated, just noted that reverting to r313 does not show the problem
[19:25] <bac> Makyo: is that a review request?  i'd be glad to.
[19:25] <bac> Makyo: oh, that's the fix for the problem i just annoyed bcsaller about?
[19:25] <Makyo> bac, A branch that fixes that test.  If you'd be willing to see if that fixes i--yes :)
[19:25] <bcsaller> nice
[20:59] <gary_poster> bac benji and I approved thank you
[20:59] <bac> gary_poster: i saw.  thank you and benji
[20:59] <gary_poster> cool bac
[20:59] <bac> lbox submitting...
[21:00] <bac> followed closely by lbox dog -walk
[21:05] <bac> gary_poster: i just updated config-prod.js on uistage to have the user/passwd
[21:05] <bac> so in ten minutes the login should be disabled
[21:05] <gary_poster> thanks bac on call
[21:05] <bac> np
[21:10] <bac> cool, uistaging no longer prompts for password
[21:44] <benji> gary_poster: (no rush) so, what is the most kanban-y thing to do with the 1090716 card?
[21:44] <gary_poster> benji sorry on call till 5
[21:47] <hazmat> therve, env uuid branch just about ready for review (though finding a reviewer might be tough)
[21:48] <hazmat> twill need a follow up to also make it available off the ws
[21:56] <hazmat> therve, if your up for a review its at https://codereview.appspot.com/7092055
[22:14] <gary_poster> benji now off call, and rushing to next thing.  um. I think the most accurate/historically informative representation will be to keep it active somehow.  Back to coding would be fine.
[22:36] <benji> gary_poster: will do
