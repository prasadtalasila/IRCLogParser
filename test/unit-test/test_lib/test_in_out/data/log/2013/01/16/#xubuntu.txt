[17:02] <xubuntu378> Hi
[17:02] <xubuntu378> i have a problem with parole
[17:02] <xubuntu378> could anybody help me?
[17:04] <baizon> !ask | xubuntu378
[17:04] <ubottu> xubuntu378: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[17:06] <xubuntu378> Parole gives me that error when i open a video "Gstreamer backend error Configured videosink video is not working" ; i have al the gstreamer librarys
[17:21] <xubuntu378> (parole:7630): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: /build/buildd/glib2.0-2.32.3/./gobject/gsignal.c:2572: instance `0xb244f1c0' has no handler with id `464'
[17:35] <Pezikrypt> I currently have my XUbuntu-64bit Virtualization OS running via VMPlayer, and I have the network running via NAT. I want to give the VM it's own IP, and so I would do bridged-mode, but it isn't working. The network connection is via Wifi.
[17:35] <Pezikrypt> Any thoughts on to how to get Bridged-Mode working? The Host OS is Windows 7.
[17:47] <TheSheep> Pezikrypt: I think you need to refer to the host's operating system documentation
[17:47] <TheSheep> Pezikrypt: nothing special to do in the vm itself
[17:50] <Pezikrypt> No, I need to extract the Virtual Network Editor from VMWorkstation 9.
[17:51] <TheSheep> whatever you need to do, you don't do it in xubuntu, so we can't help you there
[17:51] <Pezikrypt> Yeah.. :/

[22:33] <xubuntu789> Hi, have been Xubuntu for a a week or so now and a few things have become apparent, sometimes I'm writing and all of a sudden text will start appearing in an unitended part of the document. Any idea why this is? it didn't happen with my original Mac operating system.
[22:35] <xubuntu789> Could it be that my native system was more forgiving of ageing hardware? could it be fixed by just getting a new keyboard?
[22:36] <TheSheep> xubuntu789: it's probably because you are touching your touchpad accidentally and clickig, thus moving your mouse cursor
[22:37] <TheSheep> xubuntu789: there is a daemon that can temporarily disable the touchpad while you are typing
[22:38] <xubuntu789> How do I sort this out?
[22:40] <xubuntu789> Sorry- just to explain I'm very new to this so Its sometimes difficult to ask the right question- I'm not even sure what Daemon is!
[22:41] <TheSheep> let me find a tutorial
[22:45] <Papa-Smurf> Hi
[22:45] <xubuntu789> Thanks
[22:46] <Papa-Smurf> Are all port closed by default with xubuntu?
[22:47] <torax> no
[22:48] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: you can easily check that with 'netstat -l'
[22:49] <TheSheep> xubuntu789: ok, so I didn't find a tutorial for the recent ubuntu, as ubuntu has it now build in, but the solution is to start the command 'syndaemon -i 1 -d' when you log in
[22:49] <TheSheep> xubuntu789: if you go to settings manager->startup and sessions
[22:49] <TheSheep> xubuntu789: then you can add that command there to be run automatically
[22:50] <TheSheep> xubuntu789: you can also test it in a terminal
[22:50] <TheSheep> the -i 1 tells it to enable touchpad 1 second after you stopped typing
[22:50] <TheSheep> you can tweak it to taste
[22:53] <xubuntu789> That's amazing- thank you for your help!
[22:53] <Papa-Smurf> TheSheep,  I am just listening through 22
[22:54] <Papa-Smurf> TheSheep but i want to listed in other ports
[22:55] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: then you need to start the right servers for those services
[22:56] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: what kind of services do you want to provide?
[22:56] <Papa-Smurf> TheSheep, start the right services?
[22:56] <Papa-Smurf> I want to open the ports to play WoW
[22:57] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: usually when you listen on a port, it's so that the other computers can connect to them and send or receive some data -- what kind of data depends on what kind of service you run
[22:57] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: so you can have a web server, for example, or an ssh server, or an ftp, or vnc, etc.
[23:00] <Papa-Smurf> TheSheep I need to use and app that uses the port 3724 for inbound/outbound connections
[23:00] <Papa-Smurf> *an
[23:02] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: you don't need to do anything special on your computer for that
[23:03] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: but if you are on a private network behind NAT, then you (or a network administrator) may need to forward that port to your computer on the router
[23:03] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: but that's not in any way specific to xubuntu or linux
[23:04] <Papa-Smurf> TheSheep, OK but i am in a private network who i am the network administrator
[23:04] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: then refer to your router's manual
[23:05] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: you can also try asking at ##networking
[23:05] <TheSheep> Papa-Smurf: be sure to specify the make and model of your router when you do
[23:06] <Papa-Smurf> TheSheep maybe is something of my ISP
[23:06] <TheSheep> that is also possible
[23:08] <Papa-Smurf> TheSheep thanks man
[23:08] <Papa-Smurf> I understood today that ports in linux
[23:08] <Papa-Smurf> only opens when a service is listening through that specific port
[23:09] <TheSheep> it's the same on windows, really, and all other operating system -- they share the same code for their network stacks
[23:09] <TheSheep> except that windows will have a lot of services already running by default
[23:10] <Papa-Smurf> i understand
[23:18] <Papa-Smurf> thanks TheSheep
[23:18] <Papa-Smurf> have a very nice day
[23:18] <Papa-Smurf> take care
[23:53] <xubuntu959> hello
