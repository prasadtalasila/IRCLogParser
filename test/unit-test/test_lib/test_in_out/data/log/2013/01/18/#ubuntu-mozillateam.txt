[10:55] <c10ud> hello there, any hint on bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/1097763 ?
[10:55] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1097763 in firefox (Ubuntu) "Firefox 18 anti-aliasing does not render correctly some text " [Undecided,Confirmed]
[10:58] <chrisccoulson> c10ud, try reporting it upstream?
[10:58] <chrisccoulson> we have a single person working on firefox in ubuntu (me), and i'm afraid i've already got plenty to do without working on a minor font issue that i can't even see on my monitor here
[10:59] <c10ud> well, minor, i wouldn't say it.. but still, if you think it's firefox fault and not ubuntu/debian's
[10:59] <c10ud> i can report it upstream, it's just noone answered :)
[10:59] <chrisccoulson> perhaps it's my eyes or screen, but i can't see any difference between https://launchpadlibrarian.net/128005874/firefox.png
[11:00] <chrisccoulson> and yes, it's minor, compared to thousands of other bugs that are open
[11:00] <c10ud> chrisccoulson, the last comment to that bug contains a better example
[11:01] <c10ud> chrisccoulson, also I'm not asking you to fix immediately, just asking for "hints": even report upstream is a valid hint, if you believe it's an upstream issue
