[05:53] <cje_> Hi, I would like to install Lubuntu to a CD, but my CDs are only 700 MB, and Xubuntu is 715 MB of ISO.  What should I do?
[05:53] <cje_> oops, I meant Lubuntu, not Xubuntu
[05:55] <holstein> cje_: same... USB stick or DVD
[05:56] <holstein> OR, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD ,get the minimal install image, burn that to CD, and add what you want/need

[06:31] <Mobil> it would just mount to /media/xxx
[09:50] <blaze_> hello
[09:50] <blaze_> anyone
[09:50] <blaze_> here
[11:02] <delldim> how can i change directory and access files from anopther partition, ek from sda1 to sda3 or to sdb1
[11:04] <orbitus> from the terminal?
[11:06] <delldim> yes
[11:06] <delldim> ;)
[11:07] <delldim> im using LXTerminal;)
[11:08] <orbitus> you mean like the command cd?
[11:08] <delldim> yes
[11:08] <delldim> or any command that can get me to view directories and access files
[11:08] <orbitus> ls to list the files within the directory
[11:11] <delldim> yes
[11:11] <delldim> but how to change to other partitions and view and access files
[11:12] <delldim> ls just gives me a list on the current partition
[11:12] <orbitus> try cd and then that directory
[11:13] <delldim> but i need to get to another partition
[11:13] <delldim> i cant do that with ls and cd
[11:16] <orbitus> like to go up a level
[11:18] <delldim> well get to sda1 to sda3 or sdb1 - if that is going up a level then yes
[11:18] <orbitus> can you see them in your file explorer?
[11:18] <delldim> yes
[11:19] <delldim> but its faster to use a command line actually
[11:20] <orbitus> well find the full link to it, something like /usr/sda1
[11:20] <delldim> ok and then i use cd?
[11:21] <orbitus> yeah, like cd /usr/sda1
[11:21] <delldim> ok thnx
[11:22] <orbitus> np, i think its /media that its in
[11:22] <delldim> ok:)
[11:26] <delldim> i have another question too. I once installed my bootloaders on the root sda/sdb but then one of the linux os'es disappeared from the grub menu and updating the grub didnt change it so i installed the bootloaders on separate partitions and then it worked. I read its best to install them on the root but how do i get that top work?
[11:31] <orbitus> from my experience it hasn't affected anything for me, as long as it works
[11:36] <delldim> hmm so how come it overwrites the previous grub menu items when installing it on the root sda/sdb?

[21:30] <roasted> Question - I installed Ubuntu 12.04 and then installed LXDE on top. I'm trying to set up automatic login, but even though I edited /etc/lxdm/default.conf to auto log in as me, it won't work. Eh?
