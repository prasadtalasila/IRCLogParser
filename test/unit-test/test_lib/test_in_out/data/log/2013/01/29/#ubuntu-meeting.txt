[16:00] <rbasak> • arosales to investigate why status tracker is not picking up all servercloud area BPs
[16:00] <rbasak> Hey arosales. Is the agenda actually current?
[16:01] <arosales> Hello
[16:01] <arosales> rbasak: ya I took a look. Some of the BPs were missing work items.
[16:01] <arosales> as soon as the work items are added it should pick it up.
[16:01] <arosales> reminder to all to not include the string "work item" in the white board too :-)
[16:02] <rbasak> arosales: ok, thanks!
[16:02] <rbasak> So that takes us to the next action item:
[16:02] <rbasak> • all, check status of assigned Work Items and refresh if necessary
[16:02] <jamespage> o/
[16:02] <zul> hilo
[16:03] <rbasak> So we should all do that :)

[16:04] <rbasak> jamespage: over to you?
[16:04] <rbasak> In the agenda we have:
[16:04] <rbasak> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server
[16:04] <jamespage> rbasak, sure
[16:05] <jamespage> OK - so the maas bug list is looking much better - just a few outstanding
[16:05] <jamespage> thanks roaksoax and the maas tema
[16:05] <jamespage> looks like we have a few new ones
[16:05] <jamespage> zul, bug 1099382
[16:05] <ubottu> bug 1099382 in quantum (Ubuntu Raring) "quantum: Raring depwait on universe package alembic" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1099382
[16:06] <jamespage> I think that can be closed out now right?
[16:06] <jamespage> bug 1090593
[16:06] <ubottu> bug 1090593 in bind9 (Ubuntu Raring) " D.ROOT-SERVERS.NET changing January 3rd 2013" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1090593
[16:06] <jamespage> that one needs to be SRU'ed as well - I note that lamont has prepared packages already - any takers?
[16:06] <jamespage> maybe rbasak?
[16:07] <rbasak> Sure, I can pick that up
[16:07] <rbasak> Need to check that it's fixed in raring first
[16:07] <jamespage> I sadly have not fixed bug 671065 yet
[16:07] <ubottu> bug 671065 in dovecot (Ubuntu) "deliver broken because dovecot.conf uses !include_try" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/671065

[16:07] <jamespage> hallyn, bug 1092715
[16:07] <ubottu> bug 1092715 in qemu-kvm (Ubuntu Raring) "udevadm trigger --action=change not working in quantal and raring" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1092715
[16:08] <jamespage> ah - right - hallyn wants to make that invalid - some sort of inotify bug on some systems - that would reflect some of the behaviour I have seen
[16:09] <hallyn> jamespage: i'm talking with pitti right now about the first part of that
[16:09] <jamespage> smoser, bug 1100920 under control?
[16:09] <ubottu> bug 1100920 in cloud-init (Ubuntu Raring) "In Ubuntu 12.10, the legacy 'user' cloud-config option is not handled properly" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100920
[16:09] <jamespage> hallyn, nice one
[16:09] <jamespage> I *still* need to get the package list updated for that report
[16:10] <jamespage> so - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-raring/group/topic-raring-servercloud-overview.html
[16:10] <smoser> jamespage, yes.
[16:11] <jamespage> picking on the reds
[16:11] <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-openstack-ha
[16:11] <jamespage> is moving forwards - hopefully good working set of charms for grizzly by end of feb
[16:12] <jamespage> zul: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-openstack-grizzly
[16:12] <zul> ill update it today
[16:12] <jamespage> zul, but generally OK right?
[16:12] <zul> yeah
[16:12] <jamespage> smoser: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-image-access
[16:13] <jamespage> and hallyn: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-binfmtns
[16:13] <smoser> i'll update state there today. we're making good progress recently.
[16:14] <jamespage> smoser, nice one
[16:14] <jamespage> smb: I note actions on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-kdump-tool for you - hows that going?
[16:14] <hallyn> jamespage: yeah, i need to talk to smb and cjwatson about that binfmtns, but i think we'll postpone that
[16:14] <hallyn> one action item on there i hope to get to today, actually
[16:14] <hallyn> but the rest i just don't know we have time for this cycle
[16:15] <jamespage> hallyn, OK _ I suggest you leave in place for the time being and do a status update in the whiteboard
[16:15] <smb> jamespage, Finished a bit on that today, working with other to get other things together
[16:15] <jamespage> we can defer later
[16:15] <jamespage> smb, good-oh
[16:15]  * jamespage sighs
[16:15] <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-seeded-qa-workflow
[16:15] <hallyn> jamespage: yes, i'm not defering yet, i'm still hoping to talk to them :)
[16:15]  * jamespage hits himself round the head
[16:15] <smb> hallyn, Have not looked into that yet
[16:15] <jamespage> OK _ so that is moving very slowly
[16:15] <hallyn> smb: i think the first steps belong to myself and cjwatson
[16:15] <hallyn> (but we shouldn't talk about that here i guess :)
[16:16] <smb> hallyn, ok, agree. :)
[16:17] <jamespage> re ^^ seeded-qa-workflow
[16:17] <jamespage> hmm - well if people get time please try towrite some tests.
[16:17] <Daviey> \o/
[16:17] <jamespage> its lower priority that other work folk have on but if anyone from the ubuntu-server community has time please steal work items!
[16:18] <jamespage> Daviey, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-cloudarchive
[16:18] <jamespage> smoser: guess https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-openstack-ubuntu-images follows the blueprint above...
[16:19] <jamespage> anyway - things generally look OK; please keep you blueprints updated (weekly if poss) so we can continue to track progress

[16:23] <hggdh> jamespage: nothing should change from what we currently do; but we are going to add new jobs to cater for 12.04.2 (as opposed to 12.04.1)
[16:23] <hggdh> these jobs should be a copy of hte current ones, only using the updated iso

[16:27] <rbasak> Looks like this will be a quick meeting :)
[16:27] <arosales> quick question
[16:27] <arosales> hggdh: for my learning :-)  are the tests you are looking at for server at http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/243/builds
[16:27] <arosales> for this example it would be raring daily
[16:28] <arosales> or are there other tests ?
[16:28] <smoser> i do have a general discussion item
[16:29]  * arosales may have missed hggdh . .  .
[16:29] <hggdh> arosales: for the ISO testing should be similar to these, but for Precise.
[16:29] <smoser> Februrary 14 is "Alpha 2 for opt-in flavors" (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule)
[16:29] <hggdh> arosales: plus manual testing, and kernel testing
[16:29] <arosales> hggdh: are those tracked else where?
[16:30] <smoser> personally, i feel that we should have some concentrated test prior to and at least produce a coherant image.
[16:30] <smoser> at least for cloud-images, we keep "release" images indefinitely and its ueful to have a stick in the mud
[16:30] <smoser> does anyone have any disagreements or thoughts?
[16:30] <hggdh> arosales: the ISO testing will be tracked at iso.qa.u.c (together with manual tests), the kernel tests in Jenkins
[16:31] <utlemming> smoser: I agree with producing an alpha2
[16:32] <arosales> hggdh: ok, thanks for the info. I'll take a look at http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/ and https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/SRU%20Kernel/ for server testing coverage
[16:32] <smoser> jamespage, Daviey ?
[16:32] <smoser> i'm suggesting we run around like headless chickens to produce something that no one will use
[16:32] <rbasak> smoser: cloud images only, or CD images as well?
[16:33] <arosales> cloud images are moving to  3 week release cycle following the kernel.  Those images would have further testing and perhaps more content update than a daily.
[16:33] <jamespage> smoser, I'd +1 a cloud-image for a2
[16:33] <utlemming> arosales: except raring is exempted from that cadence until post-GA
[16:34] <jamespage> utlemming, I was hoping you might say that :-)
[16:34] <arosales> utlemming: ah, good point for dev
[16:35]  * arosales apologizes for the incorrect info there for raring.  Thanks for the correction utlemming :-)
[16:35] <arosales> I think we just need to notify the release team we want to opt in for A2
[16:36] <smoser> rbasak, i dont know about cd images.
[16:36] <smoser> i personally find the excercise useful
[16:36] <smoser> and think that by actually tryint to do things, we'll find lots of fallout
[16:37] <rbasak> OK sounds like most are in favour of a cloud A2 image anyway
[16:37] <rbasak> smoser: do you want to take an action to push that forwards?
[16:38] <smoser> sure.
[16:38] <rbasak> #action smoser to push A2 cloud image forwards
[16:38] <meetingology> ACTION: smoser to push A2 cloud image forwards
[16:38] <rbasak> Anything else for Open Discussion?
[16:38] <utlemming> rbasak: actually that should be my action
[16:39] <rbasak> utlemming: ok we'll make it your action. Not sure how to tell meetingology that though :-)
[16:39]  * rbasak will fix it in the minutes
