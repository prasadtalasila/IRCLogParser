[00:10] <snap-l> Yeah, Apple has crazy money
[00:11] <snap-l> I wonder if they have enough money to float Microsoft a loan.
[00:12] <snap-l> http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2012/08/29/apple-now-bigger-market-cap-microsoft-google-amazon-facebook-combined/
[00:12] <snap-l> Whether that's true or not, it makes a nice story.
[01:54] <jcastro> heya rick_h_
[01:54] <jcastro> I need your webdev skillz
[01:56] <rick_h_> jcastro: what's up?
[01:56] <jcastro> hey so I had my DNS on gandi
[01:56] <jcastro> but I moved to route53
[01:56] <rick_h_> k
[01:56] <jcastro> how do I know when my site has propagated fully?
[01:57] <jcastro> http://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/www.jorgecastro.org
[01:57] <jcastro> I did this
[01:57] <rick_h_> all depends on the client. In *theory* it should be as long as the TTL on the old DNS server
[01:57] <rick_h_> but that's not always followed to the second
[01:57] <jcastro> yeah so really, my only concern is that I did it right
[01:57] <jcastro> like, I'm not _sure_ that when all the dns catches up that my site will work
[01:58] <jcastro> I want to figure out how to test with the latest, even if it's not propagated
[01:58] <JonEdney> Edit your hosts file.
[01:58] <rick_h_> well to test that, just check it by specifying the dns server. http://droptips.com/using-dig-to-query-a-specific-dns-server-name-server-directly-linux-bsd-osx
[01:58] <rick_h_> do that against the route53 dns servers. Do they give you end points?
[01:58] <jcastro> yeah but I am also using cloudfront, so I don't really know what to do about /etc/hosts
[02:02] <rick_h_> do you know the ip jorgecastro.net should resolve to?
[02:02] <rick_h_> that's pointing at a server? Or just at s3/cloudfront?
[02:03] <rick_h_> http://paste.mitechie.com/show/872/ is on aws
[02:03] <rick_h_> and site loads fine for me, quick
[02:03] <rick_h_> ok, well not so quick for all assets, but quick enough
[02:07] <jcastro> just s3/cloudfront
[02:07] <jcastro> ah ok dude
[02:07] <jcastro> so ns-1790.awsdns-31.co.uk.
[02:07] <rick_h_> jcastro: yea, I think you're set
[02:07] <jcastro> is one of the new dns server things they told me to add
[02:07] <jcastro> so ... I switched out dns and everything just worked
[02:07] <jcastro> huh
[02:08] <jcastro> I was expecting everything to break
[02:08] <jcastro> but man, they do a nice job of making it convenient to use all their services instead of piecemeal
[02:08] <rick_h_> lol, naw. Unless you took down the old stuff it should update invisible
[02:08] <rick_h_> yea, AWS wins because they provide tools that work together nicely
[02:09] <jcastro> it's like, annoying to set up cloudfront and s3 with another dns provider
[02:09] <jcastro> but if you use route53 it's like, click click, here's my bucket, CDN that shit yo.
[02:09] <jcastro> done.
[02:09] <jjesse> hahahaha laughing at "CDN that shit yo"
[02:09] <jcastro> dude it's not even that
[02:09] <rick_h_> yea, every time I backup a EC2 EBS to S3 I get thinking "crap this is nice"
[02:09] <jcastro> it's just like, click, and then pay
[02:12] <jcastro> rick_h_: how brutal, my bill for my blog this month
[02:12] <jcastro> .69 cents
[02:12] <rick_h_> lol
[02:12] <jcastro> that's _with_ cloudfront
[02:12] <jcastro> normal s3 is like .18
[02:12] <jcastro> but I ain't ghetto!
[02:14] <jjesse> i can't believe my wife still watches american idol
[02:14] <JonEdney> Blame Keith Urban.
[02:14] <jjesse> probably should srsly this show should have died a long time ago
[02:14] <rick_h_> hah
[02:15] <snap-l> Am I the only person who mutters "fuck you" around Toby Keith's "I Love this Bar and Grill"?
[02:15] <jjesse> lol
[02:15] <JonEdney> haha, doubtful.
[02:15] <jjesse> and Mariah and  Nick Minaj or however you spell are terrible
[02:15] <jjesse> just burn it down
[02:16] <rick_h_> greg-g: http://www.flickr.com/photos/7508761@N03/8410275040/in/photostream :) etsy ftw for crap I can't do.
[02:16] <rick_h_> seriously, they've got anything on etsy these days
[02:16] <rick_h_> gotten a wall clock, boys apron, etc
[03:33] <snap-l> jcastro: Rush induction into the RnRHoF is April 18th
[03:33] <snap-l> THey're selling tickets to Fans on Jan 28th
[04:57] <greg-g> rick_h_: awesome! :)
[14:12] <jjesse> the android app for pebble is now live in google play
[14:12] <jjesse> though it won't do any good until you get your pebble
[14:14] <rick_h_> yea, installed it this morning
[16:32] <rick_h_> oops http://r.bmark.us/u/9ebada2bed1780
[16:32] <rick_h_> maybe that's why barracuda networks is hiring :P
[16:32] <snap-l> Oh that's no good.
[16:32] <snap-l> That's a reputation hit no security company can afford.
[16:33] <rick_h_> 10yrs is a lot of hardware
[16:34] <snap-l> Q: Did you read in there that it was intentional?
[16:35] <jcastro> snap-l: huh, so what's the catch with Ting
[16:35] <snap-l> SPrint only
[16:35] <jcastro> yeah but you don't deal with sprint directly right?
[16:35] <snap-l> And you have to buy the device, but they're working on BYOD
[16:36] <snap-l> No, you deal direct with them
[16:36] <greg-g> jcastro: right, just deal with ting
[16:36] <jcastro> oh, so I can't just switch to them if I have my own stuff
[16:36] <snap-l> They have a beta program
[16:36] <snap-l> one sec.
[16:36] <jcastro> this is nuts
[16:36] <jcastro> $416 for a galaxy nexus?
[16:36] <jjesse> thats w/o the carrier giving you any money
[16:37] <jjesse> you buy the phone outright
[16:37] <jcastro> right, I already do that.
[16:37] <jcastro> but a nexus4 is $299 from google.
[16:37] <jcastro> though sold out. :(
[16:37] <snap-l> jcastro: If you use my referral code, you can get $25 off
[16:38] <snap-l> https://help.ting.com/entries/22352167-ting-byo-s-d-supported-devices-list
[16:38] <jcastro> none of my devices are on the BYOD list
[16:38] <snap-l> Yeah, then you'd have to buy a device.
[16:38] <snap-l> http://decafbad.net/2012/06/06/i-love-my-phone-company-or-why-ting-com-is-awesome/
[16:39] <snap-l> referral is at the bottom
[16:39] <snap-l> If you have a contract, you can cancel in February, and they'll reimburse your ETF.
[16:39] <jcastro> I don't have a contract
[16:39] <jcastro> I've been on a euro-style plan for like 5 years. \o/
[16:39] <snap-l> ++
[16:40] <snap-l> Yeah, the no-contract is awesome with Ting.
[16:40] <greg-g> hey! split your referral with me! ;)
[16:40] <greg-g> kidding
[16:40] <jcastro> huh
[16:40] <jcastro> are all their phones CDMA?
[16:40] <snap-l> yes
[16:40] <jcastro> oh, it's sprint right
[16:41] <jcastro> ugh
[16:41] <greg-g> right
[16:41] <jcastro> you're killing me bro
[16:41] <snap-l> Stop leaving the country. ;)
[16:41] <snap-l> Won't matter then. ;)
[16:42] <jcastro> hey don't get me wrong, I love saving money, but I won't be giving up my gsm phone any time soon
[16:43] <greg-g> I need to figure out the regulatory process that made it so Sprint allows this (not just Ting, Virgin Mobile uses Sprint's towers, I bet MetroPCS and similar do as well)
[16:43] <jcastro> if there's ting<->tmo, count me in.
[16:43] <jcastro> greg-g: they've always resold stuff (the big carriers)
[16:43] <greg-g> jcastro: show me one other than sprint that does it, though
[16:44] <snap-l> Verizon does it
[16:44] <snap-l> Tracfone is via TMo
[16:44] <snap-l> Or at least in this area they are.
[16:44] <jcastro> http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/aboutUs/reseller/resellerFAQ.jsp
[16:44] <jcastro> here you, start greg-mobile!
[16:47] <jcastro> greg-g: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator
[16:47] <jcastro> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_mobile_virtual_network_operators
[16:47] <greg-g> huh, well then, I am proven wrong
[16:48] <jcastro> I didn't know Sprint owned boost
[16:48] <jcastro> I thought they just sold it to Boost and were like "you keep the low low end"
[16:48] <snap-l> TMo also now owns Metro PCS, iirc.
[16:49] <jcastro> "Walmart Family Mobile"
[16:49] <jcastro> man
[16:49] <jcastro> can you imagine _that_ experience
[16:49] <greg-g> lol
[16:49]  * greg-g sings the deliverance theme
[16:49] <snap-l> "Hello, I'd like to dispute a charge". "Whu?"
[16:50] <snap-l> "I said I'd like to dispute a charge". "Huh? Charge? No, we don't accept credit cards"
[16:50] <jcastro> http://www.mysimplemobile.com/
[16:50] <jcastro> looks ting-esque
[16:50] <jcastro> but for tmo
[16:50] <snap-l> "No, I mean I have a charge on my bill that I'd like to ... " "Omigawd, we don't allow ducks in the store no more. Not after the incident"
[16:51] <jcastro> my only other problem is jill never moved to her google voice #, so I'd have to like, transfer it, sigh
[16:51] <snap-l> Ting makes it easy
[16:51] <greg-g> easy peasy
[16:51] <greg-g> like, seriously easy, as easy as you think it should be
[16:51] <snap-l> And you can turn in the old phone to Gazelle for... well... pocket change.
[16:52] <snap-l> Let's not go there.
[16:52] <brousch> In February I will have like 8 months left on my Verizon contract. Ting would really pay that termination fee?
[16:52] <jcastro> yeah I've done that
[16:52] <snap-l> brousch: That's what I'm banking on
[16:52] <brousch> I keep all old smartphones for testing apps
[16:52] <snap-l> I have a Galaxy Nexus waiting to activate.
[16:52] <snap-l> brousch: Hm, maybe I should do that instead
[16:53] <jcastro> man, moving to simplemobile would make my bill go from 130 to 90
[16:53] <brousch> I'm skeptical. That's a big chunk-o-change
[16:53] <snap-l> Gazelle is offering $26 for the Thunderbolt
[16:53] <jcastro> for the 2 of us
[16:53] <snap-l> jcastro: Moving to Ting would make your bill half that.
[16:53] <snap-l> Seriously.
[16:54] <snap-l> https://ting.com/plans
[16:54] <jcastro> yeah, so I'm not willing to go to the cdma ghetto for it. All the best phones come out for gsm first
[16:55] <snap-l> It's cheap enough that you could use that for your tooling-around-the-states phone
[16:55] <jcastro> true true
[16:55] <snap-l> and then buy the OMGWTFBBQ phone before UDS
[16:55] <snap-l> it's only $6 to keep it active.
[16:55] <snap-l> per month
[16:56] <snap-l> You could put it in a drawer for 2 months and still come out ahead. ;)
[16:57] <jcastro> hmm, so 2 nexuses from google + simple seem like a decent money saving effort off the bat
[16:59] <jcastro> even @ only a 40 different with simple, that's like, a car payment over the course of a year.
[16:59] <snap-l> How much do you and Jill use your phones?
[17:00] <jcastro> I don't much, I have a gtalk landline I use which is free
[17:00] <jcastro> but she eats through minutes like a beast
[17:00] <jcastro> we need like, the 1000 min plan
[17:01] <snap-l> OK, so 1000 minutes, 2000 messages, and 1000 megabytes is 53 a month for two phones
[17:01] <snap-l> and if you go over, you just bump up
[17:01] <snap-l> 71 a month for 2gb a month
[17:01] <snap-l> and if you don't use it, they credit the difference.
[17:02] <brousch> It sounds so good it feels like a scam!
[17:02] <snap-l> so if you pay for 2000M, and only use less than 500, you get a credit of $29
[17:02] <jcastro> I get that, it sounds awesome
[17:02] <jcastro> but cdma is a deal breaker for me
[17:02] <snap-l> How often do you travel out of the country?
[17:02] <snap-l> 6 times a year?
[17:02] <snap-l> 4 times a year?
[17:03] <jcastro> it's not just that
[17:03] <snap-l> Enlighten me
[17:03] <jcastro> the phones I buy (nexuses) all come out in gsm first, by a long margin usually too
[17:04] <snap-l> OK, so you have to wait a little to buy the new toy.
[17:04] <snap-l> Are you saving money? :)
[17:04] <jcastro> craig, I know you want a referral, I'll just buy you a beer for helping me find simple. :p
[17:04] <snap-l> I'm not in it for the referral; I want you to make a good choice.
[17:05] <jcastro> well, let's see
[17:05] <jcastro> I would need 2 phones, that's $391 a pop for a galaxy nexus
[17:05] <jcastro> a phone that was slow the day it came out, over a year ago.
[17:05] <snap-l> So get the S3
[17:05] <jcastro> vs. $299 for a nexus4, which is admitably sold out
[17:06] <snap-l> The Nexus 4 is HTC< so it'll blow up in a year
[17:06] <jcastro> the s3 is even more of a joke, it's $520!
[17:06] <jcastro> also any non-nexus is an immediate deal breaker, has to be purge google.
[17:06] <jcastro> rick_h_: help me out here, I know you understand.
[17:06] <rick_h_> with jcastro, getting sick of devices on verizon :/
[17:07] <jcastro> also I meant pure google, not purge google
[17:07] <rick_h_> some of us pay for the joy of software updates and devices that don't suck
[17:07] <snap-l> OK, so you're paying $400 for a year-old phone
[17:07] <snap-l> And getting a hell of a ddeal in the process on a month-to-month basis
[17:07] <rick_h_> N4 isn't year old and is < $400 and you can get it on GSM, have latest android, and know it'll be good for the next 2 years without an issue
[17:07] <jcastro> ^^^^
[17:07] <snap-l> And you'll pay $90 a month for the privilege
[17:08] <snap-l> 1200 to have a nice toy
[17:08] <snap-l> with admittedly great coverage
[17:08] <rick_h_> phone is  more than a toy for some :P
[17:08] <jcastro> dude don't blame me, it's not my fault all those phones suck
[17:09] <snap-l> vs 480 for a year for two phones
[17:09] <snap-l> (that's about how much I pay for JoDee's dad and my phone per month)
[17:09] <snap-l> $40
[17:09] <snap-l> assuming I don't get referral bonuses
[17:09] <rick_h_> right, but what's the price when your phone has no coverage and you run out of gas, or say..hit a deer in the back wood by my uncle's house :P
[17:09] <snap-l> rick_h_: In case you hadn't noticed, Sprint is in a lot of rural areas Verizon isn't. ;)
[17:09] <rick_h_> meh, jcastro you go man.
[17:10] <jcastro> snap-l: hey so for sure, for my parents and stuff, this is awesome
[17:10] <snap-l> I mean, Sprint is in GR, and that's rural. ;)
[17:10] <rick_h_> snap-l: heh, was at music class surfing on my tablet while the ATT and Sprint folks couldn't get get/send a text message :)
[17:10] <rick_h_> and that's every wed night
[17:11] <snap-l> rick_h_: Were they on iPhones ? :)
[17:11] <rick_h_> just saying it's not so clear cut for those of us that rely on the phone and coverage.
[17:11] <snap-l> (grasping at straws, yeah)
[17:11] <rick_h_> snap-l: two iphones, one ipad, and don't know wtf the sprint phone was
[17:11] <snap-l> AT&T coverage was shit anyway.
[17:12] <snap-l> My iPhone was pretty useless when it wasn't on wifi
[17:12] <rick_h_> jcastro: let me know what yuo end up with. I'm thinking I might have to move back to ATT next contract
[17:12] <snap-l> rick_h_: Why?
[17:12] <jcastro> I am just waiting for N4's to get into stock
[17:13] <rick_h_> bring my own device and have 4g
[17:13] <rick_h_> the ATT 4g is not as good as verizon but hear it's getting better
[17:13] <snap-l> Ph, yeah, minor detail: Sprint doesn't have 4G in this area.
[17:13] <rick_h_> and I'm sick of long waits for any software updates on my nexus
[17:13] <rick_h_> might keep a verizon mifi and get phones from ATT
[17:13] <rick_h_> well, bring my own phones that is
[17:14] <snap-l> Didn't know ATT supported BYOD.
[17:14] <rick_h_> they don't really, you can buy a sim on contract and get it working though. It took some work but did get a sim working in my gsm mifi I bought for international travel
[17:15] <jcastro> tmo doesn't have 4g either, it's 3.5g
[17:15] <rick_h_> yea, when I say 4g I mean LTE
[17:15] <jcastro> they just call it 4g
[17:15] <jcastro> because they're assholes
[17:15] <snap-l> jcastro: I mean you'll only get 3g
[17:15] <snap-l> There's no 4G / LTE coverage, period
[17:16] <jcastro> ah
[17:16] <jcastro> well, as I like to say, "I'm on tmo, I'm always on 3g."
[17:16] <snap-l> You have to go to Ohio for 4G
[17:16] <jcastro> I get their "4g" HSPDA or whatever in AA and RO and in most populated areas, including my house
[17:17] <jcastro> but like, I don't care that much, all 4g means is hitting my cap faster
[17:17] <rick_h_> lol
[17:17] <jcastro> just like the comcast commercials
[17:17] <snap-l> jcastro: Oh, Ting doesn't have caps.
[17:17] <jcastro> "We're faster than anyone else."
[17:17] <jcastro> but if you do simple arithmetic you'd hit their cap in like a day.
[17:18] <snap-l> I want to know why fucking Valprasio has 4G and we don't.
[17:19] <greg-g> hey rick_h_, off topic for now, but do you still send things to your kindle to read offline, stuff like longer blog posts/articles?
[17:19] <snap-l> Yeah, talking abou phone service is so on-topic. ;)
[17:20] <greg-g> well, on-current-topic-of-discussion ;)
[17:20] <rick_h_> greg-g: no, not really. I tried to read books offline. If the article isn't worth attention now I bookmark it in case I need it but don't always go through them all
[17:20] <greg-g> this channel should be renamed #ubunu-us-mi-offtopic, but no one would be in #ubuntu-us-mi anymore ;)
[17:21] <greg-g> rick_h_: gotcha
[17:23] <rick_h_> tried/try that was
[17:25] <greg-g> ah, this is kind of nice, actually: https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/firefox
[17:28] <rick_h_> greg-g: very cool
[17:29] <rick_h_> heh, they've got the whole read it later in kindle setup.
[17:33] <snap-l> greg-g: I thought instapaper had something to move articles to the kindle
[17:34] <greg-g> snap-l: /me doesn't use instapaper
[17:34] <greg-g> snap-l: but whatever works
[17:34] <snap-l> Right, I haven't used INstapaper in a while now
[17:34] <greg-g> I thought it was a more involved process back in the day
[17:34] <snap-l> I just print to PDF and put it in a Dropbox folder.
[17:34] <greg-g> it == getting things to the kindle
[17:34] <rick_h_> yea, instapaper supported it, how I used to get stuff on there
[17:34]  * greg-g nods
[17:35] <rick_h_> you mean you first hit up r.bmark.us and then put that in the dropbox folder? :P
[17:35] <snap-l> Um, yeah
[17:35] <snap-l> tried to convince John here to use bookie instead of this scrapbooking
[17:35] <rick_h_> lol
[17:35] <snap-l> he was under the mistaken impression that Bookie didn't do images
[17:36] <snap-l> of course all of the articles I found didn't have images.
[17:36] <rick_h_> hah
[17:36] <snap-l> Or the parsing was wonky.
[17:36] <greg-g> you read the wrong news sites ;)
[17:36] <rick_h_> well, so I don't pull down and store images
[17:36] <snap-l> https://bmark.us/bmark/readable/b14e57863c22f2
[17:37] <rick_h_> but I do try to update them to the correct links if I can
[17:37] <rick_h_> ah interesting. Should file that as a bug against breadability
[17:37] <rick_h_> sucky, works with readability. I fail
[17:39] <rick_h_> http://r.bmark.us/u/fa83e5f50cba96 does better since there's more body to it
[17:39] <rick_h_> http://r.bmark.us/u/f47105aef8de5a is pretty much ugh as well
[21:27] <greg-g> grr, neither the Fx nor the Chrome official Send to Kindle plugins are working
