[04:57] <Mirv> morning
[09:32] <didrocks> sil2100: hey!
[09:32] <didrocks> sil2100: there is a new failure, but just one and on the 3 architectures!
[09:33] <didrocks> unity.tests.test_hud.HudBehaviorTests.test_alt_arrow_keys_not_eaten
[09:33] <didrocks> jibel: FYI ^
[09:33] <didrocks> we were almost there, snif!
[09:34] <sil2100> \o/
[09:34] <didrocks> sil2100: I was really believing we would release now :p
[09:34] <sil2100> didrocks: ok, let me see that then, looks like a more random failure, but maybe we can make it better not to fail
[09:34] <didrocks> at least the next/prev are fixed!
[09:34] <didrocks> sil2100: the weird thing is that it's failing on the 3 config
[09:34] <didrocks> let's hope it's reproduceable
[09:34] <didrocks> sil2100: ps-indicators-autopilot-release-testing
[09:34] <didrocks> rev 63
[09:35] <sil2100> Ah, ok, sorry, I misunderstood you
[09:35] <didrocks> seb128: popey: btw, do not hesitate to upgrade to the daily-build ppa
[09:35] <sil2100> So it's failing on all, hm hm
[09:35] <didrocks> sil2100: yep
[09:35] <didrocks> seb128: popey: I did it, and it looks good, just have this indicator failure ^
[09:36]  * sil2100 pulls latest unity
[09:36] <seb128> didrocks, you rebuilt unity with the compiz opengl abi downgraded?
[09:36] <didrocks> sil2100: daily-build ppa
[09:36] <didrocks> yep
[09:36] <popey> didrocks: i do every morning
[09:36] <didrocks> sweet ;)
[09:36] <seb128> didrocks, k, upgrading
[09:39] <sil2100> Ok, so, a check for is_focused is not enough, *sighs*
[09:40] <didrocks> sil2100: so, the test is giving a false positive?
[09:40] <didrocks> sil2100: do you know what changed from yesterday?
[09:41] <sil2100> didrocks: I have no idea, I mean, this failure seems to happen when the Terminal takes a bit longer to start - i.e. the shell on it
[09:42] <sil2100> I added a wait for the Terminal window to have focus, but as I can see it doesn't help always, since the window can be focused but not yet ready to fetch input
[09:42] <sil2100> I'll try to think of a quick clean solution
[09:44] <seb128> mhr3, hey
[09:45] <seb128> mhr3, with the current daily build my dash has a sort of weird blue "," between the expendable categories and their ">"
[09:45] <seb128> e.g "installed" in the app lens
[09:45] <didrocks> sil2100: thanks, counting on you to be able to release unity :)
[09:45] <seb128> is that normal/wanted?
[09:45] <didrocks> mhr3: confirmed here
[09:45] <mhr3> seb128, yea, i saw that with trunk some time ago
[09:45] <mhr3> not sure who did that :)
[09:46] <didrocks> you didn't ask? :/
[09:46] <mhr3> iirc the number of results wasn't displayed either in that case
[09:46] <seb128> no
[09:46] <seb128> there is only a ","
[09:46] <seb128> or "."
[09:46] <mhr3> thought it's an upcoming design change
[09:47] <seb128> well, it could be to drop the label, the weird char seems wrong and misaligned though, I somewhat doubt it's a design change
[09:47] <mhr3> andyrock, would you know something about that ^?
[09:47] <popey> it's a ':' here seb128
[09:48] <popey> you have good eyes! I never noticed that! ☺
[09:48] <didrocks> I just have a . here
[09:48] <seb128> popey, could be, I've an hard time to see exactly what char it is with my background color
[09:48] <didrocks> popey: he's good, isn't it? :)
[09:49] <andyrock> mhr3, no ask nick :)
[09:51] <andyrock> mhr3, btw if Nick is not online (or busy) i can try to fix it in the afternoon
[09:51] <didrocks> we will never be able to release unity :(
[09:52] <sil2100> huh? Something besides the AP test is broken? :(
[09:53] <didrocks> sil2100: yeah, but not linked
[09:53] <didrocks> sil2100: you can continue on the test :)
[09:53] <sil2100> Oh...
[09:53] <sil2100> ;)
[09:54] <didrocks> hey dednick :)
[09:54] <dednick> howdy
[09:54] <didrocks> seb128 | mhr3, with the current daily build my dash has a sort of weird blue "," between the expendable categories and
[09:54] <didrocks>        | their ">"
[09:54] <didrocks> seb128 | e.g "installed" in the app lens
[09:54] <didrocks> dednick: good, this and one test failing that sil2100 is working on are the last step before enabling daily release of unity :-)
[09:55] <didrocks> dednick: do you know about it? or maybe have a look at it?
[09:55] <dednick> seb128: Do you have the "See X more results" showing next to the > ?
[09:55] <seb128> no
[09:55] <seb128> that replace those labels
[09:55] <seb128> replaces
[09:56] <seb128> I've like "Installed "," >"
[09:56] <seb128> without the ""
[09:56] <seb128> didrocks and mhr3 and popey confirmed
[09:56] <dednick> ok. i think i know what this is. mandel was doing something with StaticCairoText width calculations that might have caused a regression.
[09:56] <didrocks> dednick: I just have one one the file category working, all the others are like seb128 told
[09:56] <dednick> i know it has caused some problems before
[09:56] <didrocks> interesting :)
[09:57] <dednick> didrocks: i'll check with mandel about the status of that quick.
[09:57] <didrocks> thanks :)
[09:58] <popey> didrocks: what do we need to do to allow users to file bugs against the compiz package in the daily ppa with "ubuntu-bug compiz"? I am getting the usual "This is not an official Ubuntu package" popup from apport
[09:59] <didrocks> popey: let's see if we need to do that, as the daily-build is just a 4 hours step between build and distro normally
[09:59] <didrocks> popey: if we have some stack stalled for more days, maybe it will be useful, I'm just unsure for now
[10:01] <popey> ok
=== mmrazik is now known as mmrazik|otp
[10:18] <jibel> didrocks, with unity ppa, dash blinks when I type something in the search bar, I'll try to make a video
[10:18] <didrocks> thanks jibel, duflu will maybe have some hint about it
[10:23] <sil2100> hm, there doesn't seem any 100% safe way, so I'll do it a bit hackish
[10:24] <didrocks> sil2100: so adding more timing?
[10:26] <sil2100> Or maybe, let me check something on my guest session ;p
=== mmrazik|otp is now known as mmrazik
[10:27] <jibel> popey, hey, which tool do you use to record a video of a desktop session with the dash? I tried recordmydesktop, but it's all dark and only captures the background
[10:29] <popey> jibel: kazam
[10:30] <seb128> jibel, gtk-recordmydesktop works for recording the dash, etc on my raring
[10:30] <seb128> jibel, you can always use your phone or camera or something otherwise ;-)
[10:32] <jibel> seb128, it doesn't here with raring, all updates, etc on an intel atom IGC
[10:32] <jibel> i'll try kazam
[10:35] <didrocks> dednick: did you find anything relevant?
[10:39] <jibel> seb128, finally recordmydesktop works fine, the problem comes from totem for the playback
[10:42] <seb128> ahah

[10:50] <sil2100> Ok, tested all nice solutions, none were giving me complete guarantee, so I'm using the simplest one
[10:50] <sil2100> A sleep call, yea, we like those
[10:52] <didrocks> sil2100: well, let's do that I guess…
[10:52]  * sil2100 sighs
[10:53] <sil2100> Preparing a merge
[10:53] <sil2100> I'll have a talk with thomi next week about doing it nicer, for now let's hope this will solve the issue for releasing unity
[10:54] <didrocks> sil2100: sounds good, yeah, let's do what we can for now :)
[10:54] <didrocks> but I need to know where dednick is as well, not sure if we should block the release on that issue, specifically if the fix is trivial…
[10:55] <dednick> didrocks: mandel is looking at the issue now.
[10:56] <didrocks> dednick: ah sweet, what is his IRC nickname? can he come into that chan? :)
[10:56] <dednick> didrocks: mandel
[10:56] <dednick> didrocks: i've just asked him to join
[10:57] <didrocks> thanks dednick :)
[10:57] <mandel> dednick, hello
[10:57] <didrocks> hey mandel ;)
[10:57] <didrocks> mandel: so, I guess all eyes are on you to release unity now, but no pressure :-)
[10:58] <didrocks> mandel: more seriously, do you think the fix will be trivial?
[10:58] <mandel> didrocks, hello, so I'm looking at the StaticCairotText rendering, it seems that the PrelayoutManagement does have the correct size, witch is interesting
[10:58] <mandel> didrocks,he, no pressure :)
[10:59] <didrocks> mandel: oh, "funny" did you notice it's a blue dot as well?
[10:59] <mandel> didrocks, that I did not see, let me check
[11:00] <didrocks> mandel: it's barely noticeable, but we are more than one having <category> . >
[11:00] <didrocks> with . being : for popey
[11:00] <mandel> didrocks, is more like two blue dots,  but is probably it trying to render the font and doing something wrong
[11:00] <didrocks> (and blue)
[11:00] <didrocks> ok :)
[11:00] <popey> yeah, could be squished text
[11:00] <popey> and not actually a :
[11:00] <didrocks> but why blue? :p
[11:01] <popey> well that too
[11:02] <mandel> didrocks, popey no to worry, I already have a fix, I need to clean the code a little and make sure it does not break in other cases
[11:02] <mandel> give me 15/30 mins or so to make sure
[11:02] <didrocks> mandel: you rock! :-)
[11:02] <dednick> mandel: remember to check the tooltip as well ;)

[11:04] <sil2100> Please, free karma ;)
[11:04] <mandel> didrocks, unity
[11:04] <didrocks> mandel: ok, great, thanks ;)

[11:05]  * sil2100 always wonders why he spends so much time writing all this rationale in the merge requests
[11:05] <didrocks> sil2100: I read them, worth it!
[11:05] <didrocks> :)
[11:06] <didrocks> sil2100: thanks! approved :)
[11:06] <sil2100> Thanks :)

[11:09] <andyrock> sil2100, yeah it's fine I've already tested :)
[11:09] <andyrock> thank you btw :)
[11:18] <sil2100> andyrock: updated - the name is fine btw. ;p
[11:18] <sil2100> andyrock: test it once again and if it works as it did before, approve and let's get it merged!
[11:19] <didrocks> andyrock: sil2100: can you just wait that we do this release before getting it merged?
[11:19] <didrocks> andyrock: sil2100: I don't want we add one another variable parameter before this release :)
[11:19] <sil2100> andyrock: ^ ;)
[11:20] <andyrock> didrocks, sil2100 yeah no problem :)
[11:20] <didrocks> thanks :)
[11:21] <sil2100> andyrock: let's get the testapp thing merged in the meantime
[11:25] <mandel> didrocks, so nux revno 742 fixed a logical error in the layouts (no bug number, doh!) and before that was fixed I added a workaound for statica cairo text, with the new code in nux that is not longer needed and goes wrong in a diff way, I have fixed it and changed the test to ensure everything works correctly
[11:26] <didrocks> mandel: oh interesting side effect of a workaround then :-) do you have a branch handy?
[11:26] <mandel> didrocks, please take a look at https://code.launchpad.net/~mandel/unity/static-cairo-text/+merge/142873
[11:26] <andyrock> sil2100, ok let me wrote the AP test for unity (without merging it for the moment)
[11:26]  * didrocks opens and builds while reviewing
[11:26] <sil2100> \o/
[11:26] <mandel> didrocks, I will add no comments about nux && layouts ;-)
[11:27] <didrocks> heh :)
[11:27] <didrocks> mandel: well, I know what you mean, I felt the pain in the past :)
[11:28] <mandel> didrocks, I don't know if I should feel happy because I knew where to find the problem or otherwise
[11:29] <didrocks> mandel: ahah, well, you can call that "expertise on the subject" :)
[11:29] <didrocks> some kind of niche knowledge ;)
=== _salem is now known as salem_
[11:32] <Mirv> can you reproduce that nautilus again starts behind other windows in raring+daily?
[11:34] <didrocks> mandel: confirming the fix is working! :)
[11:34] <didrocks> Mirv: hum, I don't see that
[11:34] <didrocks> mandel: nice work, thanks! ;)
[11:34] <didrocks> and still having tooltips :p
[11:34] <mandel> didrocks, take a look at the launcher, but works too, just in case :)
[11:34] <mandel> didrocks, you are faster than me ;)
[11:34] <Mirv> eg. maximized firefox, super + 1, nautilus starts to the background not front
[11:35] <Mirv> didrocks: ok, interesting, seems to me similar to what quantal had before nautilus was patched
[11:35] <didrocks> mandel: heh :)
[11:35] <didrocks> Mirv: ah indeed, if started with super + something
[11:36] <didrocks> I was cliking on the launcher
[11:36] <seb128> even clicking on the launcher it goes unfocussed for me
[11:37] <didrocks> hum, not here, maybe something with the state
[11:37] <seb128> we had to drop the nautilus patch, upstream fixed it in a different way for 3.6 which works for gnome-shell but not us
[11:37] <Mirv> same as seb128, although I noticed it requires the maximized window
[11:39] <seb128> andyrock was working on that
[11:39] <seb128> he had a patch for gtk, not sure how that is going
[11:40] <andyrock> seb128, what?
[11:40] <seb128> andyrock, nautilus not getting focus in raring
[11:40] <andyrock> again?
[11:40] <seb128> andyrock, well, "in raring", in 3.6 since we dropped your patch, since cosimoc did a different version which works for gnome-shell but not unity
[11:41] <seb128> andyrock, well, didn't you say it's a gtk bug in the timestamp handling?
[11:41] <andyrock> seb128, yeah i'm sure that gtk/gdk had that bug but startup notifications maybe can workaround it :)
[11:42] <andyrock> and unity does not support them
[11:42] <seb128> right
[11:42] <seb128> so it's not "again", it's "still" ;-)
[11:42] <seb128> andyrock, did you ever get any feedback on your gtk patch?
[11:42] <seb128> I wonder if we should just distro patch it
[11:43] <andyrock> seb128, no Trevinho and me opened a gdk bug with a very simple test program showing the issue
[11:43] <andyrock> btw we really need to support startup notification in unity
[11:44] <andyrock> Trevinho wants to do it directly in bamf
[11:44] <andyrock> but he is too busy
[11:44] <andyrock> we need to put that bug in the "polish blueprint"
[11:46] <seb128> right
[11:48] <Mirv> filed bug #1098533

[13:20] <seb128> Trevinho, not sure upstream is going to go anywhere on that anytime soon
[13:20] <Trevinho> seb128: I was talking of nautilus only.... Even if that change could maybe done at gdk level...
[13:21] <seb128> oh, ok
[13:27] <didrocks> Trevinho: another subject: on the one ws by default, do you still have something to do on the unity side?
[13:27] <didrocks> Trevinho: on the g-c-c side, I'll just set the hsize and hsize to 1x1 or 2x2 if disabled/enabled
[13:33] <Trevinho> didrocks: yes, I'm in the process of updating the shortcut-hints now... That's the final step..
[13:33] <Trevinho> didrocks: ah, and probably a few lines to remove in launcher controller (to avoid removal), but on launcher side everything is done
[13:33] <didrocks> Trevinho: ok, but agreed that on my side, I just have to do that, change hsize/vsize?
[13:33] <Trevinho> didrocks: yes, we listen to that value
[13:33] <didrocks> if one of them is > 1, you enable the "ws mode"
[13:34] <didrocks> Trevinho: excellent, thanks :)

[16:46] <didrocks> fginther: hey, I thought that merging for the latestsnapshot was skipping the build? https://code.launchpad.net/~ps-jenkins/bamf/latestsnapshot/+merge/142925
[16:49] <fginther> didrocks, no sorry, there has been no progress on that
[16:49] <didrocks> fginther: ok, you follow them and reapprove? :)
[16:50] <cyphermox> didrocks: indicator-session buils fine now (but with start-service disabled), and I got a autopkgtest test almost working; wanna do a first review before I propose a merge to actually merge this?
[16:50] <fginther> didrocks, I thought the approved rev_id issue was fixed. This is the first one of seen w/o an approved revid for many weeks
[16:50] <cyphermox> https://code.launchpad.net/~mathieu-tl/indicator-session/fix-tests/+merge/142951
[16:51] <didrocks> cyphermox: I would love to! looking :)
[16:52] <fginther> didrocks, looking into what happened here
[16:52] <didrocks> fginther: thanks :)
[16:54] <didrocks> cyphermox: it sounds good to me, did you run it with some autopkg infra?
[16:55] <cyphermox> yeah that's what I'm doing
[16:55] <didrocks> cyphermox: maybe localcheck should be integrationcheck ?
[16:55] <cyphermox> for now it's still failing but I was able to manually run it
[16:55] <cyphermox> could be
[16:55] <didrocks> ok :)
[16:55] <didrocks> cyphermox: as you wish for the naming, but this makes more sense to me than "local"
[16:55] <cyphermox> so it's just a matter of getting the autopkgtest script right
[16:55] <cyphermox> yeah
[16:55] <didrocks> sweet!
[16:55] <didrocks> :)
[16:55] <didrocks> nice work cyphermox, can't wait to see that one down! :)
[16:56] <cyphermox> yeah me too
[16:56] <cyphermox> the heavy drinking is starting to take a toll ;D
[16:56] <didrocks> cyphermox: ahah, you needed an excuse for that! :-)
[16:56] <cyphermox> didrocks: always do :P
[16:56] <didrocks> heh

[17:27] <didrocks> fginther: bamf and dee are the only 2 remaining ones not merged yet, isn't it?
[17:30] <fginther> didrocks, compiz is still building
[17:31] <didrocks> right :)
[17:32] <fginther> didrocks, yes, just those 3
[17:32] <didrocks> fginther: ok, thanks!
[17:32] <didrocks> fginther: yeah, maybe in the future, having those bypassing the build will gain a lot of CPU cycle
[17:32] <didrocks> fginther: especially as we are doing that everyday now (for all projects having new code)
[17:36] <fginther> didrocks, I'll make some time to work on this today and next week, will keep you posted
[17:36] <didrocks> fginther: excellent, thanks!
[17:36] <didrocks> fginther: if you need some special tag to recognize those kinds of merge or have any question, do not hesitate to ask!
