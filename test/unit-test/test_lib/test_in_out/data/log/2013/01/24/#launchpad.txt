[08:17] <lifeless> how do you disable gnome-keyring integration for launchpadlib ?
[08:23] <wgrant> lifeless: keyringrc.cfg
[08:24] <lifeless> ~/. ?
[08:24] <wgrant> Surely you jest
[08:24] <wgrant> python-keyring uses ~/keyringrc.cfg :)
[08:24] <lifeless> wgrant: WAAAAAT?
[08:24] <wgrant> ./keyring/core.py:    keyring_cfg_list = [os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "keyringrc.cfg"),
[08:24] <wgrant> ./keyring/core.py:                        os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "keyringrc.cfg")]
[08:24] <wgrant> But yes, wat :/
[08:25] <czajkowski> aloha
[08:25] <wgrant> That's also a reasonable attack vector.
[08:26] <lifeless> wgrant: I'm too tired to see why
[08:26] <lifeless> wgrant: what should be in that file ?
[08:27] <wgrant> lifeless: Same reason PATH doesn't include .
[08:27] <wgrant> lifeless: Um, stuff
[08:27] <wgrant> Google should know
[08:29] <lifeless> wgrant: oh, it looks in . as well, didn't read the pasted code that closely.
[08:29] <lifeless> sigh.
[08:29] <lifeless> yeah, thats poor form
[08:29] <wgrant> :D
[08:37] <lifeless> wgrant: failed...
[08:37] <lifeless> wgrant: dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.Secret.Error.IsLocked: Cannot create an item in a locked collection
[08:37] <lifeless> wgrant: after I set keyringrc.cfg to contain
[08:37] <lifeless> oh WOW
[08:38] <lifeless> something deleted ~/keyringrc.fg
[08:38] <lifeless> *.cfg*
[08:38] <lifeless> after I made it
[08:38]  * lifeless makes noise like a teapot
[08:38] <wgrant> Heh
[08:39] <lifeless> [backend]
[08:39] <lifeless> default-keyring=simplekeyring.SimpleKeyring
[08:39] <lifeless> keyring-path=/home/robertc/.cache/keyring/
[08:39] <lifeless> is what I put in it
[08:40] <lifeless> wgrant: apparently:
[08:40] <lifeless> Password file found in legacy location
[08:40] <lifeless>   /home/robertc/keyringrc.cfg
[08:40] <lifeless> and new location
[08:40] <lifeless>   /home/robertc/.local/share/python_keyring/keyringrc.cfg
[08:40] <wgrant> Ahh
[08:40] <wgrant> So it's less dreadful now?
[08:41] <lifeless> if you call moving a file around on  your file system less dreadfaul
[08:41] <lifeless> Woe to folk that run a shared homedir, for instance.
[08:41] <wgrant> Sure, but its heart is in the right place.
[08:42] <tsimpson> it checks cwd and $XDG_DATA_HOME, then falls back to ~/.local/share/python_keyring
[08:42] <czajkowski> random non lp question, any idea why a usb stick will not show up, but if I plug in external Hd via usb it does
[08:43] <lifeless> anyhow
[08:43] <lifeless> its *still* trying dbus
[08:43] <lifeless> so I can't run any LP automation
[08:43] <lifeless> czajkowski: anything in dmesg ?

[08:44] <lifeless> wgrant: File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/launchpadlib/credentials.py", line 253, in save
[08:44] <lifeless>     raise e
[08:44] <lifeless> wgrant: trivial bug there you might want to fix
[08:44] <wgrant> why would anyone do that
[08:44] <wgrant> :/
[08:44] <czajkowski> lifeless: nope will go do another reboot
[08:44] <czajkowski> cheers
[08:44] <lifeless> wgrant: because seeing the original exception is confusing to people ?
[08:44] <wgrant> lifeless: :D
[08:45] <lifeless> so now I can see that its still using the gnome backend
[08:46] <lifeless> and the docs on the library are pretty much useless for end users
[08:46] <lifeless> as they cover the case of writing your ownbackend, not using the thing.
[08:46] <lifeless> tsimpson: sorry if I'm ranting, but core facilities like this need to be held to a higher standard
[08:48] <lifeless> and yay, I'm in
[08:48] <lifeless> I will write this up as a (positive) blog post.
[08:49] <tsimpson> lifeless: I didn't write it, rant all you want ;)
[08:50] <lifeless> tsimpson: cheers ;)
[08:50] <lifeless> and now yay testtools-0.9.27 released
[08:54] <czajkowski> one for StevenK or  wgrant https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+question/219617

[17:52] <cmars232> i wrote a script that will set all the "Fix Committed" bugs to "Fix Released" for a milestone. maybe someone will find it useful? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1566712/
[17:58] <lifeless> cmars232: there may be a version in lptools already, if not thats where it should go
[18:17] <cmars232> lifeless: good call. I've opened LP: #1104299 to see how the project devs would want it done.

[18:43] <jtaylor> can you temporarily take away but report rights from the procstef user? he is filing hundreds of duplicates because his perl failed during upgrade

[18:58] <dobey> jtaylor: has anyone e-mailed him and told him to stop?
[18:58] <jtaylor> he should get mails due the duplications
[18:58] <jtaylor> though those may go into his spam by now
[18:59] <dobey> though, why would someone bother doing all that work to file the same bug so many times
[19:00] <dobey> must be a masochist, or really likes the launchpad bug filing UX
[19:00] <dobey> :)
[19:00] <lifeless> they are probably trying very hard to behelpful

[23:37] <alesage> hi, staging launchpad has been updating for a while--authentically updating or needing a nudge?
