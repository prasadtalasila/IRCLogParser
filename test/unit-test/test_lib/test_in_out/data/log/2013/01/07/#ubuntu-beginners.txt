[04:32] <r4y> I need some help. My other computer is having trouble, but I don't want to go into detail at all right now. Instead I want to bypass having to use the ide ports, cables, hard drive to narrow down those being the possible problem from any other possible problem(s)
[04:33] <r4y> Do I use this to test Ubuntu on a usb drive or is it just for installing Ubuntu?

[04:43] <r4y> Should I ask the ubuntu channel instead?
[04:48] <r4y> I asked the ubuntu channel and someone seemed to think it is for both
[04:49] <r4y> bye
