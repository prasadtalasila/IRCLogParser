[08:58] <Glitchd> ddfgt, ..?
[08:58] <ddfgt> i used teamspeak time ago..
[08:59] <Glitchd> well then that would mean u dont actually use it. u used to use it.
[08:59] <Glitchd> meaning past tense
[08:59] <Glitchd> im talking present tense

[09:08] <Glitchd> what version ubuntu?
[09:09] <Glitchd> oh duh.
[09:10] <Glitchd> it has something to do with putting the username and password in fstab
[09:11] <Glitchd> do u want it to automount or to just mount in general?
[09:12] <Glitchd> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1380583
[09:13] <Glitchd> Solution for 12.04
[09:13] <Glitchd> sudo apt-get install smbfs
[09:13] <Glitchd> Change cifs to smbfs in fstab listings.

[14:21] <jabba_> hello... is there so,e special trick one might know to enable pci-passthrough to a xen/pvops virtual machine?
[14:22] <jabba_> i mean besides binding the pci-device to pciback, passing the pci-identifiers to the vm-config and setting iommu=soft as kernel parameter in the guest?
[14:23] <Daniel988> Hey. I am testing a server for one month. provider wrote: raid1 (2x1TB hdd). How can I check if raid is enabled. cat /proc/mdstat shows nothing.
[14:25] <jabba_> i am searching for 3 days now, yesterday i spent hours with a kernel-hacker (friend of mine, who does kernel programming all day at work) until 5am, but we didn't get it working... i am really desperately searching for help.
[14:27] <jabba_> used configuration was dom0: ubuntu12.04, domU: ubuntu 12.04. until now both are on 12.10 - as we both suggested a kernel update might help (which didn't)
[14:29] <jabba_> Daniel988: hardware or software raid?
[14:31] <jabba_> xen pci-passthrough can't be that hard under ubuntu... maybe it is the xapi stack i am using? might that be? perhaps not stable yet?
[14:33] <jabba_> the weird thing is: i got it all working using the xcp-distribiution from citrix. but they use kernel 2.6.[something] which could not handle the device i want to passthrough...

[17:06] <sw0rdfish> how do I make sure openvpn starts automatically on restart
[17:08] <RoyK> well, upstart should do
[17:08] <RoyK> or an init script
[17:09] <andol> ...unless your OpenVPN conenction has som dependencies the stock upstart/init script isn't aware of.
[17:09] <RoyK> otherwise, if you want to restart if failing, use something like puppet or cfengine

[17:38] <M0rsa> Hello
[17:46] <RoyK> hi
[17:56] <TheLordOfTime> so, who do i need to stab about the php5 packaging
[17:56] <TheLordOfTime> because apparently packages were dropped from building in raring which are causing complaints
[18:01] <TheLordOfTime> nevermind, i figured it out...
[18:04] <andol> TheLordOfTime: How to fix the build, or who to stab? :)
[18:05] <TheLordOfTime> ehh nevermind,.
[18:06] <TheLordOfTime> figuired out the cause, apparently 5.4.9 in Raring has packages disabled which prevent backporting
[18:06]  * TheLordOfTime leaves it be
[18:07] <TheLordOfTime> they disabled building of modules... because there's separate ones in universe...
[18:07] <TheLordOfTime> not entirely sure... *why* they did that, though...
[18:13] <subman> I currently have a /home directory being backed up successfully via rsync.  I also want to back up the /var/mail/user file.  Could I create a symbolic link in each of the users /home directories and rsync would then backup the mail file in /var/mail/?
[18:23] <subman> I think I found my answer, thanks.

[20:05] <magma> hi, I have a cluster with 6 machines, is it possible to execute a sudo apt-get upgrade in all of them with pssh?
[20:08] <atyoung> i script that and run it from my "master" node.
[20:09] <magma> how do you script that?
[20:09] <magma> with a for loop in a bash script?
[20:10] <magma> doing something like ssh user@host "sudo apt-get upgrades; y" ?
[20:12] <atyoung> yeah
[20:13] <atyoung> I have ssh key auth, my script essentially passes the apt-get command arguments captures the stout and send it to the console in the master node.
[20:14] <atyoung> There are probably other ways but it was quick and dirty and with 2 nodes made it simple
[20:14] <magma> humm
[20:14] <magma> would you share your script?
[20:15] <tasslehoff> first server install ever. this be the place to ask install advice, or should I go to ubuntu-installer?
[20:15] <atyoung> I would but I'm at work, they frown on remoting to our personal networks heh
[20:16] <atyoung> o_O paranoid
[20:17] <atyoung> it's not hard though just set up key auth ssh to your nodes, with hte same key and then has ssh send the commands man ssh will give ya the syntax
[20:17] <tasslehoff> I have a 60gb ssd as systemdisk, and 4 hdd's that I want to run in RAID5. Should I just format the ssd as ext4, and use it as / ?
[20:17] <magma> just the thing of capturing the stdout, I don't know how to do
[20:17] <magma> but I will try something
[20:17] <magma> I already have the keys
[20:19] <atyoung> if I remember correctly thats a ssh feature, you can grab the output on the remote with a flag on your ssh command. The tax escapes me at the moment, i've used it for years so I just don't remember ;)
[20:19] <magma> ok I will check that out :)
[20:21] <atyoung> Maybe I'll look at it when I get home, make it more universal and post it on github heh
[20:22] <atyoung> I think I figured there was already a solution for that
[20:22] <atyoung> But perhaps not.
[20:23] <taofd> anyone know what the syntax is for mount -t cifs? i can't find anything in the man pages, and not sure what "mount.cifs" man is pointing to or supposed to be
[20:23] <taofd> i want to access a remote smb share
[20:26] <magma> atyoung: just a thing I have the keys for my user set and I can connect with no problem. But if I want to run as sudo it asks me for a password
[20:26] <magma> do I have to put the keys in the /root/.ssh/?
[20:28] <jacobw> magma: no, your user needs to have sudo access
[20:29] <magma> jacobw: my user has user access and the keys are ok
[20:29] <magma> I can connect to other node without password
[20:29] <jacobw> magma: SSH has granted to a shell as a your user, not the root user, in the same way as gnome-terminal grants you a shell as your user on the desktop
[20:30] <jacobw> magma: sudo works in the same way on the desktop and on the server
[20:30] <magma> jacobw: If I try sudo ssh myuser@node2 it asks me for password
[20:31] <magma> oh I think I know what the problem is
[20:31] <jacobw> magma: it's asking for the passphrase for your SSH key
[20:31] <magma> my localhost key is not on my localhost authorized keys
[20:31] <magma> jacobw: no
[20:31] <magma> if I execute any command with sudo it asks me password
[20:36] <jacobw> magma: yes, sudo requires a user to enter they're password to execute a command as another user

[20:38] <magma> thanks
[20:42] <magma> btw, I can't ping my machines through their hostname
[20:43] <magma> what could be the problem?
=== cpg|away is now known as cpg
[21:01] <jacobw> magma: are you using just they're hostname (foo) or their fully qualified domain names (foo.bar.com)?
[21:01] <jacobw> magma: if you're on the same subnet, try pinging foo.local
[21:01] <magma> just the hostname
[21:05] <jacobw> does the machine have an FQDN? try pinging the local address, if it has an FQDN add the root your hosts domain to the your search domains
[21:06] <jacobw> magma: you can use something like .bar.com as a search domain to query foo.bar.com instead of foo first
[21:07] <jacobw> magma: you can set search domains in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head or /etc/resolv.conf or network-manager
[21:08] <magma> ok I will try that
[21:08] <magma> I don't know if I have FQDN
[21:10] <magma> "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN"
[21:11] <magma> do I need to reboot so that my changes take effect?
[21:14] <magma> jacobw: I added the search domain
[21:14] <magma> do I need to reboot the machine?
[21:15] <jacobw> magma: no
[21:15] <jacobw> do `dig node2` and check that it matches the IP address of node2
[21:18] <magma> I don't see the ip of node2
[21:18] <magma> in the SERVER I see something like XXXXX.41.1#53
[21:19] <jacobw> that's address of the name server the records came from
[21:19] <jacobw> can you describe your environment for me?
[21:20] <magma> I don't know exactly
[21:20] <magma> :S
[21:20] <jacobw> ok
[21:20] <jacobw> do you know if your on the same subnet as node2?
[21:20] <magma> I've been trying to figure that out via ssh
[21:21] <magma> the ips are the same
[21:21] <magma> the first node ends in 141, the second in 142
[21:21] <magma> I can ping using the ip of node 2
[21:21] <jacobw> which is the host that your using?
[21:21] <jacobw> (it's address)
[21:21] <magma> but using its hostname I can't, unless I have it in /etc/hosts
[21:22] <jacobw> /etc/hosts overrides the domain name system
[21:22] <magma> where is located the domain name system?
[21:22] <jacobw> so node1 is at 141 and node2 is at 142, where is your pc?
[21:22] <magma> my pc is on another network
[21:23] <magma> I'm connected to 141 via ssh
[21:23] <magma> and trying to ping node2 through its hostname
[21:23] <jacobw> see if you can ping node2.local
[21:23] <jacobw> from node1

[21:24] <magma> no
[21:24] <magma> ping: unknown host XXXXXX
[21:26] <magma> I think I have to reboot something for the editions on /etc/resolv.conf to work
[21:32] <magma> where is located the domain name system file?
=== cpg is now known as cpg|away
[21:37] <jacobw> magma: the domain name system is distributed, all name servers on the internet either delegated to by another name sever or delegate to other name servers or both
[21:37] <magma> ok
[21:38] <jacobw> magma: the resolver on your host uses which ever name server you've configured to query for any name it doesn't know the address of
[21:38] <magma> I see
[21:39] <jacobw> magma: the resolver is configured in /etc/resolv.conf, in recent version of ubuntu /etc/resolv.conf is dynamically generated by resolvconf which is configured in /etc/resolvconf/
[21:41] <jacobw> magma: the domain .local resprents all the hosts known to ARP, i.e. all the hosts in the same subnet
[21:42] <jacobw> magma: can you ping node1 from node2?
[21:43] <magma> no
[21:43] <magma> what's the arp command to see its cache?
[21:44] <magma> arp
[21:44] <magma> I can see the hosts there
[21:45] <jacobw> if the other hosts have names, you should see them in the addresses column
[21:45] <jacobw> what does `hostname` say on node1 and node2?
[21:46] <magma> does it matter?
[21:46] <jacobw> i don't know
