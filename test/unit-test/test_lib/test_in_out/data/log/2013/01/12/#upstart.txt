[07:16] <Rosuav> Hi, I'm having trouble building Upstart from source, is this the place to ask?
[07:17] <Rosuav> Hi JanC, are you familiar with building Upstart from source?

[22:42] <rhagu> hi I am running ubuntu 12.04 and want mediatomb to run on a trunked interface called bond0 and created with ifenslave, I therefore changed its upstart conf from: start on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE=lo) to start on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE!=bond0), this setup sadly does not start mediatomb, what can I do now?
