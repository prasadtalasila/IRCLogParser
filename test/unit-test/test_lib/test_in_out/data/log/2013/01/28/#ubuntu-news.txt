[03:59]  * pleia2 sighs
[04:00] <pleia2> there were a couple really short summaries so I asked the other summary writers to pitch in, but someone just added a note asking the original person to do it (they're probably long gone) or else saying the editors would do it :\
[04:00] <pleia2> which means now I have to do it...
[04:13] <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2: already done?
[04:13] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: nope
[04:13] <JoseeAntonioR> I'll check if I can do those
[04:13] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: if you could help that would be great, first two planet posts
[04:13] <pleia2> er, 2nd and 3rd
[04:13] <JoseeAntonioR> sure, checking now
[04:19] <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2: are those better?
[04:19] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: you're my hero :)
[04:19] <JoseeAntonioR> :)
[04:19] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: be sure to add your name to credits if you want credit ;)
[04:19] <JoseeAntonioR> no worries
[04:20] <JoseeAntonioR> just let me know if there's something I can help with, school starting in more than a month so I've still got time
[04:23] <pleia2> thanks!
[04:23] <JoseeAntonioR> also, done the webupd8 summary
[04:24] <pleia2> I hadn't gotten that far in the doc, thank you :)
[04:33] <pleia2> wow, I am so tired
[04:33] <pleia2> trying to get through this, stats may have to wait until tomorrow though
[04:35] <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2: would you prefer if I do the moving and email the editors?
[04:35] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: want to start moving articles? I'm doing the once through of editing, on Blogosphere now :)
[04:36] <JoseeAntonioR> ok, /me starts
[04:36] <pleia2> ergh, didn't realize unity reboot was a ppa, I don't like it
[04:36] <pleia2> pulling this article
[04:37] <pleia2> it scares me :)
[04:37] <JoseeAntonioR> lol ,ok
[04:37] <pleia2> sorry
[04:40] <pleia2> ok, my editing once through is done, feel free to move everything over :)
[04:42] <JoseeAntonioR> ok! :)
[04:44] <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2: we should tell link collectors to add spaces between === and the title
[04:45] <pleia2> I do, but it's hard to explain why that's important
[04:45] <pleia2> they forget :\
[04:45] <JoseeAntonioR> np then
[04:47] <JoseeAntonioR> pulling stats...
[04:51] <JoseeAntonioR> do we still have translations updates?
[04:52] <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2: ^
[04:52] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: no :( they're all wrong
[04:52] <pleia2> just deleting that section for now until we can get something that's accurate
[04:52] <JoseeAntonioR> oh :(
[04:52] <pleia2> the current script does all of launchpad or something crazy, not accurate
[04:53] <JoseeAntonioR> and I'm having a little prob with brainstorm
[04:53] <pleia2> what's the trouble?
[04:53] <JoseeAntonioR> it only lists one popular idea for the week
[04:53] <pleia2> yeah, that happens
[04:53] <pleia2> we haven't had 5 in weeks
[04:54] <pleia2> just change the title to "top brainstorm idea" or something
[04:54] <JoseeAntonioR> ok, I'll do that now
[04:58] <JoseeAntonioR> for hardy updates I have none, I'm putting ' * None for the week'
[04:59] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: yep, thanks!
[05:04] <pleia2> \o/
[05:06] <JoseeAntonioR> and email sent to editors
[05:06] <JoseeAntonioR> we're done for today, now go and have some rest :)
[05:07] <pleia2> indeed!
[05:07]  * pleia2 hugs
[05:07]  * JoseeAntonioR hugs back
[05:16] <Unit193> In theory it's alright.
[05:16] <Unit193> Linkwise that is.
[07:39] <dholbach> good morning
[22:10] <pleia2> The new edition of the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter is now available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue301
[22:15] <Unit193> All failing links are expected, still good.
[22:18] <pleia2> I really need a "Unit193: please check links" step so it doesn't always happen *after* we publish
[22:19] <Unit193> Well, typically if I see a wiki link, I check it. :P  Also:  [00:16:13] < Unit193> In theory it's alright.
[22:19] <Unit193> [00:16:21] < Unit193> Linkwise that is.
[22:20] <pleia2> :)
[22:20] <pleia2> thanks
