[11:57] <ebischoff> Hello people and happy new year. Is it normal that libselinux1 libsemanage libsemanage-common got installed on raring? I thought ubuntu was using AppArmor. I don't have these packages on Quantal.
[13:08] <hggdh> ebischoff: seems to, I also have these packages
[13:14] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[13:28] <ebischoff> hi BluesKaj
[13:28] <ebischoff> hggdh: worth a bug report?
[13:29] <BluesKaj> hi ebischoff
[13:31] <hggdh> ebischoff: at least a query on #ubuntu-devel if this expected
[13:33] <ebischoff> good idea, thanks
[13:43] <ebischoff> OK, the answer is twice:
[13:43] <ebischoff> 1) only libsemanage* libraries are new. libselinux* was already included in Quantal
[13:44] <ebischoff> 2) it makes the life easier to people who drop in a kernel with selinux enabled
[13:47] <ebischoff> bye
[13:58]  * BluesKaj wonders if the 3.7 kernel is being patched to accommodate some amd 64 bit cpus and nvidia drivers that break or prevent the 13.04 / 3.7 kernel install
