[06:41] <mundonet> hola
[06:41] <mundonet> hay alguien??
[06:42] <mundonet> que hable español??
[06:42] <Unit193> !es | mundonet
[06:42] <ubottu> mundonet: En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #xubuntu-es; escriba "/join #xubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y presione intro. Si nadie responde, puedes intentar preguntando en #ubuntu-es.
[06:43] <mundonet> gracias
[06:45] <Unit193> Da nada.
[07:10] <xubuntu048> so Have a question
[07:11] <xubuntu048> regarding the best server to use with xubuntu
[07:14] <xubuntu048> whatever... no response i'm out
[09:02] <heraclitis> I'm having problems with my networking connection. I try to ping my loopback, no response. My gateway, no response.
[09:02] <baizon> heraclitis: post your ifconfig output on paste.ubuntu.com please
[09:03] <moetunes> heraclitis:  does   ifconfig -a   show the device is UP ?
[09:06] <heraclitis> moetunes: yes pasting in a few seconds. Had to transfer from one computer to another.
[09:08] <heraclitis> Pasted.
[09:08] <baizon> heraclitis: post link here ;)
[09:08] <heraclitis> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1557867/
[09:08] <heraclitis> I see how that works. That's pretty awesome.
[09:09] <baizon> heraclitis: try to ping 192.168.0.1
[09:10] <baizon> or what is your gateways ip adress?
[09:10] <heraclitis> I waited 13103ms, 100% packet loss. 14 packets transmitted. And my gateway is 192.168.0.1
[09:10] <heraclitis> ip address 192.168.0.80
[09:10] <heraclitis> netmask 255.255.255.0
[09:11] <baizon> heraclitis: yes, saw it on your paste
[09:11] <heraclitis> ignore ipv6, it's irrelevant (my router doesn't support it).
[09:11] <baizon> is it your home network?
[09:12] <heraclitis> It is my home network.
[09:12] <baizon> heraclitis: you dont use a mac filter right?
[09:12] <heraclitis> negative
[09:13] <heraclitis> Never could get that configuration to work properly. lol
[09:15] <heraclitis> What baffles me is that I can't even ping my own computer.
[09:15] <baizon> you cant ping localhost?
[09:17] <moetunes> is there a /etc/hosts file that mentions localhost ?
[09:18] <heraclitis> negative. And when I ping from my laptop, I get this response: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1557884/
[09:18] <heraclitis> And no, I can't ping localhost. Give me one second moetunes. I'll check
[09:20] <baizon> heraclitis: try to ping 127.0.0.1
[09:20] <heraclitis> I have 127.0.0.1 listed as Localhost in /etc/hosts. And 127.0.1.1 as $compname in the same file.
[09:21] <heraclitis> I ping 127.0.0.1 with 100% packet loss
[09:25] <heraclitis> I've been monitoring the interface with wireshark, and I get icmp Destination unreachable (host unreachable) errors. All traffic is local, from 46132 using the UDP protocol
[09:25] <moetunes> can you paste /etc/hosts ?
[09:25] <heraclitis> Occasionally I'll get an attempted ARP to the default gateway. And I'll paste that in a second.
[09:27] <moetunes> I'm pretty sure it'll be a config somewhere
[09:28] <heraclitis> moetunes: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1557904/
[09:29] <moetunes> so hostname is unreal?
[09:29] <heraclitis> Yes
[09:30] <heraclitis> It was the first thing that came to mind
[09:30] <heraclitis> While installing
[09:30] <heraclitis> You know, like "unreal, man"
[09:30] <moetunes> what is setting the eth1 to 198.168.0.80 ?
[09:31] <moetunes> why is it 127..0.1.1 in /etc/hosts?
[09:31] <moetunes> why is it 127.0.1.1 in /etc/hosts?
[09:32] <heraclitis> My networking connections is setting it to 192.168.0.80. Manual configuration. And I don't know why it's 127.0.1.1 That caught my attention as well.  Should I make it the same as localhost?
[09:32] <moetunes> no - make it 192.168.0.80
[09:33] <heraclitis> Okay one sec.
[09:39] <heraclitis> Done, restarted networking. I get this error when restarting: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1557947/
[09:41] <heraclitis> I'm guessing my /etc/network/interfaces should contain something referring to eth0 or eth1 and their ip configuration, but I don't know the syntax, or if I'm right.
[09:44] <moetunes> try    service network restart
[09:46] <heraclitis> I believe the syntax of that command would be "service networking restart" and it says stop:Unknown instance:Start: Job failed to start
[09:46] <heraclitis> Bad formatting there.
[09:48] <moetunes> have you installed xubuntu in ubuntu then manually set the network up?
[09:49] <moetunes> seems like you need to set the /etc/network/interfaces file up manually too
[09:54] <heraclitis> No, it was a fairly fresh install of xubuntu from the desktop iso image. I needed something faster than ubuntu. And I just tried setting up the /etc/network/interfaces file manually. No luck. Same error as before. I followed the syntax for static routing as shown here: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html#_the_basic_syntax_of_etc_network_interfaces
[09:55] <heraclitis> I actually have two network adaptors. Both were working until this last boot. Now one says "device not managed". And the other is giving me problems.
[09:56] <heraclitis> I've even tried using usb instead of ethernet to connect. I do have dhcp disabled on my modem, and I'm using google's dns servers. So I have to statically route.
[09:57] <moetunes> ok. I'd try another reboot just to check if it is a one of glitch or check in dmesg for clues on why it filed
[09:58] <moetunes> *failed
[09:58] <heraclitis> okay. Rebooting now.
[10:01] <heraclitis> The plymouth splash screen says "Waiting for network configuration". That's new. Doesn't seem to be working. How do I access dmesg? And what sort of clues should I watch for?
[10:04] <moetunes> I would start with   dmesg | grep -i net   in a terminal
[10:07] <heraclitis> I don't know how to read this output, so I'll send it your way. Give me a sec.
[10:09] <heraclitis> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1558101/
[10:15] <moetunes> there seems to be some fail there on the "terminated with status 1" lines and the last suggests networkmanager is starting
[10:17] <heraclitis> I discovered one error, in the /etc/network/interfaces. Where it said "iface lo", it should have said "auto lo". So now I can ping localhost "unreal" (compname).
[10:18] <heraclitis> Now I need to gain lan access. I'm going to try to reboot, and see if the changes to /etc/network/interfaces made a difference.
[10:22] <heraclitis> Off topic, but how to I read the messages that are listed during shutdown? I keep getting something about "insecure pipe" (to paraphrase immensely). It scrolls by too quickly to read it. I know it's not related to this issue though.
[10:25] <heraclitis> I've restarted. I'm now getting a massive packet loss while pinging the default gateway, but I'm getting one. Average packet loss seems to be about 94%. (2 of 35 received). Making progress. Lol
[10:25] <heraclitis> No connection to outside world, though.
[10:28] <moetunes> shutdown messages aren't logged anywhere
[10:30] <heraclitis> Before restart, I also edited the /etc/network/interfaces to read: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1558224/
[10:30] <moetunes> I'm guessing there is still something upn with your interfaces file
[10:32] <moetunes> remove the dns-domain line and eth0 can't be auto and static afaik
[10:35] <heraclitis> I just remembered something that may make a difference. I've been playing around with tor for a while, and me being the "monkey see, monkey do" type with computers (i like to see what'll happen)... I edited some of the configuration of ~/.ssh
[10:35] <heraclitis> And I removed that line. Is there a way to reset ~/.ssh to defaults?
[10:36] <moetunes> ssh won't interfere with a net connection
[10:36] <moetunes> http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html#_the_network_interface_with_the_static_ip
[10:36] <heraclitis> after removing "auto" and the "dns domain" lines from the file, I loose connectivity from the default gateway.
[10:37] <moetunes> ^ says no auto wiyh static
[10:38] <moetunes> nameserver should be in /etc/resolv.conf instead of the interfaces file
[10:38] <heraclitis> oh okay. I'll change that.
[10:39] <heraclitis> When I go to change that file it says "Do not edit this file by hand -- Your changes will be overwritten"
[10:40] <heraclitis> it says nameserver is 127.0.0.1
[10:40] <moetunes> that's from networkmanager which you should make sure doesn't run if you are manually setting the network
[10:43] <heraclitis> so I should change nameserver to 8.8.8.8 if I want it to be google's dns server?
[10:45] <moetunes> yes if you stop networkmanager from running
[10:46] <moetunes> can't stress that enough
[10:46] <moetunes> can't stress that enough
[10:47] <heraclitis> How do I stop networkmanager from running on boot? I know I can stop it while the comp is running, but at boot it'll try to start automatically, won't it?
[10:50] <moetunes> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager#Disabling_NetworkManager
[10:55] <heraclitis> I'm up and running. I deleted everything in the /etc/network/interfaces with the exception of "auto lo" and "iface lo inet loopback". Then I stopped networking by running "sudo service network-manager stop" then I ran "sudo start network-manager". Worked like a charm. I'm viewing google now from that computer. Thanks for everything, sir. I wish there were a way to repay you for your time and effort.
[10:56] <moetunes> you gave up doing the manual setup you had? glad it's working :)
[10:59] <heraclitis> I am still using manual ip address and dns configuration. But through network manager. I can't use auto dns or address leasing through my router. It's a pos from my ISP. I need to get a cisco. Lol. I'm glad it's working, too.
[11:00] <heraclitis> Now I can finally get off this Ubuntu 12.04 laptop. After using xubuntu, I can't go back. I'll find you when I log in over on my desktop.
[11:08] <heraclitis> Thanks again, moetunes!
[11:08] <moetunes> cheers ;)
[11:15] <heraclitis> moetunes: are you using pidgin? If so, I have a movie I'd like to give you in exchange for your help.
[11:20] <moetunes> heraclitis:  I use weechat and I saw the movie was ready to be transfered but I have plenty of movies thaks ;)
[11:20] <moetunes> s/thaks/thanks/
[11:21] <heraclitis> No thank you. If there's anything I help you with, let me know. I'd be glad to try.
[11:22]  * Yotson (scratching each others back)++ :D
[11:23] <moetunes> it's all good. this is what support channels are for :)
[12:40] <niuniomartinez> Hi. I have a problem with OpenGL.
[12:41] <niuniomartinez> It does work (Open Arena, SuperTux Kart, eDuke32) but Allegro has some problems.
[12:43] <niuniomartinez> They suggested (http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/61153) that it's a problem with drivers.
[12:44] <niuniomartinez> But I don't know which one I'm using...
[14:09] <Cristiano> Pessoal alguém ai poderia me dizer se o conky funciona bem no Xubuntu 12.10?
[14:32] <heraclitis> how to proxy all terminal commands like wget, hg, and apt?
[14:34] <koegs> heraclitis: http://askubuntu.com/questions/69983/proxy-settings-not-working
[14:34] <koegs> the rest depends on the programs
[16:23] <heraclitis> good voip service for pstn on xubuntu? not cisco?
[16:25] <holstein> heraclitis: "good" is a matter of opinion.. what are you looking for? and what have you tried? and what hasnt worked about what you have tried? i thought pstn was not a voip
[16:26] <heraclitis> I have only used Magicjack, but it only works in Windows. I would stay in Ubuntu all the time if my phone service could be transferred here as well. Magicjack uses voip to transfer to pstn. I would like something I could use with a current number, or a new one for little to no cost. Up time of more than 80 percent would be great, as well. secure would be excellent, but not a requirement.
[16:28] <holstein> heraclitis: you can port your # to google voice or a similar service and use it on the operating system or device you choose
[16:28] <heraclitis> I've been giving serious thought to nettalk... it can stand alone or be plugged into a computer. Similar to magicjack. I'm using the old usb dongle for magicjack.
[16:28] <heraclitis> Good point. I didn't think about google voice.
[16:28] <heraclitis> And that will allow me to make calls from my computer as though it's my old number, correct?
[16:29] <holstein> heraclitis: im not a google-fan-boy... i just like the service... there are a lot of options with google voice
[16:31] <holstein> chase follow... widgets that will go straight to voicemail and not show your #... dialing to and from other #'s... custom voicemail messages... plus, it works in the browser with linux
[16:31] <heraclitis> Lol. I reserve judgment with Google. And what's this chase follow? Is it in Synaptic?
[16:32] <holstein> heraclitis: if you want to program a few #'s for google voice to try... it'll try one.. then the next.. so on, til you either answer one of the phones, or it goes to voicemail
[16:33] <heraclitis> That's pretty neat.
[16:33] <heraclitis> I'm checking it out now.
[16:35] <holstein> heraclitis: its not a "linux" solution, but it works in linux... i would just read about it, and feel free to /join the #xubuntu-offtopic channel and i'll share more specifics
[17:13] <Ronalds_M> how to reset password in freenode
[17:14] <Ronalds_M> damn nickserv is saying that I'm not allowed to do that
[17:16] <holstein> Ronalds_M: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#changepass
[17:34] <Ronalds_M> tnx Holstein
[17:34] <Ronalds_M> but in reality
[17:34] <Ronalds_M> freenode has turned that thing off
[17:34] <Ronalds_M> so you have to go to freenode channel
[17:34] <Ronalds_M> and ask staff to reset it
[17:50] <holstein> Ronalds_M: that thing?
[17:51] <holstein> Ronalds_M: you should alert the staff in the channel if the documentaion is not current

[18:04] <heraclitis> how to allow virtualbox through ufw?
[18:04] <heraclitis> nat or bridged best?
[18:04] <holstein> heraclitis: i usually change settings so the vm gets an ip from the router
[18:04] <holstein> then, its the same as if it were a normal machine on the network
[18:05] <heraclitis> and would that be nat or bridged to config that way?
[18:06] <holstein> heraclitis: i dont think you can bridge, and share the IP of the main machine, and get a seperate IP to the VM
[18:06] <heraclitis> I have two network adaptors. (3 if necessary).
[18:06] <heraclitis> If that makes a difference.
[18:07] <holstein> heraclitis: i have only ever set up the VM so it gets an IP from the main gateway, just as a normal machine...
[18:07] <heraclitis> I have it set up that way. default gateway is the same, ip lease is the same, dns the same, but only lo (127.0.0.1) has any activity or connectivity.
[18:09] <holstein> heraclitis: you are getting an ip from theh gateway? can you ping the gateway? and/or other machines on your network?
[18:09] <holstein> did you "break" the dns settings trying to set a static ip?
[18:09] <heraclitis> no ping from gateway on VM, from host, yes. I'm communicating with you on it. And I set up my dns manually.
[18:10] <holstein> heraclitis: then its not set up properly
[18:10] <holstein> heraclitis: when you can ping the gateway, you'll be able to forward ports from the gateway to the VM
[18:10] <heraclitis> I'll keep working at it. lol
