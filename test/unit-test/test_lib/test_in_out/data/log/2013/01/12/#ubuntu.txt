[00:03] <ubuntu-tester> machicola: how do you define 'finish' moment?
[00:04] <daftykins> ogist: i can't believe it's not a mac.
[00:05] <Feedhurley> ubuntu-tester are you still here, sorry got disrupted... how do i remove the /dev/sdb lines?
[00:05] <machicola> ubuntu.... the main loading process
[00:05] <machicola> ubuntu-tester, the main loading process for the windows session
[00:06] <Stephini> hia
[00:06] <machicola> once the processor is no longer busy with loading xwindows
[00:06] <machicola> i want the script to start
[00:07] <machicola> if there are minor things afterwards, i'm not concerned with those
[00:07] <Stephini> anyone on with experience using wireless x360 pads on ubuntu?
[00:07] <ubuntu-tester> Feedhurley: with any text editor, i guess :)
[00:08] <jarvis_> Ok, I'm trying to decide a good way to split this computer up. I have a 120GB SSD, and a 500GB spinning drive. I want to dual boot buntu/win7. What are some good options. I use linux for school/programming, and windows for gaming.
[00:08] <ubuntu-tester> machicola: well you can check LA in script
[00:09] <machicola> ubuntu-tester, what do you mean?
[00:09] <Stephini> jarvis give each os ~20-30 on the SSD then the rest for your big load games and the off drive for everything else?
[00:09] <Feedhurley> ubuntu-tester hmm.. feels like I havnt got all this right now :P Is this information i got from blkid an actual text file somewhere? If :  Where is that located?
[00:10] <Feedhurley> by the way is it this hard to make new partitions in linux? o.O
[00:10] <Stephini> didn't find partitioning that hard when i used gparted about 5 years back...heh
[00:10] <ubuntu-tester> Feedhurley: you need to edit /etc/fstab as root, remove last lines
[00:11] <ubuntu-tester> Feedhurley: it's easy with gparted
[00:12] <ubuntu-tester> machicola: parse uptime output, if LA above some threshold wait 30 sec, etc.
[00:13] <machicola> what is LA?

[00:13] <ubuntu-tester> machicola: load average
[00:13] <Rienzilla> hmm
[00:14] <Rienzilla> what is responsible for starting/activating lvm volumes in ubuntu?
[00:14] <machicola> ok thanks ubuntu-tester
[00:14] <hiuser> hi, i have difficulties installing the ubuntu windows installer. the problem occures during installation. it freezes when trying to copy files. any suggestions?
[00:15] <Stephini> is it just me or is there a lack of current information on using x360 controllers on linux?
[00:17] <daftykins> Stephini: i must say that's not exactly a priority when it comes to OS's :>
[00:18] <Feedhurley> ubuntu-tester hmm how to get there, i need to be super user? So i then i have to do it terminal, but in terminal it denies me access even if i type "sudo cd root"
[00:18] <Wulf> hi
[00:18] <Feedhurley> ubuntu-tester apparently not, it was in gparted all this stuff got started
[00:18] <Wulf> The 12.04 login screens shows me only the default user to which I can login. How can I configure it so I can enter the username I'd like to login as?
[00:19] <Feedhurley> ubuntu-tester i mabye should tell that these partitions does not hold any files at all so if there is any easy gparted way which i missed I could just delete them
[00:19] <Stephini> for a gamer being able to play their games generally is a priority. for a game dev being able to test their games generally is. getting the x360 pad working factors into both. so it may not be for you or for the ubuntu dev team. but figuring out why every guide does work is for me.
[00:20] <Stephini> why every guide does not*
[00:20] <arashmousavi_> I found out the inode information of the most important directory of my server was corrupted, and I couldn't access its files. how can I recover my data in this directory? or repair its inode information? that is realy important
[00:21] <ogist> daftykins: yeah
[00:21] <ogist> well ubuntu is like a mac
[00:22] <ogist> im using cairo-dock
[00:22] <ubuntu-tester> Feedhurley: you need to start text editor with root privileges, it is done with sudo command. type in terminal: sudo gedit /etc/fstab
[00:22] <ubuntu-tester> !sudo | Feedhurley
[00:22] <ubottu> Feedhurley: sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[00:22] <Ben64> Stephini: you need the wireless connector thingy
[00:23] <Stephini> ben64 have it. but cant get the software to use it...every guide leads me to "cant locate package"
[00:23] <daftykins> ogist: nooo no no no no
[00:23] <Ben64> Stephini: what package
[00:23] <ubuntu-tester> Feedhurley: after you clean up fstab and check partitions are not mounted, you can freely delete them and create anew
[00:24] <verm1n> Hello, I am running ubuntu 12.10 with Kubuntu packages with KDE, compiz and emerald. I was wondering if it is possible for me to install some of the older compiz plugins (namely "blur").
[00:24] <Stephini> xpad and xboxdrv are teh 2 i've been sent to get by guides
[00:24] <Ben64> Stephini: what version of ubuntu are you on
[00:24] <Stephini> 12.10 i believe. latest full feature/limited support
[00:25] <usr13> ubuntu-tester:  gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
[00:25] <Ben64> Stephini: then the driver is already in the kernel
[00:25] <Stephini> ahh how can i test and config it then?
[00:25] <verm1n> anyone have success setting up advanced compiz plugins on 12.04?
[00:25] <Ben64> what happens when you do "lsmod | grep xpad"
[00:25] <ubuntu-tester> usr13: yes, will work as well
[00:26] <verm1n> 12.04/12.10
[00:27] <ubuntu-tester> verm1n: I had in 12.10, what plugins
[00:27] <Stephini> ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ lsmod | grep xpad
[00:27] <Stephini> xpad                   17756  0

[00:27] <jgodbout1> I could install the broadcom wireless driver when I was using the live CD, but now that I have installed 12.04, it does not appear in the list of additional drivers.
[00:27] <Ben64> Stephini: it should be working then
[00:27] <jgodbout1> How can I use the CD as a source to install additional drivers? (no ethernet port)
[00:27] <Stephini> ok is there a gui window where i can test inputs then?
[00:28] <verm1n> ubuntu-tester: blur
[00:28] <bekks> jgodbout1: which additional drivers do you look for?
[00:28] <Ben64> i don't know that much about xbox controllers on ubuntu
[00:28] <verm1n> maybe aquarius etc
[00:28] <jgodbout1> bekks: Broadcom STA i think
[00:28] <ubuntu-tester> jgodbout1: you can add it in Software Sources
[00:28] <jgodbout1> bekks: I forget the exact name of the one that showed up in the live cd
[00:29] <jgodbout1> ubuntu-tester: That worked. Thank you!

[00:30] <elfer> satan?
[00:31] <bekks> verm1n: Working fine here for years now.
[00:31] <verm1n> its so sad to see the old compiz falling apart
=== Harry is now known as Guest56477
[00:32] <ubuntu-tester> verm1n: sorry don't have it
[00:32] <verm1n> ubuntu-tester: have you been able to install any experimental plugins at all?
[00:32] <_helios_> what wine package should I install to use that dumb itunes program?
[00:33] <ubuntu-tester> verm1n: but Google shows than blur is incompatible with latest versions of compiz
[00:33] <ubuntu-tester> verm1n: *that
[00:33] <daftykins> _helios_: there's no need to use itunes at all.
[00:33] <k1l> _helios_: take a look into the appdb from wine
[00:33] <ubuntu-tester> verm1n: see https://answers.launchpad.net/compiz/+question/213658
[00:33] <_helios_> daftykins, then how am I to sync songs to my ipod touch 4g with xubuntu 12.10 ?
[00:34] <shell_> Anybody familiar with ubuntu irssi?
[00:34] <daftykins> !ipod | _helios_
[00:34] <ubottu> _helios_: For information on how to sync and add tracks to your iPod, see the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IPodHowto - For the iPhone and the iPod Touch, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone - See !RockBox for information on liberating your iPod
[00:34] <bekks> daftykins: Besides the fact that setting up a new iPhone requires iTunes.
[00:34] <daftykins> shell_: sup?
[00:34] <k1l> !irssi | shell_
[00:34] <ubottu> shell_: irssi is a terminal based IRC client. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Irssi for help. See also !screen
[00:34] <daftykins> bekks: used to be true, hasn't for ages afaik
[00:34] <bekks> daftykins: Still try, two weeks ago :)
[00:34] <bekks> true even.
[00:34] <k1l> daftykins: the new i-devices are not reverse engenered so far
[00:35] <daftykins> bekks: shouldn't be the case with newest iOS. otherwise, sucks to be $whoever.
[00:35] <shell_> hey daftykins, um just having trouble switching back to channels. It says things like "act: 1,3
[00:35] <daftykins> also owned for buying Apple
[00:35] <bekks> daftykins: IS the case with latest iOS.
[00:35] <daftykins> shell_: sure, hit alt+<number> where <number> is a number
[00:35] <shell_> Ah thank you.
[00:35] <_helios_> daftykins, i'll give it a try thanks.
[00:35] <daftykins> shell_: also, "/win x" when using a terminal emulator that doesn't support the alt combos
[00:36] <daftykins> bekks: bit persistent aren't we?
[00:36] <bekks> daftykins: No, I am just stating the facts :)
[00:36] <daftykins> mm-hmm. unpleasantly
[00:37] <Kireji> where else besides ~/.ssh/ does Ubuntu manage ssh keys?  some internal db anywhere?
[00:37] <Stephini> wewt managed to test it once i found out the device name...now if only i could turn off the blinking light. thanx for the help mate.
[00:37] <bekks> Kireji: No, nowhere else.
[00:37] <Stephini> sorry for my newbishness
[00:37] <Kireji> I need to delete an ssh key, can't find where it is
[00:37] <Kireji> bekks: I've found it before I know there is some command line program I ran, and it listed keys
[00:37] <ubuntu-tester> Kireji: gnome-keyring maybe
[00:39] <machicola> is there anyway I can specify exactly when I want a script to run in the order of processes at bootup?
[00:39] <Kireji> ubuntu-tester: possibly, but not in history

[00:40] <digitalslave> so i updated from 12.04 which had random X crashes when watching media in a browser to 12.10 and now web pages hang and studder on my 30M down connection. Anyone know how to correct this? i already have ipv6 disabled in sysctl and blacklisted in modprobe
[00:40] <ubuntu-tester> Kireji: what history?
[00:40] <dr_willis> machicola: the upstart docs and cookbook site will detail that
[00:40] <digitalslave> happens with chrome and firefox
[00:41] <johnnyapplewood> ubuntu can write to NTFS drives right??
[00:41] <daftykins> yes.
[00:41] <johnnyapplewood> good
[00:41] <daftykins> for several years now
[00:41] <johnnyapplewood> i gotta install a 2TB hard drive and copy my data onto it
[00:41] <johnnyapplewood> never tried
[00:41] <dr_willis> johnnyapplewood: yes ntfs-3g can
[00:41] <johnnyapplewood> sorry for my tardiness
[00:42] <daftykins> johnnyapplewood: ok, but next time i get out the axe.
[00:42] <ubuntu-tester> Kireji: also did you mean your auth keys or host keys?
[00:43] <Guest56477> Does anyone know what application would work good for taking two dvd iso's and combining them into one iso
[00:43] <lsv> So for some time now I have not been able to find gnome-terminal using dash's search bar.  Any idea why?  I can run it by using Alt + F2 then writing 'gnome-terminal'
[00:44] <lsv> I'm running 12.04
[00:44] <machicola> dr_willis, thanks
[00:44] <ubuntu-tester> digitalslave: what sites, for example?
[00:44] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, any i can load msn.com in one tab, theverge.com in another, and yahoo.com and watch them all take ten minutes or just spin till they die
[00:45] <daftykins> digitalslave: are you using a static or dynamic private IP?
[00:45] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, usually the first tab goes and the rest get progressively worse. they might get the page layout and then take 10 minutes to display the images or just not load at all
[00:45] <digitalslave> daftykins, i am on Dynamic but it never changes
[00:46] <daftykins> digitalslave: also what is your DNS config? is your computer querying the router or hitting a service directly?
[00:46] <ubuntu-tester> digitalslave: don't know if they use Flash or HTML5. Flash may be the problem
[00:47] <ubuntu-tester> digitalslave: i mean it might be a problem with playing, not downloading
[00:47] <digitalslave> daftykins, i hit my router for dns but even changed that to different dns ips with the same result
[00:47] <daftykins> digitalslave: have you tried a clean firefox profile to see if the upgrade went quirky?
[00:47] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, but that would kill entire pages?
[00:47] <ubuntu-tester> digitalslave: sorry, did you mean video or other media
[00:47] <qxt> Why can't I download the 12.10 version of ubuntu. I keep getting the 12.04 ?
[00:48] <qxt> I don't want the LTS version.
[00:48] <digitalslave> daftykins, ill try that real quick
[00:48] <daftykins> qxt: visit releases.ubuntu.com directly

[00:49] <Rallias> So my grandma's laptop currently runs LUbuntu, but is pitifully slow at it (it eats up all her ram :/ ) What can I install that looks similar in interface but is light weight?
[00:49] <_helios_> Rallias, try xubuntu
[00:49] <qxt> daftykins thx daftykins. Works there. Funny  the official site does not give the right version.
[00:50] <Rallias> _helios_, What's it's normal memory footprint?
[00:50] <Ben64> 12.04 is pretty awesome though
[00:50] <daftykins> qxt: how odd, oh well! :) my pleasure.
[00:51] <ubuntu-tester> Rallias: how much RAM in the laptop?
[00:51] <lsv> So for some time now I have not been able to find gnome-terminal using dash's search bar.  Any idea why?  I can run it by using Alt + F2 then writing 'gnome-terminal'
[00:51] <_helios_> Rallias, I have two systems installed with xubuntu 12.1064bit one with 2gb of ram and another with 800gb of ram it seems to utilize what it can,  Good memory management.
[00:51] <Rallias> ubuntu-tester, 256 mb
[00:51] <_helios_> Rallias, not 800gb but 800mb typo lol
[00:51] <Rallias> _helios_, Yeah... my grandma's has 256 mb ram.
[00:51] <ubuntu-tester> Rallias: pityful indeed :)
[00:52] <digitalslave> daftykins, didnt help. 5 tabs open and 3 aren't displaying anything yet
[00:52] <daftykins> Rallias: if you're going for recent distros, 256MB will never cut it
[00:52] <daftykins> digitalslave: hrmm, could be a driver issue then. total guess. can you identify your network chipset and google about it?
[00:52] <digitalslave> daftykins, most of the data is there but all 5 are still spinning
[00:52] <digitalslave> daftykins, i was kinda wondering that earlier
[00:53] <Rallias> daftykins, It runs openbox without much trouble, I just don't want to teach her openbox.
[00:53] <mynick13> Rallias: something like puppylinux would work better
[00:53] <ubuntu-tester> digitalslave: what ping to these sites show?
[00:53] <digitalslave> daftykins, but everything else is blazing fast
[00:53] <digitalslave> daftykins, i do speed tests and get 30M down still
[00:53] <daftykins> local or online?
[00:53] <daftykins> hmm.
[00:53] <daftykins> try another browser then maybe
[00:54] <daftykins> for fun
[00:54] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, 12-50ms
[00:54] <ubuntu-tester> digitalslave: stable, no losses or spikes?
[00:54] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, i did speed tests and still got 30M down but it's bear to get anything to load in any browser - no spikes

[00:55] <sabgenton> is there any free for all directory you username can write to (out side of /home)?
[00:55] <daftykins> digitalslave: i'd see how it goes from a livecd/USB too
[00:56] <daftykins> sabgenton: unlikely

[00:57] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: no by default, but you can create one
[00:57] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, i had 12-15ms response to google.com for a good hour earlier and was still getting it i could watch the pings come in constant while the browser stalled

[00:57] <hippiehacker> is there a way to use grub-pc to install grub-pc onto a usb stick while booted on a system with grub-efi intalled without having to remove grub-efi?
[00:58] <ubuntu-tester> digitalslave: if you have problems with msn, you should ping msn, not google
[00:58] <sabgenton> what is the most readable to all directorys then
[00:58] <sabgenton>  /user/share  i guess?
[00:58] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: yes, for example
[00:59] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, i have problems with all sites - like i said i load up 5-6 sites and it takes 10 minutes to finish loading and a few of them may just die off
[00:59] <dr_willis> sabgenton:  what are you trying to acomplish exactly?
[00:59] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, msn.com doesnt ping back - you need a host that will echo
[01:00] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: well what about 1-2-3 sites, better?
[01:00] <sabgenton> dr_willis: just puting things where all users can see them I guess I dont need write
[01:00] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, other device in my house work just fine
[01:00] <sabgenton> dr_willis: is nobody:nogroup good for that sorta thing?
[01:00] <dr_willis> sabgenton:  'things' ? ;)  what sortof things.. you  could make a directory anywhere and link it to /media/SharedStuff for example
[01:01] <sabgenton> dr_willis: what should I chmod it as
[01:01] <dr_willis> depends on the exact details - read only i think is 644, id have to double check..
[01:02] <dr_willis> !permissions
[01:02] <ubottu> An explanation of what file permissions are and how they can be manipulated can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
[01:02] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: other devices are connected through same router? some routers may limit number of simultaneous active connections
[01:02] <sabgenton> or root:root is find...
[01:02] <sabgenton> dr_willis: sorry I mean group owner
[01:02] <sabgenton> find=fine
[01:02] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: sorry, that was for digitalslave :)
[01:02] <dr_willis> dont confuse owner with permissions. :)  you can  let people READ stuff with just permissions
[01:02] <dr_willis> Got a job.. bb in a while..
[01:03] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, yes the router and cable modem have been tested and all devices go though both.
[01:03] <ubuntu-tester> digitalslave: OK, next guess: do you have firewall set up?
[01:04] <digitalslave> ubuntu-tester, no firewall on the box just on the router and that has not changed since the ubuntu upgrade
[01:04] <sabgenton> dr_willis: ok so just leave the group as root then I guess
[01:05] <ubuntu-tester> digitalslave: and problems started after upgrade?
[01:05] <sabgenton> as root will have to create it in the first place
[01:05] <mittenchops> I subscribe to canonical support, but haven't been able to access the support portal since they changed it in late November.
[01:05] <fellayaboy> hey wheres the option in compiz manager to select an area of the screen to take a screenshot
[01:05] <digitalslave> yeah internet was lightning fast on 12.04 but 12.10 its a nightmare although i'm not have the X crashes like i was in 12.04
[01:05] <unreal82> sabgenton: remember to use chmod to grant read only permissions to the folder you're creating. And yes, use root to create the directory, and give sole ownership to yourself.
[01:06] <sabgenton> unreal82: er do you mean root:root   or  like root:me        or change to me:me
[01:06] <doctorly> what is the best way to scroll up in tty?
[01:07] <sabgenton> shift page up
[01:07] <unreal82> I'd create a group for read only, and make root own it. like so root:<others>
[01:07] <fellayaboy> is there anyway i can select an area of my screen to take a screen shot???
[01:07] <doctorly> that doesnt work for me
[01:07] <sabgenton> are you in screen?
[01:07] <doctorly> nope, just tty
[01:08] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: you better create top directory as root, chown to yourself, and place files as yourself, giving read permissions to others. don't work too mush as root
[01:08] <fellayaboy> i mean the desktop...the X windows and all that regular gui i mean
[01:08] <doctorly> that was the first thing I ttried
[01:08] <sabgenton> doctorly: well thats the nummber one way to do it
[01:08] <fellayaboy> i wanna take a picture of my desktop but a section of it
[01:08] <ubuntu-tester> unreal82: didnt' see your answer :)
[01:09] <sabgenton> if you've learnt screen you that and I think crtl-esc then just use arrows
[01:09] <fellayaboy> i remember with older compiz there was an option to take a screenshot and u can just hight and select
[01:09] <doctorly> I am just in regular tty and it wont scroll up, its off
[01:10] <sabgenton> ubuntu-tester: so  sudo mkdir /bla  ; chown me:me             and so on ?
[01:11] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: yes, i'd add () around for sure
[01:13] <sabgenton> doctorly: if shift page up doesn't scroll somthings non standerd but if you type screen go in to a screen session you can then Ctrl+a  <ESC>  to scroll with keys
[01:13] <sabgenton> <ESC> again to end
[01:13] <sabgenton> scrolling
[01:14] <machicola> how do i list directories only in the terminal
[01:14] <ubuntu-tester> machicola: ls
[01:14] <machicola> that lists files & directories
[01:16] <sabgenton> doctorly: another screen trick is use [ instead of esc  then <enter>select text <enter>   then ctrl+A    ]   to paste
[01:16] <sabgenton> well esc or [ are the same
[01:16] <singharkirat> I installed ubuntu 11.10 on lenovo thinkstation s20
[01:17] <singharkirat> I need some help..
[01:17] <brecker> hi, I need to recover some files from two ssd that where hooked up as a raid on a sony notebook with win 7, if i get those darn micro sata adaptors, does anyone know if I should I be able to mount it on a different machine running ubuntu as a deprecated raid and access its files? I'm not really sure if the raid was software or hardware based yet
[01:17] <sabgenton> ubuntu-tester: ok thanks,  why subshell?  ( )
[01:17] <daftykins> brecker: RAID 0 or 1?
[01:18] <brecker> daftykins: i think it is raid 0
[01:18] <singharkirat> Any one? I need help for ubuntu 11.10 ubuntu.....
[01:18] <brecker> daftykins: looking online atm
[01:18] <daftykins> brecker: i think that'd be a really bad idea to try and use Linux for, if for example - the RAID is provided by an intel chipset (motherboard based)
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[01:19] <mittenchops> Are the PPAs that Steam linux recommends safe?  ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates?
[01:19] <brecker> daftykins: both ssd's are common 1.8" toshiba ssd's, sony doesn't give much hint on it, still looking
[01:20] <daftykins> brecker: ah it's one of those factory provided RAID configs in a sony laptop?
[01:20] <brecker> daftykins:  Intel® ICH8M-E/ICH9M-E/5 Series SATA RAID Controller Driver
[01:20] <brecker> daftykins: yes
[01:21] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: to be sure both commands will run as root. {} is better i see
[01:21] <psusi> brecker, it's fake raid.. you will need to plug in both disks and install the dmraid package to recognize it
[01:21] <daftykins> brecker: yeah i wouldn't recommend trying to gain access from a Linux, unless you see the volume perfectly at boot
[01:22] <psusi> brecker, you might want to peruse wiki.ubuntu.com/FakeRaidHowto
[01:22] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: no {} doesn't work :)
[01:22] <sabgenton> I don't think you can 'sudo' a subshell
[01:22] <psusi> brecker, why do you need to recover externally?  did the laptop die?
[01:22] <brecker> psusi: cool thanks, are there any risks? and you sure it is a fake raid?
[01:23] <psusi> brecker, yep, I'm sure
[01:23] <daftykins> brecker: it's really unlikely there'd be a true RAID controller in there.
[01:23] <sabgenton> this is the way  sudo bash -c 'mkdir /bla ; chown /bla'
[01:23] <brecker> psusi: yes, it has some electrical problems
[01:23] <psusi> brecker, well, hopefully both drives are ok
[01:23] <doctorly> sabgenton: I figured it out, if you switch to another tty session it can delete the others tail. So it just wouldnt scroll up because the tail didnt exist
[01:24] <sabgenton> ubuntu-tester: gta go thanks for the help
[01:24] <sabgenton> doctorly: for shure learn screen it doesn't have that problem :D
[01:25] <daftykins> brecker: should be alright on another intel ICHxR based chipset (i.e. ICH8R, ICH9R, ICH10R)
[01:25] <sabgenton> screen runs shells inside the shell it runs from and you do every thing in there
[01:25] <brecker> psusi: i think so, from time to time it starts for a few seconds then it dies, i think it has some bad solder / capacitor or something else that is bothering, when it starts it almost boots windows, so my guess is that they are good
=== JKL1234- is now known as _JKL1234-_
[01:26] <psusi> daftykins, doesn't have to be same chipset for Linux to recognize it.. you just won't be able to boot from it
[01:26] <daftykins> psusi: i'm recommending not allowing a Linux to look at that volume personally.
[01:27] <daftykins> psusi: but if you're sure it's fine...
[01:29] <brecker> cool, i was planning on accesing it on an amd system
[01:29] <sabgenton> doctorly: also if your bash shell crashes you you get knocked of a remote ssh session you can still get you shell with screen -r or screen -x
[01:29] <daftykins> AMD? chipset? err.
[01:29] <sabgenton> gta go bye :)
[01:30] <skeuomorf> Guys, I have a problem with my Ubuntu, it's Linux ubuntu 3.5.0-21-generic x86_64, I have installed the graphics drivers per this tutorial http://askubuntu.com/a/210565/95523 my problem is that when I shutdown or restart the computer it shows some stuff in command-line and doesn't shut down, I have to do a hard power off from the button to shut it down
[01:30] <skeuomorf> I have searched on askubuntu and google, couldn't find any solution whatsoever
[01:31] <daftykins> skeuomorf: was there something wrong with the ATI drivers ubuntu offered?
[01:31] <skeuomorf> hybrid graphics don't work and the laptop heats up all the time
[01:32] <daftykins> skeuomorf: has that guide's manual download+install solved that?
[01:33] <solrac> how do i   upgrade ubuntu from iso image?
[01:33] <daftykins> solrac: you need the alternate CD image for that. can't do it with the normal install/live one
[01:34] <dr_willis> hmm. htere is no alt-cd for 12.10   but i thought if you booted it - it would ask to upgrade
[01:34] <daftykins> i did not know that
[01:35] <dr_willis> im not sure if you can just pop in the desktop cd and it will ask to upgrade.
[01:35] <sergio> HI
[01:35] <skeuomorf> daftykins: yes, hybrid graphics now works, 2 problems exist though: 1- can't shutdown or reboot normally most of the time. 2- whenever I do apt-get upgrade, it shows me that 3 graphics packages need to be downgraded, 3 fglrx packages, I did that before and lightdm wouldn't open after it, so I unrolled all and went again per the tutorial but this time I didn't upgrade the packages
=== sergio is now known as Guest34539
[01:36] <Guest34539> i need help, i am trying to install the DIvx on my Edubuntu
[01:36] <solrac> shows me only a new installation don't know wy
[01:36] <daftykins> skeuomorf: yeah you're gonna constantly have issues with that, unless you find a way to have APT ignore the fglrx packages. as per shutdown+reboot issue, you might just have to live with it. the best idea would be to post logs of your system at shutdown/reboot and try and see what's going wrong. does it fail with both GPU 'modes' ?
[01:36] <dr_willis> Guest34539:  what 'divx' ?
[01:37] <funky> if i install gnome 3, will i be able to go back to unity? if so how?
[01:37] <dr_willis> funky:  at the login  screen, select the desktop you want to use
[01:37] <k1l> funky: yes
[01:37] <skeuomorf> daftykins: I will maybe block these packages from the update manager. and regarding the shutdown, I was thinking about trying both modes, cause I didn't give that any attention before, n00b mistake
[01:38] <Guest34539> i am trying to watch movies on this website but i need Divx in my compute
[01:38] <skeuomorf> daftykins: It fails using the intel graphics, I am sure of that
[01:38] <solrac> aaaaaaaaa let me see
[01:38] <skeuomorf> daftykins: I will try shutting down using the ATI one now and will be back
[01:38] <skeuomorf> daftykins: Thanks for your help, brb :)
[01:38] <funky> i'm folliwng this tutorial: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-get-complete-gnome-3-desktop-in.html
[01:38] <Public> hi
[01:38] <dr_willis> Guest34539:  what site and whats playing the movie? you could try installing the ubuntu-restricted-extras package.  I know of no 'divx' codec or package
[01:38] <funky> at the last step, it says sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-settings
[01:39] <Guest34539> this website  www.veehd.com
[01:39] <funky> Does that remove some of the unity components?
[01:39] <Public> does someone here know how to change the dictionnary set by default in calibre ?
[01:40] <k1l> funky: that is something different from just installing the gnome-shell
[01:40] <Public> oups
[01:40] <Guest34539> or this website too. www.freefullmovies.net
[01:40] <Public> hello
[01:40] <k1l> funky: after that tutorial you cant switch back to unity
[01:41] <Public> is it time for bed ?
[01:41] <Public> #calibre is empty :'(
[01:41] <Guest34539> dr_willis where can i install ubuntu-restricte-extra package?
[01:43] <Ziber> Is there a way I can change the default port that my ssh client tries to connect on?
[01:43] <k1l> Ziber: ssh -p portnumber
[01:43] <Ziber> Yes, but I want it to chose an alternate port (I use a non-standard port on my servers) by default.
[01:43] <dr_willis> Guest34539: its in the package manager tools
[01:44] <dr_willis> Ziber: make an alias or check into the ssh config files
[01:45] <Guest34539> okay i'll be back i am going to try that. Thank you dr_willis
[01:46] <skeuomorf> daftykins: same problem
[01:46] <skeuomorf> daftykins: with the dgpu and igpu
[01:47] <Jikan> seriously, it's a pity there's no way to have Ubuntu displaying filesizes correctly -__-
[01:48] <rushy> can anyone help me, trying to install server 12.10
[01:48] <rushy> it won't see my raid setup only individual disk's
[01:48] <bekks> rushy: Which RAID?
[01:48] <Chanshark> Jikan:  its a pity i have been trying for 3 days to get my wifi usb attachment to work
[01:48] <rushy> raid5
[01:48] <bekks> rushy: Some Mobo RAID?
[01:48] <k1l> Jikan: ?
[01:49] <rushy> yeah
[01:49] <bekks> rushy: Wontwork. Wontfix. Thats a RAID requiring Windows drivers.
[01:50] <rushy> ok so i would need to get a raid controller?
[01:50] <daftykins> Jikan: 'correctly' ?
[01:50] <Chanshark> is anyone having the same problem, they cant get their usb wireless adapter to connect
[01:50] <daftykins> skeuomorf: lames. guess you need to go log trawling!
[01:50] <bekks> rushy: Or you need to setup a software raid in Ubuntu.
[01:50] <Jikan> k1l, daftykins: IEC way, not this silly base 10 system
[01:50] <chamunks> navicat is having a hard time connecting to mysql on a ubuntu default vanilla install.
[01:50] <mrdavid> iptables question. I'm trying to open port 514 to a single ip and block it for everything else. I did "iptables -A INPUT -i venet0:0 -p tcp --dport 514 -j ACCEPT -s 1.2.3.4" and then "iptables -A INPUT -j DROP -p tcp --dport 514" connections from 1.2.3.4 are still not coming through
[01:50] <skeuomorf> daftykins: sorry, I am a bit of a n00b in linux, how can I acquire shutdown logs?
[01:51] <skeuomorf> daftykins: cause I have no idea where they're stored
[01:51] <daftykins> skeuomorf: i'm not really 100% on that either.
[01:51] <daftykins> skeuomorf: lots of stuffs in /var/log/
[01:51] <skeuomorf> daftykins: okay, thank you
[01:51] <daftykins> np!
[01:51] <Chanshark> daftykins:  i was wrong
[01:51] <Chanshark> and im mad
[01:52] <daftykins> Chanshark: er, wrong and mad regarding...?
[01:52] <Chanshark> the fing wifi adapter wont work
[01:52] <Chanshark> i have literary tried everything
[01:54] <rushy> bekks: rather not. ok so heres my next question. i'm setting up a server to run web hosting, data, dns and possibly email. its for a small business. i was told by a co-worker at my job that what they do is they have 1 disk (usually a small one) just for the OS then they run RAID for data and other stuff. If i put the os on 1 disk will i still be able to see the raid disk's afterwards if i go
[01:54] <rushy> with a different hardware raid controller?
[01:54] <brecker> psusi: basically i just need to install fakeraid and plug both hds? i was looking on how to procede with fakeraid and plug & play seems too good to be true, or at least should I have both drives connected before bootup?
[01:55] <bekks> rushy: Using a HW RAID controller, I'll just use all disks. Meanwhile, I'll just use a software raid in Ubuntu which is quite more portable.
[01:56] <psusi> brecker, doesn't matter... once you have the drives in and the dmraid package installed, it should show up in /dev/mapper/isw_blahblah
[01:56] <Chanshark> im about to give up t
[01:56] <rushy> bekks: yeah but doens't software raid slow things down? not as reliable?
[01:57] <bekks> rushy: Using a current CPU you wont even notice it.
[01:57] <brecker> psusi: cool, thanks a lot again!
[01:58] <psusi> software raid actually tends to be more reliable
[01:58] <rushy> bekks: well its an older cpu (like 4 years old)
[01:58] <psusi> and the performance difference is minimal
[01:58] <bekks> rushy: You wont notice it.
[01:59] <bekks> rushy: Even with a ten year old CPU your network will be the bottleneck when it comes to fast I/O.
[01:59] <psusi> rushy, there's also no need for a dedicated os disk
[01:59] <bekks> A dedicated OS disk introduces a single point of failure.
[01:59] <psusi> indeed
[02:00] <psusi> so better to not have one
[02:00] <bekks> psusi: ack.
[02:00] <poseidon> Is it possible to install ubuntu with no desktop environment?
[02:00] <poseidon> or without X even
[02:00] <rushy> bekks: ok now my biggest problem....i can't get any iso's to burn or to get on a USB and install the server. i did get most of it to burn on a DVD but every time i burn it says burn failed
[02:00] <bekks> poseidon: Sure.
[02:00] <Jikan> poseidon: yes
[02:00] <poseidon> I just want a base install
[02:00] <bekks> rushy: Then you have a faulty burning device.
[02:01] <rushy> bekks: even USB?
[02:01] <psusi> poseidon, sure, just not with the live cd
[02:01] <rushy> i've used 2 different usb's and still nothing
[02:01] <bekks> rushy: You do not burn things on USB.
[02:01] <Chanshark> i hate usbs
[02:01] <rushy> i know that i'm saying i can't even get a bootable usb to work
[02:02] <sporkboy> okay, I know my wireless connect used to happen before login. Now it does not. How do I change this back?
[02:02] <rushy> its doesn't even show anything. i know i can boot on the usb cause i did it with gparted but i can't get it to work
[02:02] <limpc> daftykins, you around?
[02:03] <limpc> I gave up trying to fix the ubuntu installation and decided to just reinstall clean
[02:03] <daftykins> limpc: yes sir
[02:03] <limpc> however i can't even do that.
[02:03] <daftykins> no?
[02:03] <limpc> usb dies when the installer loads
[02:03] <daftykins> limpc: did you find that PS/2 keyboard to try and check logs?
[02:03] <Chanshark> i have a different reason for a burning hatred towards usbs
[02:04] <limpc> daftykins, yeah i did, but i didn't see anything. it looked like it found usb
[02:04] <limpc> but it also says it found ethernet, but ethernet is also dead
[02:04] <daftykins> =/
[02:04] <daftykins> limpc: this was the new motherboard scenario, was it not?
[02:05] <limpc> ethernet is an r8169 chipset
[02:05] <Chanshark> daftykins:  i give up >.>
[02:05] <Guest34539> hello dr_willis   are you able to run Windows programs in your Ubuntu?
[02:05] <limpc> daftykins, new motherboard scennario?
[02:05] <daftykins> Chanshark: oh, sorry i went to get alcohol.

[02:05] <Chanshark> like its detecting it and everything
[02:06] <limpc> anyone here running ubuntu on a gigabyte 990fxa mobo?
[02:06] <daftykins> limpc: i'm not sure what your last problem was, i've kinda forgotten ;x
[02:06] <Chanshark> it just does not want to i really just have no flipping idea what im doing
[02:06] <daftykins> Chanshark: so you get an interface up?
[02:06] <limpc> hm i didn't have a last problem, i haven't been in here except for this issue
[02:06] <Chanshark> would wine do the trick?
[02:06] <daftykins> Chanshark: dear god no
[02:06] <daftykins> wine doesn't do drivers
[02:06] <Chanshark> f
[02:06] <Chanshark> well time to go get 5 bottles of it
[02:07] <limpc> doesn't it with ndiswrapper?
[02:07] <Chanshark> yes
[02:07] <daftykins> limpc: oh so before it was stopping after an upgrade, now it's not booting live?
[02:07] <Chanshark> but newest version of ubuntu and mint broke it
[02:07] <limpc> daftykins, no that was probably someone else.  my problem was from installing a brand new mono and trying to boot up my existing ubuntu os (since both were gigabyte boards i figured they should be ok)
[02:08] <limpc> it boots fine but no USB support, no Ethernet
[02:08] <brecker> psusi: last question, would usb adapters work or I need to connect them to sata ports?
[02:08] <limpc> dmesg shows it finds ethernet
[02:08] <limpc> no errors that i could see
[02:08] <daftykins> limpc: ah so i was right, mobo swap situ
[02:08] <daftykins> mmk
[02:09] <daftykins> limpc: any major differences between new and old?
[02:09] <limpc> oh ok i thought you meant like software or driver upgrade
[02:09] <limpc> well they're pretty far apart. old one is about 3 years old - new one is the latest and greatest from Gigabyte
[02:09] <limpc> old one didn't support more than 8gb ram
[02:09] <Guest34539> but is many types of Wine like wine-gecko1.4, wine1.4-amd64, gnome-exe, wine1.2, wine1.4-dbg, wine1.4-common wine1.2, wine1.3 i dont know which one?
[02:10] <Chanshark> is there wine made for chanshark because he is about to cry because he has been trying to get wifi to work for 3 days now
[02:10]  * daftykins gifts Chanshark a virtualbox installed dl for Windows
[02:11] <daftykins> *installer
[02:11] <Chanshark> :D
[02:12] <limpc> i bet windows will install on this mono :P
[02:12] <limpc> mobo
[02:12] <daftykins> afaik he has Windows and wireless working ;D
[02:12] <daftykins> that's the best part!
[02:12] <psusi> brecker, usb adapters will work
[02:12] <limpc> anyone here running ubuntu on a gigabyte 990fxa mobo?

[02:16] <daftykins> still huh
[02:16] <daftykins> and you deffo 'make' 'd and 'make install' 'd?
[02:16] <Chanshark> huh
[02:17] <Chanshark> i used package manager to install it
[02:17] <daftykins> limpc: sorry if this is too obvious. have you seen: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12447480
[02:17] <daftykins> Chanshark: er, the guide said you have to compile ndiswrapper from source to avoid the bug.
[02:17] <ubuntu-tester> otend: ntfs if you plan sharing content with Windows machines
[02:17] <Chanshark> so do i need to remove the ndiswrapper
[02:17] <otend> nope
[02:18] <Chanshark> is that nope directed at me?
[02:18] <otend> I don't have anything against Windows machines, but I wouldn't leave them to watch my children
[02:18] <otend> nah, at ubuntu-tester
[02:18] <Chanshark> oh
[02:18] <daftykins> Chanshark: yeah kill it with fire, download latest ndiswrapper source, compile + install, try again
[02:18] <Chanshark> well i had downloaded a bunch

[02:20] <otend> true
[02:20] <limpc> daftykins, hmm no i hadn't seen that. though i saw that a lot of people were having problems with it.  hmm
[02:20] <Chanshark> what i had installed was ndiswrapper-scourse, ndiswrapper-dkms, ndiswrapper-ultils-1.9, ndiswrapper-common

[02:20] <limpc> i just confirmed it does work on the usb 3.0 ports.

[02:20] <Chanshark> *source
[02:20] <otend> and caused the death of my Seagate external
[02:20] <daftykins> limpc: looks like the chipset doesn't work well with Linux in general.
[02:20] <cjae> so what happens when you have firefox and chrome on the same machine and ff has flash 11.2 and chrome  wants higher version
[02:21] <limpc> I've always had gigabyte motherboards - for some 12 years. never had this problem
[02:21] <limpc> strange.
[02:21] <Chanshark> otend:  my seagate external 50 tb death was caused by they left i a screw in the middle and it shorted it
[02:21] <daftykins> limpc: it's an AMD chipset. that's instant alarm bells to me ;x
[02:21] <otend> oof
[02:21] <bentinata> cjae, nothing
[02:21] <daftykins> though i haven't run AMD in years
[02:21] <limpc> pfft
[02:22] <Chanshark> i use floppy disk as storage :D
[02:22] <limpc> I've been on AMD since my first dual cpu Athlon II
[02:22] <limpc> or was it Athlon MP.. i can't remember heh
[02:22] <compdoc>  limpc, are you having netowrk and usb problems?
[02:22] <otend> I eat disk space like mad
[02:22] <limpc> compdoc, yea
[02:22] <Chanshark> so uh daftykins which of the list do i uninstall
[02:23] <limpc> though I've likely found the solution (though not a very fun one)
[02:23] <compdoc> limpc, in the bios, disable IMMOU, or however thats spelt
[02:23] <Chanshark> i found a solution for disk space :D
[02:23] <cjae> bentinata: well wont two versions of flash not work on a machine?
[02:23] <daftykins> Chanshark: probly anything related to ndiswrapper
[02:23] <limpc> compdoc, in which section of the bios, and what is it?
[02:23] <bentinata> cjae, no, that's fine
[02:23] <cjae> bentinata: how will package manager handle it
[02:24] <fireshibby> here's a quick question, I'm running Ubuntu 11.10, and It's on a failing laptop hard drive xD any gustimations on how long I have?
[02:24] <bentinata> cjae, install the flash player inside the browser
[02:24] <Chanshark> uuh yea daftykins its not letting me remove it
[02:24] <fiveofoh> Umm, yesterday?  The OS doesn't have much to do with failing hard drive life
[02:24] <compdoc> limpc, I dont remember. After setting up my Gigabyte board a couple of months ago, I havent messed with it much. Does it boot to the desktop ok?
[02:24] <fiveofoh> Find yourself a backup drive and get on it :P
[02:24] <daftykins> Chanshark: don't look at me!
[02:24] <bentinata> cjae, just try it! ;)
[02:25] <fireshibby> I have an external that I save my stuff on :p but i've been running on the failing drive for at least 4 months
[02:25] <compdoc> limpc, oh, it has do to with hardware passthru for virtual machines
[02:25] <limpc> yes it does
[02:25] <Chanshark> it says if i uninstall it, it will remove mint-meta-core mintwifi ndisgtk ndiswrapper-dkms
[02:25] <cjae> bentinata: i c,
[02:25] <Guest34539> which Wine do i have to install, since is many of them, like this one, Wine-gecko1, gecko1.4, wine1.4amd64 or wine1.4 common, wine1.2, wine1.2, wine1.3?
[02:25] <cmj141> hi
[02:25] <johnnyapplewood> probably a really stupid question... is it possible to extend partition sizes across drives (without using RAID)?
[02:25] <fiveofoh> Well yeah, that's the nature of failing HD, you're running on borrowed time.  As long as you're well-backed-up, I guess wait until it fails and replace it
[02:25] <fiveofoh> Or replace it now if you can
[02:26] <johnnyapplewood> i have a 2TB drive in my machine plus a 500GB and I dont want to lose data but i'd like to extend them across each other
[02:26] <fireshibby> my uncle said he has a spare drive he's gonna give to me, it's all up to when I can meet up with him.
[02:26] <fiveofoh> Hey all.  Just upgraded to 12.04, which uses PHP 5.3.10, which has a critical-to-me that wasn't fixed until 5.3.11.  Don't want to upgrade to 5.4 yet because it threw all kinds of errors...what are my options?
[02:26] <fiveofoh> *critical-to-me bug
[02:26]  * fireshibby cant update to 12.04 
[02:26] <cmj141> question, if you download and zip from the internet and extract it yourself.. how does one create a shortcut say in the window manager?
[02:26] <johnnyapplewood> downgrade
[02:26] <bentinata> johnnyapplewood, your nickname is too long
[02:26] <fiveofoh> Downgrade my OS, or can I just download PHP?
[02:27] <fiveofoh> *downgrade
[02:27] <Chanshark> so yea daftykins how do i compile it from the source because incase this crashes my interwebz
[02:27] <limpc> compdoc, mine is already disabled
[02:27] <johnnyapplewood> if u can find the old version of PHP just downgrade that
[02:27] <compdoc> shucks
[02:27] <cjae> bentinata: it was just lingering around in my head, as I am a ff fanman and hate to see what is happening...
[02:27] <johnnyapplewood> u'll need to purge the current one first
[02:27] <daftykins> Chanshark: well the bug page had a guide, maybe save that locally?
[02:27] <fiveofoh> There aren't any available versions previously in the precise repos, but can I add a previous version's repo and force the version?
[02:27] <Chanshark> where is it again
[02:28] <bentinata> cjae, I'm a FF fan too xD
[02:28] <daftykins> Chanshark: er say 'bug ###' and it'll link you
[02:28] <compdoc> limpc, search your manual for "PCI Latency Timer" does that exist in yours?
[02:28] <Chanshark> bug ###
[02:28] <ubuntu-tester> cmj141: shortcut for what, program, doc?
[02:28] <Chanshark> errrr
[02:28] <Guest34539> can someone help me with my question, since is many of the Wine to install i dont know which to install?
[02:28] <fiveofoh> I could also compile from source and checkinstall, but I don't know what configure options Ubuntu uses and don't want to break them
[02:28] <bentinata> Guest34539, I use wine1.5

[02:29] <cjae> bentinata: kind of harsh thing to happen to a path clearing company
[02:29] <ubuntu-tester> johnnyapplewood: extending is possible with lvm but you have to move data somewhere temporarily
[02:30] <daftykins> Chanshark: the hashes need to be the bug number ;)
[02:30] <johnnyapplewood> blehs...
[02:30] <Chanshark> how do i know what the bug number is...
[02:30] <johnnyapplewood> sigh.. gonna have to find my external drive now :-(
[02:30] <compdoc> limpc, hopefully youve downloaded the manual in pdf
[02:30] <aj_> after i've hit ctrl alt f1 ... what do i type to get back to the desktop ?
[02:31] <bentinata> aj_, alt+f7
[02:31] <Chanshark> johnnyapplewood:  i have a cloud in my house, so i gess you could say my house is foggy he he he
[02:31] <aj_> thank you bentinata
[02:31] <johnnyapplewood> a cloud in your house? by definition a cloud is not on a LAN
[02:31] <bentinata> aj_, you're welcome :)
[02:31] <johnnyapplewood> otherwise it's a NAS
[02:31] <johnnyapplewood> or possibly just a share
[02:31] <Chanshark> i have a server room with 601 tb disk space
[02:31] <johnnyapplewood> 601?
[02:32] <Chanshark> yes 601 tb
[02:32] <johnnyapplewood> how did you get 601?
[02:32] <johnnyapplewood> that's an odd number
[02:32] <johnnyapplewood> you have 601 x 1TB drives?
[02:32] <Chanshark> well there is a 1tb drive in there lol
[02:32] <Chanshark> + 600tb
[02:32] <ubuntu-tester> cmj141: in Nautilus context menu for a file choose Make Link, then move link to desktop

[02:57] <hplc> odd, i get weird notes in my FW logs regarding port, its not a single port number but in format "80>800" any ideas what this means?
[02:57] <Thalen> Hey WaY
[02:57] <bentinata> WaY, hello
[02:58] <WaY> does anybody knows if there is a linux distribution for Intel Atom processors? like Raspbian for Raspberry?
[02:58] <bentinata> Thalen, hey thats rhyme
[02:58] <Thalen> Huh?
[02:58] <fireshibby> Thalen sounds like an epic name for a story character.
[02:59]  * fireshibby steals it and gives credit in the little notes in the beginning
[02:59] <Thalen> I thought I was being clever back when I was 13,
[02:59] <Thalen> But I've read like 3 fantasy novels that use it since then, Alas.

[03:00] <Thalen> Feel free to use it lol.
[03:00] <WaY> mmm, but meego is almost dead, isn't it?

[03:06] <Ben64> bentinata: whats up?
[03:06] <WaY> and the cpu is idle all time
[03:06] <Chanshark> the sky!
[03:06] <Chanshark> oh i have been waiting to say that joke all day Ben64
[03:06] <ubuntu-tester> WaY: i don't think you can solve drivers' problems by changing distros

[03:07] <WaY> I was thinking on installing windows 7, because of the drivers
[03:07] <bentinata> Ben64, WaY has problem setting-up nvidia ion 2 driver
[03:07] <bentinata>  
[03:07] <Chanshark> wait ben are you good with setting up drivers?

[03:07] <Chanshark> ok i really need help installing my wifi drivers
[03:08] <Chanshark> i have spent 3 days trying to install them
[03:08] <WaY> I've got setup the driver and I'm using the vdpau lib, so the CPU is not working hard in decode the film
[03:08] <Chanshark> its a netgear n600 wireless dual band usb adapter WNDA3100v2
[03:08] <WaY> but sometimes I see a little jump between scenes
[03:08] <Ben64> WaY: there probably isn't much to be done with that, that chip is very limited
[03:09] <WaY> but ion2 it is supposed to works fine with 1080p

[03:15] <Chanshark> im not realy sure how to tell
[03:15] <ubuntu-tester> hplc: well it's ubuntu channel not IPFire
[03:15] <Chanshark> or would it be better to just run a eithernet cabble

[03:15] <ubuntu-tester> hplc: Wiki tells it's not even Debian-based

[03:17] <Chanshark> home depot
[03:17] <_SKiTZO> most of the time it runs smooth, but when i perform certain actions like open a file save dialogue in certain apps it locks up

[03:17] <_SKiTZO> for a short time
[03:17] <_SKiTZO> really annoying.
[03:17] <_SKiTZO> any hints?

[03:18] <escott> fireshibby, you should also verify that your graphics drivers are working and see if you need to mess around with nomodeset
[03:19] <Ben64> escott: usually updates work fine
[03:19] <ubuntu-tester> _SKiTZO: does hdd flash in that moments?
[03:19] <fireshibby> My graphics drivers run fantastically, i have a Dell Inspiron 1520 with an nVidia graphcs driver and i've had no problems
[03:19] <_SKiTZO> ubuntu-tester: yes the hd light often is very active
[03:19] <escott> fireshibby, you will probably need nomodeset since it is nvidia
[03:20] <fireshibby> ok. Think it would run fine then afterwards?

[03:22] <_SKiTZO> ubuntu-tester: will a ps aux do?
[03:22] <ubuntu-tester> _SKiTZO: maybe your system thrashes on memory
[03:22] <escott> _SKiTZO, perhaps fsync is having to wait on both disks to finish their writes
[03:22] <_SKiTZO> yes. memory usage is not extensive

[03:23] <_SKiTZO> ill see if i can provoke it
[03:24] <sabgenton> ubuntu-tester: hey (again) what do you think of nobody:nogroup   vs me:me for general shares?
[03:24] <ubuntu-tester> what drives in raid? same model/size?
[03:25] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: think it's bad idea
[03:25] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: create another user if you want
[03:25] <sabgenton> well the files I'm shareing are for everyone thats all
[03:26] <sabgenton> ah ok fair enough
[03:26] <escott> sabgenton, nobody:users might make more sense
[03:26] <sabgenton> ubuntu-tester: what is a good situation to use nobody  or nogroup out of interest?
[03:27] <sabgenton> or is it generally seen as a bad idea theses days
[03:27] <escott> sabgenton, usually applications set their effective uid to nobody/nogroup to deny themselves access to the filesystem
[03:27] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: nobody meant to have no rights and no property on the system at all, including files
[03:28] <sabgenton> escott: but then if you break into nobody you control those apps!
[03:28] <escott> sabgenton, so
[03:28] <ubuntu-tester> sabgenton: some daemons downgrade its privileges to nobody to minimize security risks
[03:29] <limpc> so, i installed drivers for my ethernet's r8168 chipset manually. however i still can't get internet :(
[03:30] <limpc> lspci shows ethernet, the light is on on the ethernet jack (active connection), lsmod shows the r8168 loaded
[03:30] <limpc> i don't know wtf more to do
[03:30] <kepler> ifconfig see it?
[03:30] <daftykins> ifconfig -a got an interface?
[03:30] <bazhang> r8168-dkms   limpc this? from the repos?
[03:31] <ubuntu-tester> limpc: or look for it in network manager
[03:31] <limpc> yes ifconfig sees it
[03:31] <daftykins> limpc: is the interface up? 'sudo dhclient eth0' if it's eth0
[03:31] <limpc> bazhang, no i downloaded it direct from realtek and used their autorun.sh to install (which was successful)
[03:32] <daftykins> or statically address
[03:32] <limpc> dhcp refused to fetch an address, so i defined a static one with the correct gateway (i had this on a static ip before anyway)
[03:32] <daftykins> ping success?
[03:32] <limpc> no
[03:32] <limpc> i can't ping 192.168.1.1
[03:32] <daftykins> =/
[03:32] <limpc> i don't get it.
[03:33] <ubuntu-tester> limpc: pastebin ifconfig, route -n
[03:33] <limpc> um ..
[03:34] <limpc> pate bin requires internet :P
[03:34] <limpc> er pastebin. stupid autocorrection
[03:34] <savagecroc> I'm running a production webserver which will be running nginx/ruby/postgres.  How often should i run apt-get update, what's the chances of it breaking stuff when i do? what's a good way of testing and making sure updates work?
[03:34] <ubuntu-tester> oh yes, IRC doesn't, how could I forget!
[03:34] <limpc> I'm on another computer here.
[03:35] <escott> savagecroc, as often as you have time to fix it if it does or as often as you are willing to have downtime if you cant
[03:35] <Sna4x8> I have the most annoying bug.  On one of my computers (happens to be my main development machine) vim doesn't refresh.  SSHing and using vim on the same machine works fine though.  Is that a video card issue most likely?
[03:35] <ubuntu-tester> limpc: flash drive?
[03:35] <limpc> no, usb doesn't work either
[03:36] <limpc> apparently theres an issue with the ubuntu stock kernel and GA-990FXA mobos
[03:36] <ubuntu-tester> limpc: how can you be sure
[03:36] <limpc> because I've been here for hours and people have helped figure out the issue(s) :P
[03:37] <limpc> usb only works for usb 3.0, the 2.0 ports are not working.  I have mouse/kbd on the 2 usb 3.0 ports provided by the mobo
[03:37] <ubuntu-tester> limpc: ok then i give up
[03:38] <limpc> you just want a paste bin to confirm that eth1 has an ip / route / net mask configured yes?
[03:38] <limpc> they are there and configured. I verified that
[03:38] <escott> limpc, have you tried setting it up as a patch cable to another machine running wireshark
[03:38] <leidner> nite nite
[03:39] <savagecroc> escott: ok.. so pretty much i have to expect that it might break stuff and test
[03:39] <ubuntu-tester> limpc: yes, ok. if you suspect drivers then take escott's advice
[03:40] <savagecroc> escott: for security purposes thought.. what's ok.. once a month, once every 6 months?
[03:40] <escott> savagecroc, depends on what "production" means. if your production machine goes does do you get fired? do people die? would either of those outcomes bother you?
[03:40] <ubuntu-tester> limpc: and watch dmesg in the process
[03:40] <ubuntu-tester> limpc: maybe tcpdump will do instead of wireshark
[03:41] <escott> savagecroc, for security purposes i guess the question is what is on those machines and what happens if you get hacked? does the company lose billions of dollars? do terrorists get nuclear weapons? would either of those outcomes bother you?
[03:41] <savagecroc> escott: yeah i can work out times of day when people are using most of the system.. or failing that i can just clone the entire vm and test separatly and then change them over
[03:41] <escott> savagecroc, its entirely too vague to answer the question in any meaningful sense
[03:42] <escott> savagecroc, i do updates on my desktop 2-3 times a week. maybe once every two months i will have a minor issue.
[03:42] <ubuntu-tester> savagecroc: testing on separate machine/virtual is a good way. also prod servers are usually reserved
[03:42] <savagecroc> i'm trying to get some guage at how often good sysadmins update their systems.  i'm running a webapp with 10,000 users but with no particular strategic value for most people (although maybe people would want to steal our code)
[03:43] <savagecroc> ubuntu-tester: i could move the database onto a separate server, then that way i can have two machines connecting to the same DB
=== kieran_ is now known as Thalen
[03:44] <savagecroc> ubuntu-tester: then i can just setup my local hostfile to connect to the new machine and make updates and take the other one out of service.. but then i'd also need to setup some sort a load balancer :/
[03:44] <savagecroc> escott: yeah the thing with desktops though, is they run a lot more stuff than most servers
[03:47] <ubuntu-tester> savagecroc: really good sysadmins make checklist with their critical apps (including kernel) and watch their security bulletins daily. and leave all other components just working, no updates. but 10k users case is probably not THAT serious
[03:50] <Guest34539> how to install or download the winehq?
[03:50] <Basil1x> 12.10-64bit Toshiba l755-s5167.  Sound says 'Dummy Output'.  Until late Dec. I have had no issues whatsoever.  Everything has worked flawlessly for over a year.  In attempting to fix this, my audio applet in the bar has disappeared.  I would like it back, and would like sound to work.
[03:50] <daftykins> Guest34539: go to #winehq
[03:52] <Guest34539> i am at this website. appdb.winehq.org  what do i have to do here/
[03:52] <bazhang> Guest34539, search with it
[03:53] <Toph2> Guest34539,,, at the top of that site, click WineHQ tab and go from there
[03:53] <ubuntu-tester> savagecroc: the problem with your approach above is that booting and wgetting main page successfully does not show problems which real traffic and real load show. so having a balancer and redirecting traffic partially for testing is good idea
[03:54] <Guest34539> i so and now it said Welcome i dont know where to go?
[03:55] <bazhang> Guest34539, use it to search if your windows app works with Wine on Ubuntu
[03:55] <savagecroc> ubuntu-tester: yeah.. we are thinking for our future project.. we want to do something like.. upgrade server on our testing cluster, test that after it passes, add one updated server to the main cluster.  Stick all the beta-tester users on it.. if there is a single error immediately take it offline and revert them back to older nodes, rinse, repeat.  When there are no errors, add a few more users.. continue until it works and then grad
[03:55] <savagecroc> ually phase out the old nodes
[03:55] <bazhang> Guest34539, IT's a Search Engine.   Use it to Search.
[03:56] <Toph2> Guest34539,,, why not download and install from Ubuntu Software Center?
=== defekt_ is now known as defekt
[03:57] <dcherniv> savagecroc, wait what?
[03:57] <dcherniv> savagecroc, on a load balancer?
[03:57] <savagecroc> dcherniv: nah nah, for a webserver behind the load-balancer
[03:57] <ubuntu-tester> Guest34539 actually you better google 'wine yourprogram problems'
[03:57] <Guest34539> also i go where it ubuntu Software Center but i dont know which one to install because it many to choose from?
[03:57] <savagecroc> load-balancer -> webservers (multiple) -> databases-servers(multiple)
[03:58] <ubuntu-tester> savagecroc: that's even better
[03:58] <dcherniv> savagecroc, what we do is, 1 storage array for all users that is mounted on the webservers over NFS
[03:58] <savagecroc> dcherniv: right, and the storage array runs on another machine?
[03:58] <dcherniv> savagecroc, that you wont have to migrate anyone anywhere, all servers share common storage
[03:58] <dcherniv> savagecroc, yes
[03:59] <ubuntu-tester> Guest34539 what's program?
[03:59] <savagecroc> we have very few user files.. nearly everything is in the postgres database
[03:59] <Guest34539> wine, Q4wine,  wine1.2 wine1.3 and more
[03:59] <dcherniv> savagecroc, if you plan for the future a separate storage server will make things easier in the long run
[04:00] <ubuntu-tester> dcherniv: ...and single bug can corrupt data for all servers at once
[04:00] <bazhang> Guest34539, what version of ubuntu are you using
[04:00] <savagecroc> i assume for storage of the database.. you would just leave the db storage on the same machine as thats running the database.. i.e. no point separting db storage and the db server
[04:00] <dcherniv> ubuntu-tester, yes but they are on the load balancer anyhow,
[04:00] <Guest34539> edubuntu 12.10
[04:00] <savagecroc> dcherniv: yeah.. you mean even if it's tiny image
[04:00] <ubuntu-tester> Guest34539 what program do you want to run under Wine?
[04:00] <savagecroc> i.e. some ubuntu box with 256mb of ram
[04:00] <bazhang> Guest34539, and what windows app do you want to use
[04:00] <dcherniv> ubuntu-tester, a single bug where?
[04:00] <Guest34539> like winamp and Divx
[04:01] <ubuntu-tester> dcherniv: in app
[04:01] <dcherniv> savagecroc, if its a tiny image why use a load balancer?
[04:01] <bazhang> Guest34539, use audacious and mplayer
[04:01] <dr_willis> divx what exactly?
[04:01] <savagecroc> dcherniv: what IP do the users connect to?
[04:01] <dcherniv> ubuntu-tester, you do snapshots of the storage server
[04:01] <sk1special> so..anyone know how i install 12.10 on windows 8 while keeping the windows boot menu?
[04:01] <bazhang> Guest34539, there is zero reason to use those with wine as Ubuntu provides Better native software apps
[04:02] <savagecroc> so lets say you have https://mybigwebapp.com it has to then decide which webserver to connnect which user too
[04:02] <Guest34539> divx is where you can play movies online like Www.veehd.com and www.freefulmovies.net
[04:02] <dcherniv> savagecroc, right
[04:02] <savagecroc> also i want to split them up so.. like these 1000 users goto this machine, these 1000 users goto that
[04:02] <dcherniv> savagecroc, why do you want that?
[04:02] <savagecroc> that way we don't have to do anything awkward like manage clustered databases
[04:03] <dcherniv> savagecroc, you will have to do clustered databases anyway
[04:03] <ubuntu-tester> sk1special: save MBR and restore afterwards?
[04:03] <dr_willis> Guest34539:  divx is  the mpeg4 codec with some extensions.
[04:03] <dcherniv> savagecroc, otherwise how you gonna keep the databases consistent across the servers?
[04:03] <savagecroc> two reasons, location.. our users are in totally different locations (i.e. china / australia), second easy scalability
[04:03] <Guest34539> yeah
[04:03] <savagecroc> dcherniv: by using scripts to replicate the data across multiple servers
[04:03] <dr_willis> so most any player that can play mpeg4 can play divx
[04:03] <dcherniv> savagecroc, not a good idea
[04:04] <bazhang> Guest34539, so audacious and mplayer. No need for Wine
[04:04] <savagecroc> dcherniv: also that means you can replicate between differnt versions of the software.. i.e. imagine you have node A running version 56   and node B running version 57.. you can copy all the users to node B and change the datastructure of their data.. and then they can connect to either
[04:04] <sk1special> ubuntu-tester, there is a way to do it without doing that..i have half of it saved in a word file..but i can not find the original link
[04:04] <Guest34539> so i should get from Ubuntu Software Center?
[04:04] <bazhang> yes
[04:04] <dr_willis> veehd seems to be using shockwave-flash as the plugin to watch movies
[04:05] <dcherniv> savagecroc, how will you know which databases has the most relevant information
[04:05] <savagecroc> dcherniv: i can't see the database cluster working... i think it would be better to have separate database machines
[04:05] <ubuntu-tester> Guest34539 iv you want to encode video use Avidemux
[04:05] <dcherniv> savagecroc, when in geographically different areas i dont see how the loadbalancer will work either?
[04:05] <dr_willis> and the freefulmovies.net is just a spammy search site taht links to other sites..
[04:06] <Toph2> anything in linux that can display the Folio Views format?
[04:06] <ubuntu-tester> MBR in a Word file? o_O
[04:06] <savagecroc> dcherniv: for example lets say you are user 1234.. we are currently storing your info on server-25(ver 55) server-26 (ver 55) and server-28(ver 56)
[04:06] <savagecroc> we let you connect to any of those machines
[04:06] <dcherniv> savagecroc, ok
[04:06] <savagecroc> if the data is 3 mins out of date.. the app will have to cope
[04:06] <savagecroc> 99.9% of the time.. you should always connect to the same machine though
[04:07] <sk1special> ubuntu-tester, no i have half the instructions on how to do it saved in a word file ( how to do it without having to get rid if the mbr ) but i dont have the other half and cant find the original link online i got them from
[04:07] <Guest34539> OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH I WILL TRIES DOES PROGRAM AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL
[04:07] <dcherniv> savagecroc, there's no way to ensure that, users wont do that 99.9% of time
[04:07] <bazhang> no caps Guest34539
[04:07] <Guest34539> sorry
[04:07] <savagecroc> dcherniv: load balancer should help.. lets say you are 1234 and you are in china.. we can go.. right you are allocated to our mainland china server
[04:07] <ubuntu-tester> savagecroc, dcherniv: it's a bit offtopic here
[04:07] <SunMoonStar1> Have to ask here because the Lubuntu chan is looking dead. I'm on Lubuntu and the lxpanel system tray icons are not right adjusting anymore. Using spacer applet and checking 'stretch' just totally hides any applet after it (they dissapear).
[04:07] <rcmaehl> I need confirmation that 2908 petabytes per second is not possible with current technology and my apt-get just went glitchy http://imgur.com/MyNdk
[04:07] <savagecroc> dcherniv: they don't see this.. it should all look like a single address to them
[04:08] <dcherniv> savagecroc, what will happen is a user will make his changes on server-25, 26 and 28 at the same time and then when software will attempt to cope they will complain that their changes are gone
[04:08] <rcmaehl> Petabytes per second isn't possible right? RIGHT!?
[04:08] <dr_willis> rcmaehl:  ask in #hardware
[04:08] <bazhang> savagecroc, dcherniv please take this to the appropriate channel, like ##networking or the like
[04:08] <dcherniv> savagecroc, not possible if one of the servers runs different version software
[04:08] <rcmaehl> I mean from a ubuntu repo
[04:08] <dcherniv> my bad
[04:08] <rcmaehl> dr_willis: I mean from a ubuntu repo
[04:08] <dcherniv> out to work
[04:09] <rcmaehl> dr_willis: apt-get reported 2908 PB/s
[04:09] <sk1special> http://pastebin.com/7af3s8uc
[04:09] <ubuntu-tester> rcmaehl: confirmed
[04:09] <dr_willis> rcmaehl:  sounds like a network glitch
[04:09] <rcmaehl> okay good
[04:09] <dr_willis> or your screen is dirty
[04:09] <sk1special> a couple of the steps..minus some graphics. but i cant find any guide similar again.
[04:09] <rcmaehl> dr_willis: http://imgur.com/MyNdk
[04:09] <dr_willis> and you miss read B/s
[04:09] <savagecroc> bazhang: nah networking is all about how am i setting up my border routers, and what protocol should i use for this.. there really isin't a cluster help channel
[04:09] <dr_willis> rcmaehl:  does it really matter...
[04:10] <rcmaehl> Well I'm surprised apt-get can measure in PB/s
[04:10] <bazhang> savagecroc, well here is not really topical for that
[04:10] <rcmaehl> I mean why >.>
[04:10] <nbs> Anyone willing to help someone with installation problems alongside Win8? :(
[04:10] <savagecroc> bazhang: i'm building the whole lot with ubuntu :)
[04:10] <SunMoonStar1> I've been trying to figure out this xpanel issue for 3 hours I should probably stop caring that the icons are not right adjusting
[04:10] <bazhang> nbs ask the channel
=== aarcane_ is now known as aarcane
[04:11] <dr_willis> SunMoonStar1:  or totally reset the panel and see if that helps
[04:11] <bazhang> SunMoonStar1, why not reset them
[04:12] <SunMoonStar1> reset? not sure what you mean. I did try to reinstall xpanel and to kill it and reload it and those didn't help
[04:12] <nbs> Well I followed a guide on a forum thread about installing it.  And I actually used Xubuntu, but that shouldn't really make a difference in installation, would it? :S
[04:12] <SunMoonStar1> I also tried restart
[04:12] <SunMoonStar1> and I tried to replace the config file with the default config file
[04:12] <nbs> Anyways it seemed to install just fine, but only Windows 8 boots.  There's no option for Ubuntu
[04:12] <nbs> no grub appears or anything
[04:12] <dr_willis> SunMoonStar1:  tip #1 - removeing packages via apt/package manager tools do NOT touch setting files in the users home directory
[04:13] <dr_willis> SunMoonStar1:  you can find whatever config files are being in your home, and delete/rename them to reset lxde back to defaults
[04:13] <c2tarun> nbs, how did you install?
[04:13] <nbs> DVD
[04:13] <nbs> I disabled secure boot
[04:13] <c2tarun> nbs, no, you said you followed some guide, which one.
[04:13] <SunMoonStar1> dr_willis: I'll try to rename stuff
[04:13] <nbs> http://askubuntu.com/questions/221835/installing-ubuntu-on-a-pre-installed-uefi-supported-windows-8-system
[04:13] <nbs> The first reply
[04:13] <ogist> someone here told me to get xubuntu and it's slow still
[04:14] <SunMoonStar1> ogist: if it's slow try lubuntu it's for older comps
[04:14] <ogist> lubuntu software center doesnt even haven stars
[04:14] <ubuntu-tester> rcmaehl: it's because file size was too small and downloaded very fast so apt didn't have enough time to correctly estimate speed
[04:14] <dr_willis> ogist:  lubuntu would be the lightest desktop with the feature set most people need
[04:14] <ogist> how do i make xubuntu faster
[04:15] <dr_willis> ogist:  i doubt if theres much you can do to it
[04:15] <ogist> i dont think the creators of linux and ubuntu understand much about what a shortcut on a desktop is
[04:15] <nbs> Also what's strange is that it didn't ask me anything about partitioning during installation.  I previously created space for it, and I guess it just assumed that was for it?
[04:15] <ogist> what was so hard for them to make a shortcut to a program easy
[04:16] <dr_willis> ogist:  or you are thinking in terms of windows .lnk files instead of linux filesystem links. and .desktop launchers
[04:16] <ogist> yeah
[04:16] <ogist> it's not as easy
[04:16] <ogist> i should be able to create a shortcut
[04:16] <dr_willis> with lxde i thought you just drag.dropped from the menu to the desktop
[04:16] <dr_willis> the ides of items on the desktop is slowly getting phased out
[04:17] <ogist> im using ubuntu on a 3.4 ghz computer that has quad-cores
[04:17] <ogist> i have 8 gigabytes of ram
[04:17] <ubuntu-tester> ogist: right-click and select Make Link is not easy?
[04:17] <ogist> oh
[04:17] <bazhang> !enter | ogist
[04:17] <ubottu> ogist: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[04:17] <ogist> yeah ubuntu-tester
[04:17] <dr_willis> ogist:  if xubuntu is slow on that.. you need to check your video card drivers
[04:17] <ogist> but it didnt work
[04:17] <ogist> i double clicked this new shortcut and it just opened and closed
[04:18] <bazhang> ogist, please...with the enter key
[04:18] <ogist> dr_willis: yeah and mess up my computer
[04:18] <dr_willis> ogist:  whatever then,. good luck
=== Rar9_ is now known as Rar9
[04:18] <ogist> video drivers for what
[04:18] <ogist> a non vide-driver related problem
[04:19] <ubuntu-tester> ogist: *that* is the problem, sate it and don't troll here :)
[04:19] <dr_willis> your video card. If you have a quad core  3+ghz system.. it shold be able to handle any desktop out there.  unless theres issues with the video card
[04:19] <ogist> im not having problems on my quad-core
[04:19] <dr_willis> if xubuntu is slow.. you seem to be
[04:19] <ogist> i have a dell inspiron
[04:19] <ogist> i have more than one computer
[04:19] <bazhang> ogist, you are having problems with over use of the enter key.
[04:20] <ogist> bazhang: it's ok
[04:20] <bazhang> ogist, stop it
[04:20] <ubuntu-tester> ogist: by the way .lnk files on Win can break as well and can even make secyrity holes
[04:21] <ogist> ubuntu-tester: i have one file i want to open from my desktop
[04:22] <machicola> how do I, via command line, put a script after a particular process at bootup
[04:22] <SunMoonStar1> so I removed ~/.config/lxpanel/Lubuntu/config and ~/.config/lxpanel/Lubuntu/panels/panel and restarted and the problem remains
[04:22] <clfs> .bashrc
[04:23] <machicola> clfs, in response to me?
[04:23] <ubuntu-tester> ogist: ok have you made it as i said?
[04:23] <clfs> yes.:)
[04:23] <clfs> : )
[04:23] <dr_willis> machicola:  what 'process'   the upsttart system is designed to run in parallel as much as possible.  it uses  a trigger system that can trigger a second event/service after a speficic one loads
[04:23] <ogist> ubuntu-tester: yeah and it just opens and closes within about 500 ms
[04:23] <c2tarun> ogist, :P why do you want to make Xubuntu even faster? Isn't it fast enough?
[04:24] <ogist> c2tarun: are you serious or are you a troll?
[04:24] <ubuntu-tester> open it's properties, what's in 'Location:'?
[04:24] <c2tarun> ogist, I am too small for a troll :) lets stick with I am serious
[04:24] <IdleOne> Pay attention people, ogist is having a problem with a shortcut, he said nothing about making xfce faster.
[04:24] <machicola> the process would be after gnome desktop and another program , xbindkeys, have already started... so not once the desktop GUI has appeared but a bit later
[04:24] <ubuntu-tester> open what's in 'Link target:'?
[04:24] <ogist> keep in mind i have two computers
[04:25] <machicola> clfs, that doesn't seem to give any control though as to precisely when the script will run does it?
[04:25] <SunMoonStar1> dr_willis: dono if you saw that ^. I removed the config and panel files and restarted but it didn't help
[04:25] <c2tarun> IdleOne, actually he said, but never mind
[04:25] <ogist> well
[04:25] <dr_willis> machicola:  use the .config/autostart direcory. make a script.. have it sleep for about 30 seconds so gnome gets loaded then runs your commands
[04:25] <machicola> doesn't the .bashrc just execute at a specific time?
[04:25] <ogist> neither problem was addressed
[04:25] <ogist> so it doesnt really matter
[04:25] <dr_willis> machicola:  .bashrc would not be where to do this at
[04:26] <machicola> haha, dr_willis it's funny you mentioned that... because I did exactly that but with .xsession
[04:26] <machicola> which i believe, for practical purposes, would be akin to .config/autostart
[04:26] <machicola> but it's not working out for some reason
[04:26] <ubuntu-tester> ogist: neitrer problem was clearly stated, in the first place
[04:26] <dr_willis> using .xsession would take total control of your X session.. you need to be sure to load everything you need
[04:26] <dr_willis> machicola:  the autostart directory is used by several differnt desktops so is more universial
[04:26] <ogist> ubuntu-tester, you lack reading comprehension
[04:26] <machicola> ooops, sorry dr_willis, .xsessionrc
[04:27] <praxis> hello
[04:27] <dr_willis> machicola:  cant say ive ever seen a  .xsessionrc
[04:27] <machicola> first i tried xsession, realized what you just said, then did .xsessionrc
[04:27] <bazhang> ogist, thats enough.
[04:27] <ubuntu-tester> ogist: forget, what's in link properties
[04:27] <machicola> it does work through .xsessionrc, ok... maybe i'll try .config/autostart, thanks
[04:27] <ogist> the file is in link properties

[04:28] <praxis> anyone know where i can get the torchwood interface
[04:28] <ogist> alright then
[04:28] <ogist> no need to get mad
[04:28] <dr_willis> praxis:  you mean 'theme' or what exactly?
[04:28] <ubuntu-tester> ogist: check link target points to your file exactly
[04:28] <praxis> yes theme
[04:28] <ogist> it does ubuntu-tester
[04:29] <ogist> it just opens and closes
[04:29] <dr_willis> praxis:  theres numerous gnome theme sites out there to search through
[04:29] <bazhang> praxis, at one of the ubuntu theme sites, like gnome-look
[04:29] <ubuntu-tester> ogist: what type of file
[04:30] <praxis> i can look there thank you
[04:30] <BullShark> where do i find instructions for installing steam on ubuntu?
[04:31] <ubuntu-tester> BullShark: on Steam website
[04:31] <clfs> en..
[04:31] <clfs> maybe you can try apt-cache search steam
[04:31] <clfs> bullshark.
[04:32] <bazhang> !steam
[04:32] <ubottu> Valve have officially announced that they are developing Steam and are working with !ubuntu during their devlopment, see http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/ for further details, you can also join #ubuntu-steam for discussion.

[04:36] <SunMoonStar1> what's the word for it how in ubuntu unity and mac os the applications share a menu bar?
[04:37] <Ben64> in ubuntu i think its the "global menu"
[04:37] <SunMoonStar1> Ben64: do you know if it's possible to have that with lxde
[04:38] <Ben64> i don't know
[04:38] <SunMoonStar1> okay
[04:38] <IdleOne> SunMoonStar1: might try asking in #lubuntu
[04:40] <hectron> Hey all. I have a question. I have installed Eclipse in my desktop. I followed instructions in a tutorial. However, I see my Eclipse in my applications but I can only run it if I open a terminal and type in "eclipse"
[04:40] <hectron> Any thoughts on this?
[04:41] <bazhang> what tutorial hectron
[04:42] <hectron> I'm trying to find that tutorial. One sec, bazhang.
[04:42] <machicola> dr_willis, the same thing that happened to me earlier happened again... creating a symbolic link in ~/.config/autostart isn't starting the script up for some reason
[04:42] <hectron> I think it's something like this: https://javarunner.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/integrate-eclipse-juno-in-linux-ubuntu-12-10-with-command-line/
[04:42] <bazhang> hectron, did you install eclipse from outside the package management system?
[04:42] <machicola> because I did actually try it with ~/.config/autostart
[04:43] <fego> hectron: if you have downloaded the eclipse from the website, the zip contains a execuble called "eclipse"
[04:43] <machicola> am trying to read up to figure out what this could be
[04:43] <fego> you can double clik it open
[04:44] <clfs> I always double click eclipse to open it.
[04:46] <dr_willis> machicola:    its got a #!/bin/bash at the start? it is ececutable? try copying the script itsekf to the directory not a link
[04:48] <sk1special> is the guy still here who was trying to install on win 8>
[04:48] <sk1special> ?*
[04:48] <machicola> yeah #!/usr/bin/env bash , and I've tried with the executable
[04:48] <hectron> bazhang: I installed Eclipse from the .tar.gz. What was confusing I think was the desktop entry for Unity. I was not too familiar with it. I noticed something wrong with it, so I will restart my PC.
[04:49] <dr_willis> you got & at the end of the proper commands so it dosent hang the script? ;)
[04:49] <dr_willis> that about covers the common problems
[04:49] <machicola> the script is just this.... gnome-terminal &;firefox &;xchat &
[04:49] <cmj141> hactron : i just finished installing eclipse juno with ADT SDK
[04:50] <machicola> the script has been working in all the other config files... this one is unique in that sense
[04:50] <machicola> this one meaning, .config/autostart
[04:50] <machicola> method
[04:50] <dr_willis> machicola:  you could copy the .desktop files for those 3 apps into that autostart directory also
[04:50] <cmj141> hectron : you are trying to get a shortcut on your launcher is that it?
[04:50] <hectron> Yes.
[04:50] <machicola> where would the .desktop files be located?
[04:50] <cmj141> ive been searching for days on how to do it
[04:50] <dr_willis> use the locate command to find them
[04:51] <machicola> i'm not familiar with .desktop
[04:51] <cmj141> still nothing
[04:51] <dr_willis> locate xchat.desktop
[04:51] <machicola> so just firefox.desktop? etc. ok
[04:51] <dr_willis> should show where
[04:51] <cmj141> the only way to do it, is through a package manager
[04:51] <machicola> ok, thanks
[04:51] <hectron> I'm using Cinnamon.
[04:51] <hectron> And would like to have Eclipse launchable from the start-menu.
[04:51] <cmj141> if you want a clickable link then use synaptic or ubuntus package manager and download eclipse
[04:52] <cmj141> so remove your eclipse. and then reinstall it with your package manager
[04:52] <dr_willis> or make a custome .desktop file for your eclipse
[04:52] <bazhang> hectron, so go to cinnamon/mint support for taht
[04:52] <hectron> I see.
[04:53] <hectron> dr_willis: You're right. I had to customized the *.desktop file for Eclipse.
[04:53] <hectron> I had improper syntax.
[04:53] <hectron> I had mispelled Application (spelled it as Applicatoni)
[04:53] <hectron> dr_willis++
[04:59] <apm1> "apt-get purge removes all the scripts or adjustments auto-generated by the packages when they were being installed ?
[05:00] <apm1> i tried installing fprint for my thinkpad's fingerprint reader
[05:00] <apm1> but there was no fprintd package  so i just installed fprintpam and a fprint lib. package
[05:01] <apm1> but seeeing that they are useless without fprintd
[05:01] <dr_willis> where did those pacakges come from?
[05:01] <apm1> the ubuntu repo

[05:02] <apm1> i tried that
[05:02] <apm1> no fprintd shows up on my searches

[05:03] <apm1> let me run another search them

[05:08] <clfs> my ubuntu is 10.04...
[05:09] <apm1> so they decided to drop it only for 12.04 ?
[05:09] <dr_willis> no  idea

[05:11] <dr_willis> yep
[05:11] <dr_willis> i hate the cutesy names
[05:11] <apm1> i can not afford to run anything but a LTS
[05:12] <dr_willis> lts or non lts matters very little to me
[05:13] <dr_willis> for a home/perspnal use - i cant imagine why it matters much
[05:13] <apm1> well it matters when you hate having to reinstall or tweak for bugs
[05:14] <topper4125> my only reason for running LTS only is it cuts down on the amount of time I have to babysit the OS...
[05:14] <dr_willis> i reinstall every 6 mo anyway to keep up with the latest so i can do better support in here
[05:14] <dr_willis> im not sure why lts really matters in that respect topper4125
[05:15] <dr_willis> i dont run any services however. :) and only got 4 users.
[05:15] <dr_willis> small time home lan/user
[05:16] <BWMerlin> Nvidia has updated their official driver release, how long does it take for that then to appear in the ubuntu repositories?
[05:17] <genius> hello world
[05:17] <topper4125> dr_willis, only matters for my own laziness :) I used to run Arch for quite a while after I started getting serious with Linux... wanted to know more about how it all worked... but after spending too much time on bleeding edge, I'm looking for a more "set it and forget it" OS
[05:17] <machicola> dr_willis, the sleep thing doesn't work because it just pauses the whole init process altogether
[05:18] <machicola> but i'll probably just go with this
[05:18] <machicola> let it all start up at the same time, after spending a day on it lol
[05:18] <machicola> i'm sure there are apps and extras and stuff but just thought I'd like to do it within what is included
[05:19] <epitamizor> is there version of ubuntu with enlightenment?
[05:19] <machicola> because it seemed relatively simple anyways
[05:19] <dr_willis> epitamizor: e has ppa repos epitamizor. I belive

[05:20] <machicola> thanks for help
[05:20] <topper4125> install e17, log out, switch to enlightenment desktop, then enjoy some cake
[05:20] <dr_willis> isent e 18 out. :-D
[05:20] <topper4125> !e18
[05:21] <dr_willis> the cake is a lie
[05:21] <topper4125> I know e17 just got out of beta... beyond that.. not sure
[05:21] <topper4125> !info e18
[05:21] <ubottu> Package e18 does not exist in quantal
[05:24] <dr_willis> every time i try  e. i find it lacking..
[05:24] <topper4125> me too... which is odd because I'm an avid XFCE user
[05:25] <gnomefreak> is there a way to diable the "paste" command in bash?
[05:25] <gnomefreak> s/diable/disable
[05:26] <epitamizor> upgrading from openbox to E, maybe xfce later
[05:26] <dniMretsaM> gnomefreak: what exactly would you want to do that for?
[05:26] <gnomefreak> epitamizor: E17?
[05:26] <dr_willis> never noticed a paste command
[05:27] <gnomefreak> dniMretsaM: im writing also of alias' and this one is in my way
[05:27] <gnomefreak> dr_willis: i didnt until like 2 days ago
[05:27] <dr_willis> aliass have higher priority
[05:27] <dr_willis> alias paste=echo foo
[05:28] <dr_willis> paste        should say foo
[05:28] <dr_willis> if i recall that chapter right
[05:28] <gnomefreak> dr_willis: gnomefreak@Development:~$ alias paste=echo foo
[05:28] <gnomefreak> bash: alias: foo: not found
[05:29] <dniMretsaM> echo foo should be in parentheses
[05:29] <dniMretsaM> er, quotation marks
[05:29] <dniMretsaM> geez I'm tired
[05:30] <gnomefreak> dniMretsaM: does nothing here no echo
[05:30] <dr_willis> im on my phone no idea where quotes are
[05:31] <dr_willis> the default ls alias is similer
[05:31] <dniMretsaM> gnomefreak: you mean that the echo command isn't found?
[05:32] <clfs> alias testecho="echo foo"
[05:32] <gnomefreak> dniMretsaM: no here is the output
[05:32] <clfs> this can work
[05:32] <topper4125> brb... this ICR app is less than appealing...
[05:32] <gnomefreak> gnomefreak@Development:~$ alias "paste=echo foo"
[05:32] <gnomefreak> gnomefreak@Development:~$
[05:32] <clfs> no gnomefreak
[05:32] <dniMretsaM> I just tested running this: alias paste="echo foo"
[05:32] <dniMretsaM> it worked just fine
[05:33] <topper4125> ahh mildly better
[05:33] <rushy> can someone tell me that why after i just installed 12.10 server that after the bios the screen just turns black and nothing happens
[05:33] <gnomefreak> oh at echo my fault
[05:34] <gnomefreak> still doesnt output anything
[05:34] <topper4125> rushy, what are you expecting it to do?
[05:34] <rushy> to show me a command line or something
[05:34] <rushy> i've never dealt with the server side
[05:35] <dr_willis> try the nomodeset option perhaps
[05:35] <gnomefreak> sounds like a reinstall, but it is 12:35 so im not thinking at full brain
[05:35] <dr_willis> could be the servers framebuffer or somthing is goofing you up
[05:35] <topper4125> oh... okay... so.. NOTHING at all. had someone here the other day and they were wondering where the GUI was on server...
[05:35] <gnomefreak> 12:35am
[05:36] <dr_willis> when in doubt.. try nomodeset first. ;)
[05:36] <rushy> topper4125, nope just black screen
[05:36] <dr_willis> and then the rescue/recovery mode..  and be sure to install ssh to make it easier to twiddle with
[05:36] <gnomefreak> there is no gui on server instal
[05:36] <topper4125> I would go with Grub glitch, or hardware fail.
[05:36] <rushy> could it be raid problem?
[05:37] <dr_willis> I dont know anything about raids.. so no idea on thst
[05:37] <dniMretsaM> rushy: well if the filesystem is messed up then it could be.
[05:37] <topper4125> gnomefreak, yup... we (me and 3 other people) spent about 10 mins trying to explain that to the person who was asking lol...
[05:37] <dniMretsaM> I'd start with dr_willis' suggestion, though
[05:37] <gnomefreak> lol
[05:37] <gnomefreak> im with dniMretsaM on that one
[05:37] <dr_willis> if you can see the grub menu at boot time. test out nomodeset, and the text option.
[05:37] <dniMretsaM> topper4125: that sounds fantastic...
[05:37] <rushy> i'm doing RAID5 but my install before got messed up at the bootloader install part, re-burned a new disk and "fixed" the install of it but thats it
[05:38] <dr_willis> change 'quiet splash' to be like 'noquiet nosplash nomodeset nofb verbose text'      i cant think of any others to toss in....
[05:38] <rushy> dr_willis: i don't see grub menu anywhere
[05:38] <dniMretsaM> hold Shift while booting if GRUB doesn't come up
[05:38] <topper4125> did you md5 the iso?
[05:38] <dr_willis> rushy:  press and hold shift perhaps it may show up . as it boots..
[05:38] <dr_willis> OR grub is totally borked.. and thats the reason why
[05:39] <dr_willis> i never use a server install so not sure how it sets up grub
[05:39] <rushy> ok shift made grub show up
[05:39] <dniMretsaM> dr_willis: the server installer is just di (which Ubiquity sits on top of), so it doesn't really do anything different than the desktop
[05:40] <rushy> 2 options now ubuntu and advanced options for ubuntu
[05:40] <topper4125> tbh, I don't either, this machine is a 12.04 Mini install w/ xfce
[05:40] <dr_willis> dniMretsaM:  but does it hide the gryb menu by default..
[05:40] <dr_willis> rushy:  so grub works. ;)
[05:41] <gnomefreak> dr_willis: they tried that but removed it so you can see it
[05:41] <dniMretsaM> misunderstood the question, but yes. if you had a server running with the GRUB screen coming up, the machine wouldn't boot
[05:41] <dniMretsaM> so it hides it by default
[05:41] <rushy> dr_willis: yes it does when i hold shift down, just wondering if i have a problem with it doing it all the time
[05:41] <dniMretsaM> rushy: boot the recovery option. it boots with NOMODESET
[05:41] <dr_willis> rushy:   so hit 'e' to edit the ubuntu line and try the nomodeset option.   if it works.. id set grub to not auto hide
[05:42] <dr_willis> recovery is handy also. ;)
[05:42] <gnomefreak> i dont recall how to do it but you can disable hiding grub so you can see it
[05:42] <dr_willis> its in /etc/default/grubb
[05:42] <dr_willis> its in /etc/default/grub
[05:42] <dr_willis> i find the whole auto-hideing  sort of a silly bending over backwards for the 'idiot-proofing' masses
[05:42]  * gnomefreak smoke and think :(
[05:43] <dniMretsaM> change GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT. that'll make the machine boot slower, though. annoying, imo
[05:43] <dr_willis> when a server has 10 month uptime.. a addational 3 sec to boot is trivial
[05:43] <rushy> hold up trying it right now if i can get back to it
[05:43] <dniMretsaM> dr_willis: true. I guess it depends on how long you set it to wait
[05:44] <dr_willis> my android phone takes longer to boot then my Ubuntu Desktop box. ;)
[05:44] <topper4125> !grub | one of these will talk about autohide, and delays
[05:44] <ubottu> one of these will talk about autohide, and delays: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[05:44] <dr_willis> but i do have a SSD on the ubuntu box
[05:44]  * dniMretsaM is jealous of dr_willis
[05:44] <Theodore> hello
[05:45] <Theodore> i have a simple question
[05:45] <dniMretsaM> btw, dr_willis. do you hang out on #raspberrypi?
[05:45] <dniMretsaM> hi Theodore
[05:45] <Theodore> what is the best theme manager for the latest kde?
[05:45] <dr_willis> dniMretsaM:  im on my Pi right now. ;)
[05:45] <Theodore> hi dniMretsaM
[05:45] <dr_willis> dniMretsaM:  it boots faster then my Cellphone also.
[05:45] <topper4125> !best
[05:45] <ubottu> Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[05:45] <dr_willis> is there even more then one theme manager for KDE?
[05:45] <dniMretsaM> Theodore: the stuff in System Settings is your best bet
[05:46] <Theodore> well I'm installing
[05:46] <Theodore> awn
[05:46] <Theodore> right now
[05:46] <dr_willis> awn is not a theme manager
[05:46] <dr_willis> it has its own themes.. however
[05:46] <Theodore> ok
[05:46] <Theodore> how come when i use system settings
[05:46] <Theodore> it does not show the styles downloaded
[05:47] <dniMretsaM> Theodore: have you installed them?
[05:47] <Theodore> yes
[05:47] <dr_willis> i dont use kde. so really cant help
[05:47] <dniMretsaM> dr_willis: I thought that I had seen you on there
[05:47] <dr_willis> dniMretsaM:  yep. I  hang there and here. ;)
[05:48] <dniMretsaM> Theodore: 1) are you looking in the right section (the theming is kind of split up) and 2) how did you install them?

[06:30] <replica> :| ?
[06:30] <replica> i am a total noob
[06:30] <nearst> singharkirat, enter "e" on grub line option before boot
[06:31] <miroesq> nearst, it is for a very specific program, netborder express for my sangoma telephony card. from searching and reading, it may very well be because the program was installed under one kernel and now a different kernel is running.
[06:31] <singharkirat> Okay.. :)

=== lickalott_ is now known as lickalott
[06:31] <nearst> miroesq, yeah. some application,distro, mods really have specific option in kernel. im guess try boot with your last kernel
[06:32] <replica> so wat shd i do ?
[06:32] <miroesq> nearst, if i reboot with my last kernel, can i change that again without any problems?
[06:33] <decci> I have installed Ubuntu without RAID partitioning system. I have just one /dev/sda1,2,3 partiton I can see through fdisk. I added 3 more disk. How shall I create RAID out of my four disk
[06:33] <nearst> miroesq, if application have no problem with your last kernel. just always boot the right kernel. incase u dont wanna play with kernel compile thinggy
[06:33] <dr_willis> anomoly:  you can do a full install to a flash drive. if its large enough
[06:33] <decci> Is it possible to include /dev/sda too for RAID
[06:33] <topper4125> Unity desktop really doesn't offer much in the way of user control of the appearance... best idea for those who want total control of their desktop enviroment is to switch to one that isnt so controlling.
[06:33] <backbox> Bad news, idk anything about it, I always use xfce on whatever distro I run, but the good news is it very popular, very well known, and well documented I'm sure... google could probably help you with some persistence... replica your name just to alert you if your IRCclient supports it.

[06:35] <backbox> hakuna
[06:35]  * backbox is leaving now... bye bye all
[06:36] <miroesq> nearst, your instructions are to uncomment #GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true" at /etc/default/grub, sudo update-grub and boot in recovery mode or last kernel. I can uncomment that line, execute the update grub command,, but i have no idea how ot reboot in recovery mode or using last kernel.
[06:36] <anomoly> dr_willis: it's been a while since I tired, but I think last time I did the usb install it messed with local bootloader and I had to have the flash drive in to boot the local OS
[06:37] <nearst> miroesq, try reboot and choose last kernel or recovery mode
[06:37] <miroesq> nearst, another problem is that i am in a remote location using ssh
[06:38] <miroesq> nearst, so i can't choose anything at the boot screen
[06:39] <miroesq> nearst, can i issue a command to boot using a specific kernel?
[06:39] <dr_willis> anomoly:  you tell grub to install to the mbr of the usb
[06:39] <dr_willis> anomoly:  i do usb installs all the time
[06:40] <nearst> miroesq, ouch. try ls -l /boot. check how many kernel inside
[06:40] <anomoly> dr_willis: excellent, I'll give it a go. Thanks for the help!

[07:12] <Rosuav> Hi, I've no idea if I'm in the right place or not... is there a proper place to ask for help building Upstart?
[07:12] <nearst> ubuntu from wubi and set harddisk to 30gb for installation? that what u mean?
[07:12] <nixbag> so i'm using a custom ubuntu install from the mini.iso, and I don't have networking-manager. tried editing /etc/network/interfaces (works in debian).
[07:13] <dr_willis> after the install, you can enlarge your wubi hd/save file i belive
[07:13] <miroesq> nearst, so no matter what, the system will reboot again, it is not going to get stuck?
[07:13] <mighty2361> no
[07:13] <mighty2361> more than 30gb
[07:13] <nearst> miroesq, ya. only different kernel.current kernel is problem to your application. maybe try boot another
[07:14] <nixbag> is there a special way to set a static IP from the commandline? doing it via /etc/network/interfaces like most other distros doesn't work.
[07:14] <dr_willis> mighty2361:  id say check askubuntu.com to see if they have a anwser for that.
[07:14] <nixbag> and i don't have networkmanager installed. did a minimal install.
[07:14] <Rosuav> nixbag, I disable or uninstall networkmanager on all my boxes, and then /etc/network/interfaces works fine
[07:15] <dr_willis> nixbag:  theres the ifconfig and other commands
[07:15] <nixbag> Rosuav: weird. I always get connection problems after setting it to static
[07:15] <nearst> nixbag, append /etc/network/interfaces line to static
[07:15] <Rosuav> auto eth1
[07:15] <Rosuav> iface eth1 inet static
[07:15] <Rosuav> That's not working?
[07:16] <zykotic10> Rosuav: you'd also need the lines: address, netmask, network, broadcast and gateway.
[07:16] <nixbag> my setup now is as follows:  iface eth0 inet static\n address 192.168.1.x\n netmask 255.255.255.0\n gateway 192.168.1.1
[07:16] <nixbag> in debian all i need is address, netmask, and gateway
[07:16] <nearst> your /etc/resolv.conf ?
[07:17] <Rosuav> Assuming of course that that isn't a literal 'x', that should work. What isn't working?
=== bentwo is now known as bentinata
[07:17] <nixbag> my resolv.conf has my nameservers
[07:17] <bentinata> anyone understand NetBeansIDE?
[07:17] <bentinata> anyone understand NetBeansIDE?
[07:17] <nixbag> i was using x just as a variable
[07:17] <Rosuav> Yep
[07:17] <alang> I've gotten a bus error, and my core file limit is set to unlimited, but nothing was created in /var/crash. Why could this be? (my /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is the default ubuntu one)
[07:17] <Rosuav> I've seen some weird config file errors though :)
[07:18] <nixbag> but shouldnt the network pull my nameservers from my resolv.conf anyway? i shouldnt have to put them in the /etc/network/interfaces
[07:18] <nearst> route add gw default <ip>
[07:18] <nearst> check your gateway by route -n
[07:19] <nixbag> gateway is correct. the settings always worked in debian 100%, but doesnt in ubuntu
[07:19] <nixbag> tried flushing dns also
[07:20] <nearst> usually work with me on minimal installation
[07:20] <nixbag> maybe its my router giving me problems
[07:21] <Rosuav> I actually don't have a recent Ubuntu system to test on
[07:21] <Rosuav> My latest is... Maverick. :|
[07:21] <nearst> i love karmic most
[07:21] <Rosuav> My server's still running Karmic.
[07:21] <Rosuav> Until I had a UPS failure last week, it was boasting 129 weeks of uptime
[07:21] <miroesq> nearst, sure my system is not going to get stuck if i set default to 2 and reboot?
[07:22] <meet> can some one give me a step by step help with installation?
[07:22] <miroesq> nearst, i looked at grub.cfg and i believe that 2 is right. then again, i have never done any of this before. i am using serach, reading a lot and of course, your help :)
[07:22] <nearst> miroesq, set default=2 and update-grub
=== dankest|away is now known as dankest
[07:23] <meet> i have 20gb partition. want to install ubuntu to dual boot alongwith win7. on the installtion screen i selected something else.. which is showing me the gparted tool i think. how should i select my 20gb drive and all the swap and all?
[07:23] <nearst> miroesq, latest install kernel always default=0 , incase u wanna set other kernel. default=0 options will do the work
[07:24] <miroesq> nearst, here goes nothing :)
[07:24] <shothex1> #icmp
[07:25] <summeyte> So irritating
[07:25] <bennett1> hi! Can anyone tell me if there is a command to check what DNS servers I'm using?
[07:25] <Shirakawasuna> I want my OS to be on a RAID 1 array. I'm open to a fresh installation option. However I"m not finding any guides that specifically apply to anything since 10.04. Does anyone know how to set up RAID1 for / ?
[07:26] <dr_willis> meet:  you will need to make 2 partios. one of type ext4 to mount to '/' and one of type swap  with the fs type of swap
[07:26] <meet> dr_willis so my ntfs drive is visible. should i click on change?
[07:26] <shothex1> bennett1,  cat /etc/resolv.conf
[07:27] <dr_willis> meet:  you have a empty ntfs partion you are wanting to delete to use it?
[07:27] <meet> yes
[07:27] <dr_willis> meet:  so delete it. and make 2 partions in its placxe. one for / one for swap
[07:27] <meet> how much should i keep the swap?
[07:28] <nearst> usually double size of your ram
[07:28] <dr_willis> depends on your ram and needs
[07:28] <dr_willis> any rule of thumb can be argued  either way ;)
[07:28] <bennett1> shothex1: tks
[07:28] <yuqiang> nice to meet you.
[07:28] <nearst> yup
[07:28] <meet> is 2 gb enough? dr_willis
[07:28] <dr_willis> double ram would be silly on a 32gb ram machine
[07:28] <dr_willis> i dont even have a swap on my 8gb box. ;)
[07:29] <summeyte> Does anyone know how to edit grub so I can add the option to boot from sdb1?
[07:29] <dr_willis> but thats because i frogot to make one
[07:29] <dr_willis> summeyte:  you can put custom entries in /etc/grub.d/40_custom if you knew what to put in there
[07:29] <meet> dr_willis i tend to hibernate instead of shut down. so i was told on another channel to keep a swap
[07:29] <dr_willis> i never hibernate
[07:29] <nearst> dr_willis, agree.mine on 16gb ram
[07:29] <meet> so out of 20 gb.. will 18+2 be good enough?
[07:30] <moses_> good morning to each one of you
[07:30] <dr_willis> meet:  whats your ram size?
[07:30] <meet> 6gb
[07:30] <nearst> meet, 1gb is ok
[07:30] <dr_willis> if you want to use hibernate - then you will want 6gb+a little more.
[07:30] <dr_willis> ir you dont - 1gb should be plenty
[07:31] <nearst> hihi
[07:31] <miroesq> nearst, well, the card came up, so that is a big improvement, but it is still not working. think i have to configure it again or something, but made a HUGE step forward. thanks so much!
[07:31] <meet> ok but out of the 20gb giving 6gb is a little too much for me.. even though i would want to hibernate. so 2gb will do?
[07:31] <summeyte> Thank you dr_willis - the bios on this laptop isn't cooperating and I want to add a USB Stick option to Grub
[07:32] <dr_willis> summeyte:  not sure if that will work. but i guess you can try
[07:32] <summeyte> This is the first time I have had an issue so I am not familiar with it
[07:32] <nearst> miroesq, nice. maybe your last working kernel is default=4
[07:33] <miroesq> nearst, i could try it.
[07:33] <nearst> summeyte, u mean boot from iso loop?
[07:33] <summeyte> I have the bios set to boot from USB but it doesn't see the USB stick.
[07:33] <savagecroc> what is the difference between addgroup groupname and addgroup --system groupname?
[07:33] <meet> dr_willis: i go for 2gb swap. so it's showing me 20gb free space. i create a new partition of 18000mbs. location? use as? mount point?
[07:34] <summeyte> I tested the USB stick in another pc and it is working fine
[07:34] <dr_willis> meet:  i said ext4 and '/' for the mountpiint earlier. ;)
[07:34] <meet> oh sorry  forgot :)
[07:34] <nearst> it depends on bios. maybe f9-f12 .. just spam click while boot. lol
[07:35] <summeyte> There is no legacy option
[07:35] <summeyte> lemme try all func keys
[07:35] <samuraibsd> Installing 12.10 via USB.  Install seems to have hung, and I don't remember ever seeing what's going on in the console.  Does it usually take 20 minutes to resize a 1TB drive?
[07:36] <miroesq> nearst, should not have changed it to 4. the system did not come back up
[07:36] <meet> dr_willis can i remove the swap area or reduce it after installation if i am not using hibernate ?
[07:36] <summeyte> It's F7 on this machine and even when you select USB it still boots to Grub.
[07:36] <nearst> miroesq, ouh. okk.
[07:36] <dr_willis> meet:  you can set up a swap file if you want to change sawp around
[07:37] <dr_willis> my 8gb box rarely touches swap during normal ussage
[07:37] <miroesq> nearst, we should have quit while we were ahead
[07:38] <meet> dr_willis ok created the partitions. i select the 18gb partition and click install?
[07:38] <dr_willis> 18gb should be mounted to /   2gb  as swap. and  then continue with the install
[07:39] <meet> ok. btw what are the other options like /home etc?
[07:39] <daniel6644> does anyone have any experiance with bumble bee. when I follow the ubuntu wiki instructions for instralling the proprietery drivers. after boot I get a black screen with a flashing underscore in the top left corner

[07:40] <Grievre> So I have ubuntu set up to boot straight into desktop, however I want it to boot into xfce, not unity
[07:40] <Grievre> (I have xubuntu-desktop installed)
[07:40] <Grievre> how can I achieve this
[07:40] <dr_willis> meet:  you can set up other partions tgo be specific system directories
[07:40] <BWMerlin> Nvidia has updated their official driver release, how long does it take for that then to appear in the ubuntu repositories?
[07:40] <dr_willis> meet:  /home is a common one for that
[07:41] <miroesq> nearst, my friend is going to go to the server's location now. is there a program that we can use to fix this grub issue?
[07:41] <bentinata> anybode knows NetBeansIDE?
[07:42] <kepler> i know it exists. what's the issue?
[07:42] <Grievre> ..really?
[07:42] <nearst> miroesq, what grub issue?
[07:42] <meet> dr_willis so where are all the softwares and games installed?
[07:42] <dr_willis> meet:  on your system drive  ie: /
[07:42] <miroesq> nearst, my system will no longer boot after we changed default to 4
[07:43] <nearst> miroesq, owh. change default=2 then update-grub then reboot
[07:43] <nearst> miroesq, thought u have 3 kernel
[07:43] <miroesq> i can't change it as the system is not booting
[07:43] <dr_willis> 4 would be the 5th kernel..
[07:44] <miroesq> nearst, i thought i had 3, but then again, this is the first time i deal with linux and grub
[07:44] <miroesq> nearst, like i said, i am doing a whole lot of searching and reading
[07:44] <nearst> maybe. im guess now ur linux boot at recovery mode
[07:44] <miroesq> nearst, now it is not booting. any way we can correct this?
[07:44] <bentinata> anyone know java?
[07:45] <dr_willis> !java | bentinata
[07:45] <ubottu> bentinata: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[07:45] <miroesq> nearst, maybe if he holds the shift button while booting?
[07:45] <bentinata> thanks, dr_willis
[07:45] <meet> dr_willis how long will the installation take? :D
[07:45] <kepler> just ask questions, dont ask about asking!
[07:46] <nearst> miroesq, shift button?
[07:46] <dr_willis> meet:  depends on your system perhaps 45 min
[07:46] <meet> dr_willis ok.. and after installation.. will grub replace my win7 bootloader?
[07:47] <miroesq> nearst, i read you can select which kernel to boot by holding the shift while booting
[07:47] <dr_willis> meet:  thats its job.. yes
[07:47] <meet> so it will list windows 7 in that list?
[07:47] <summeyte> If I can log into Ubuntu, is there a way to initiate a re-install?
[07:47] <dr_willis> meet:  thats its job.. yes....
[07:47] <meet> :)
[07:47] <dr_willis> summeyte:  reinsall what?
[07:47] <miroesq> nearst, well is there any fix for this situation or am i screwed and will just have to wipe out the system and start all over again?
[07:47] <meet> dr_willis any way to edit the grub menu?
[07:47] <summeyte> ubuntu
[07:47] <dr_willis> meet:  yes
[07:48] <dr_willis> miroesq:  the grub menu shoulkd have an entry for EVERY kernel you have insgtalled
[07:48] <meet> dr_willis could you suggest any tool?
[07:48] <dr_willis> !grub | meet

[07:49] <dr_willis> you havent even gotten the system installed.. why are you worried about grub ;)
[07:49] <nearst> haha
[07:49] <miroesq> dr_willis: unfortunately, I can't check any more as the system is no longer booting. i do have a copy of the grub.cfg if taht would help
[07:49] <summeyte> I have a screwed up 64bit install and want to reinstall 32bit ubuntu.  Since I have installed Ubuntu I am no longer able to boot from the USB stick.
[07:49] <dr_willis> miroesq:  whats not booting about it? it should get to the grub menu reguardless of what kernel you have selected as default
[07:49] <dr_willis> the grub menu loads BEFOR the kernel does
[07:49] <meet> dr_willis i prefer less options on that boot screen.. :)
[07:50] <nearst> meet, it was tough
[07:50] <bentinata> summeyte, why you can't boot from usb?
[07:50] <summeyte> Good question
[07:50] <miroesq> dr_willis: I selected a kernel that does not exist. I set default to 2 and it booted into my previous kernel and worked. i thenn changed it to 4 and now it did not boot
[07:50] <summeyte> That is the whole issue
[07:51] <bentinata> summeyte, it should able to boot from usb, even you have ubuntu installed on your pc
[07:51] <dr_willis> miroesq:  and if you can see the pc's screen. you should be able to see a grub menu (hold shift as it boots if grub is hidden) and then select whatever kernel you want..
[07:51] <miroesq> dr_willis: unfortunately, i am in a remote location. my friend is theer now, i will have him do that and see what happens. thanks
[07:51] <summeyte> I am able to hit F7 and tell it to use the USB stick (which works) and it still goes to Grub2
[07:52] <summeyte> What I mean by works is the USB stick can be put in a different laptop and it boots to ubuntu fine
[07:52] <bentinata> summeyte, try go to BIOS setting
[07:52] <summeyte> Done that already
[07:52] <dr_willis> miroesq:  i have to wonder what app broke by the kernel update
[07:53] <nearst> dr_willis, owh. idk bout shift button.
[07:53] <bentinata> summeyte, and put usb on first line?
[07:53] <dr_willis> the whole hide grub by default.. is annoying. :) and makes support just a bit harder
[07:53] <dr_willis> they could at least put a message 'Hold shift to see grub menu..............'
[07:54] <summeyte> Yes.  I have done this before.  Never encountered an issue where the USB is first and it still go to grub unless my usb key wasn't setup correctly
[07:54] <miroesq> dr_willis: no app broke the kernel update. the kernel update broke an app, netborder express from sangoma for my sangoma telephony card.
[07:55] <dr_willis> miroesq:  you sure you just dont need to reinstgall/recompile some module for that device for the newer kernel?
[07:56] <miroesq> dr_willis: that could have been the case, but i am not that technically inclined
[07:57] <miroesq> dr_willis: not in linux :)
[07:57] <nearst> im agree. maybe ur problem with some module use in sangoma ip-pbx
[07:57] <dr_willis> check the old kernel that works and see  what modules its loading via 'lsmod' compare to a non working kernel.   there may be a simple way to install the proper modules that would get it working with all the  kernels
[07:57] <miroesq> dr_willis: woohoo we got the system up.
[07:57] <dr_willis> ive no idea what modules that gizmo would use
[07:58] <miroesq> dr_willis: one minute and i will correct the kernel boot option and let you know

[07:58] <miroesq> dr_willis: just no linux
[07:58] <dr_willis> daniel6644:  why do you need mesa utils?

[08:27] <summeyte> dr_willis, I think I know what the issue is now.  When Ubuntu installed EFI support was built into Grub.  It's not on the USB drive.  So there is no way that I can see to disable EFI in the bios (UEFI) and it's not booting from the USB key because it doesn't have any settings for UEFI

[08:33] <wildc4rd> blkadder, interestingly, in nautilus the server doesn't show up at all in the 'browse network' area when on wifi, but does the moment I plug in
[08:34] <kepler> wildc4rd, does you're router have some kind of setting to keep wireless separate?
[08:34] <miroesq_> dr_willis: i got it to work, by going back to the old kernel and reinstalling the deb package. i have auto update for security upgrades enabled. can you pls tell me how to turn that off so this does not happen again?
[08:35] <wildc4rd> kepler, not that I know of, same IP range, I'll check again though
[08:35] <dr_willis> miroesq_:  reinstalling what deb package?
[08:35] <kepler> are you able to ping and/or port scan the server?

[08:52] <kepler> wildc4rd, what about when wired? (i assume the same, but may as well look!)

[08:52] <wildc4rd> kepler, yes, its the same
[08:53] <jil> I have a fresh ubuntu install where I created another account. But I can give that account a password.  I don't get it.
[08:53] <kepler> how are you trying to access it?
[08:54] <kepler> on wireless, if you just open whatever file browser you use, and do smb://<ip>/  does it show up?
[08:54] <dr_willis> jil:  rephrase that. its not clear

[08:55] <BillyZane> kepler, i'm not sure if this is true, but i heard that kepler was a huge failure before he made his 3 laws
[08:55] <kepler> most people are failures until they do something important :P
[08:55] <BillyZane> you can never count anyone out
[08:55] <bentinata> someone have facebook/twitter/google+ here?
[08:55] <BillyZane> the only real failure is to stop trying
[08:56] <bekks> bentinata: Why?
[08:56] <dr_willis> bentinata: i imagine most do
[08:56] <jil> I created a second account on my home computer. It has no password now. When I go to preference-- account to add a password, the validating button stays innacessible.
[08:56] <bentinata> bekks, just be friends :)
[08:56] <dr_willis> jil:  try the command line way perhaps
[08:57] <bentinata> jil, passwd
[08:57] <dr_willis> jil:  sudo adduser billgates           or
[08:57] <dr_willis> sudo passwd theusername
[08:57] <bentinata> jil, "sudo passwd"
[08:57] <wildc4rd> kepler, the folder was shared in ubuntu by right click/share then setting permissions, when wired it shows up in nautilus, I have a shortcut to the folder. When on wifi the shortcut shows the error 'Could not display smb://<server name>/shared/<folder name>' Error: Invalid Argument
[08:58] <kepler> so you're able to access it while not using that shortcut?
[08:58] <wildc4rd> via wired, yes, via wifi, no
[08:59] <jil> Ok, I didn't want to use this technic because I want the other users to be able to update themselves their password and they are close to computer illiterate.
[08:59] <dr_willis> try  smb://the.ip.of.server/  perhaps
[09:00] <jil> But let me look into it maybe if I fixe the firts password, they will be able to change it easily.
[09:00] <jil> Thankyou bentinata, dr_willis
[09:00] <kepler> so going to the address bar and typing in smb://<server>/shared doesn't work while on wifi?
[09:00] <dr_willis> jil: i just use adduser and it always asks for a password
[09:00] <dr_willis> no idea wht the gui tool messed up
[09:01] <jil> Ok, I have a lot of problems on my fresh install. I trying to adress them one by one.
[09:02] <wildNBK> kepler, no
[09:02] <kepler> that is just weird :/
[09:03] <wildNBK> Indeed, hence why I'm here asking the question, lol
[09:03] <kepler> what router or ap are you using?
[09:03] <kepler> nvm, if you can see 139 open, it should work
[09:03] <kepler> both machines are ubuntu?
[09:04] <wildNBK> both machines are on 12.10, its a cisco wag something
[09:05] <miroesq_> I have my ubuntu server 10.04 set to automatically install security updates. how do i disable this feature?
[09:07] <dr_willis> ive seen  cases where in nautilus the smb://servername/  dosent work but smb://the.ip.of.server/  does work
[09:08] <dr_willis> could be its somehow cacheing the ip of the server when its wired. but not when its on wireless (or its using the wrong cache)
=== yann_ is now known as Yann_L1
[09:13] <summeyte> Figured out what was going on with Grub and USB key not booting.
[09:14] <summeyte> At least a theory
[09:15] <summeyte> It appears the 32 Ubuntu 12.10 doesn't include support for EFI so when you try to boot from the thumb drive it is ignored
[09:15] <summeyte> The 64 bit 12.10 works fine.
[09:16] <dr_willis> never heard of that limit to 32bit ubuntu
[09:16] <dr_willis> but i basically only use 64bit these days
[09:16] <bekks> Because it does not exist.
[09:16] <dr_willis> could be a quirk of his MB/efi setup?
[09:16] <bekks> Yes.

[09:29] <DBoyz> yeah. that's the issue. where is the flash plugins directory?
[09:29] <ioria> DBoyz: go to /usr/lib and you should have or an abobe-flashplayer directory or a flashplugin-installer directory
[09:29] <jil> and my machine crashes more than with windows.  arg..

[09:31] <jil> and at the same time I tryed to reinstall for the x time the flashplugin. The dowload will not even start.
[09:32] <DBoyz> jil: just download the tar.gz file manually
[09:32] <jil> DBoyz, that what I was trying to do...
[09:33] <DBoyz> and by the way i am not able to help you with the crash report
[09:33] <ioria> DBoyz: go to /usr/lib
[09:33] <jil> I agree with you that I have a buggy software.  I want to reinstall it but I need to make my dowload works perfectly .
[09:33] <jil> too
[09:33] <DBoyz> ioria: found it /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer
[09:34] <jil> is there a more technical channel ?

[09:47] <Lebby> hi! I have a dream :). I want to use the same pc wifi interface  (i.e wlan0 ) to connect on other AP ( that has internet ) and works as AP simultaneously. In windows I can do by a VirtualWifi/SoftAp ... how i can do it in Ubuntu?
[09:48] <DBoyz> <--
[09:50] <Eagleman> Is there another way to use smtpd_relay_restrictions or something similiar in postfix?
[09:50] <llutz> Lebby: have you tried using hostapd?
[09:52] <ioria> Eagleman: what do you wanna do exactly ?
[09:53] <Eagleman> ioria, a better question would be on how to do this:  local clients and authenticated clients may specify any destination domain.
[09:53] <llutz> Eagleman: its not implemented in the stable branch now, afaik
[09:54] <Lebby> llutz: y ... but i don't know how to connect simultaneously with same interface to internet
[09:54] <llutz> Lebby: you need to create a 2nd, virtual, device in master-mode
[09:55] <Lebby> llutz: i want this: internet<-wlan0 ( pc) -> other mobile
[09:55] <Lebby> llutz:  that's right way .... ok ! How ?
[09:56] <llutz> Lebby: what chipset? i know that old atheros chips could do it, no idea about actual/different chipsets
[09:56] <Lebby> llutz: finally i find 1 that push me on right way .... i tried it ... but i failed ... so can u give me some tips/link to create a virtual device in ubuntu?
[09:56] <Eagleman> How can i achieve this on postfix?:  local clients and authenticated clients may specify any destination domain.
[09:56] <Eagleman> :q!
[09:57] <Lebby> Eagleman:  you can do it by postfix .conf .... local_recipeints settings
[09:57] <Lebby> Eagleman:  and destination_somethin ( i don't remember .... )
[09:58] <Lebby> llutz:  i tried using iw command but i'm pretty sure that i did it wrong ... because when i launch hostap ... it crash
[09:58] <llutz> Lebby: term to search might be " multiple interface support "
[09:59] <Lebby> llutz: ty
[09:59] <llutz> Lebby: so again, what chipset/driver are you using?
[10:00] <TAFB> do they have ubuntu for the Tegra 3? http://ncix.com/products/?sku=78777

[10:22] <NaGeL> ioria, i just tried putty with another SSH that i have and that wrked just fine. and i installed it please quit repeating that.
[10:24] <ioria> NaGel: ok.... sorry did you run the ssh configuration on 7 ?
[10:25] <ioria> NaGel: or the correct key on putty ?

Frustrated, I decided to give ubuntu a spin. Upon booting up my new ubuntu, I open  terminal and sudo apt-get install wine. This is the output:  wine : Depends: wine1.4 but it is not going to be installed. how do I get wine to install, please?

[11:22] <anomalous> running now. sorry, new to ubuntu
[11:23] <anomalous> Slart: unity seems rather unresponsive, especially when i hit the windows key for the unity menu thing. Will updating all packages likely address this?
[11:24] <anomalous> Slart: in fact, even using ubuntu software center or gnome-terminal, they fade to gray an hang for a couple seconds, very frequently

[11:45] <Guest7269> Hello. On Ubuntu 12.04, using suspend with Nvidia 294 drivers causes graphic corruption when waking up, fixed by logging out and in.  What is the fix and why does this happen in Unity?
[11:45] <MonkeyDust> anomalous  32bit does work on 64bit hardware, but better use 64bit
[11:45] <petergk> re
[11:45] <Guest7269> This is a critical error.
[11:45] <anomalous> MonkeyDust: so, i should get a 32bit or 64bit 12.10 disk? your typing was somewhat ambiguous there
[11:46] <OerHeks> anomalous, flash works fine, but depends on your hardware, i guess
[11:46] <Guest7269> anomalous: 64 bit
[11:46] <Guest7269> 32 bit is inferior.
[11:47] <k1l> anomalous: if your hardware can handle 64 bit go for it
[11:47] <anomalous> it's also 'recommended' from the download page, and thus far ubuntu has been as practical as a brick in a dishwasher
[11:47] <Atum> Does anybody knows if the ati legacy driver has been updated to run tf2 on linux?
[11:47] <k1l> anomalous: its recommended on the downloadpage because there is still only32bit hardware out there
[11:48] <anomalous> Atum: incidentally, 12.10 will break  unity with ATI legacy drivers,
[11:48] <k1l> anomalous: so again: if your hardware is capable of 64bit go for it
[11:48] <ngomes> hello , in dpkg --get-selections i have all packages marked as "deinstall" how can i revert this ?
[11:48] <Guest7269> Why is unity broken with official drivers?
[11:49] <k1l> Guest7269: its not
[11:49] <Guest7269> k1l: It corrupts image when resuming from suspsend. Suspsend is unusable.
[11:49]  * anomalous is going to petition devs to rename distro 'ubrokentu' or 'ublundertu' or 'umadamistake'
[11:50] <k1l> Guest7269: maybe the module is not loaded right after the suspend.
[11:50] <Guest7269> What am I supposed to do?
[11:50] <Guest7269> It should just work. It works in Ubuntu 10.10
[11:50] <Atum> anomalous: It is broken with 12.04 aswell, atleast last time I checked, it was.
[11:50] <k1l> anomalous: are you here for flaming? or do you have a actual support issue?
[11:50] <Guest7269> What's the problem with unity
[11:50] <anomalous> don't mind my bitterness/sinnicism, 6:50am on my birthday, haven't slept, wubi is breaking around me, now compiz is glitching the alpha on the screen

[12:01] <ManDrake> bazhang, I think it switched me to Unity. Everything I can find on-line seems to work.
[12:01] <ChronicleX> Squarism:  you can run ubuntu on windows as a native application
[12:02] <bazhang> ChronicleX, wubi?
[12:02] <Squarism> ChronicleX, oh.. nice.. where can i download that?
[12:02] <ChronicleX> bazhang : yup
[12:02] <ChronicleX> Squarism:  use wubi installer
[12:02] <bazhang> ChronicleX, thats not quite correct
[12:03] <MonkeyDust> Squarism  it's called wubi, a pseudo-installation, better don't start struggling with it
[12:03] <ChronicleX> bazhang : yup in terms of installation it is correct
[12:03] <bekks> ChronicleX: No, it isnt.
[12:03] <ChronicleX> but to use ubuntu we have to choose ubuntu from the boot options
[12:03] <ChronicleX> means it will be like dual booting
[12:04] <ChronicleX> bekks : how ?
[12:04] <bekks> ChronicleX: It's not dualbooting, it just starts Ubuntu from within a container file on your native windows installation.
[12:05] <ChronicleX> bekks : yeah it won't be dual booting and ubuntu will be added to windows bootloader
[12:05] <bekks> ChronicleX: Then please dont tell people it is like dualbooting ;)
[12:05] <k1l_> ChronicleX: the problem is that wubi install is tied to the windows. so if a problem in windows accurs its messing up ubunut too
[12:05] <ChronicleX> bekks :) okies
[12:05] <k1l_> ChronicleX: so its not a good choice for a replacment of a real install
[12:06] <ChronicleX> bekks : i was trying to give just simple ans. .
[12:06] <MonkeyDust> ChronicleX  another user got terribly frustrated by wubi, just minutes ago
[12:06] <ChronicleX> just didn't want to go into details
[12:06] <petergk> wubi is an image loader as I see
[12:07] <ChronicleX> MonkeyDust: i did gave it try .. yea its really frustrating but for windows people ..it can be simple as installing other apps

[12:27] <Benxyzzy> What does this mean? As in, what's the number in the square brackets and letters/stars/dashes in the round brackets?
[12:27] <lantizia> I know 12.04 can see NTFS partitions out-of-the-box (no packages to install)... can it also see exFAT out of the box?  and if yes - which (if I had ONLY the choice of the two) am I better formatting something as for performance/stability
[12:28] <Abhijit> riddlebox, amm? graphics card has nothing to do with 32-64bit. its the processor which is either 32bit or 64 bit
[12:28] <riddlebox> Abhijit: well earlier I was told that the lag in unity could be my graphics driver...
[12:29] <Abhijit> riddlebox, it could be. using 64 bit processor for video processing is recommonded over 32 bit.
[12:29] <Abhijit> riddlebox, ask proper question with all the details.
[12:30] <riddlebox> Abhijit: when I use 64bit ubuntu unity is very laggy..I press the dash key and wait 5 seconds until it opens. I am trying to figure out what could cause the lag.

[13:07] <Abhijit> Baribal, alami Confusion was due to same pronounciation. I thought you are talking about this http://www.freecol.org/
[13:08] <floogy> Ah, ok the drive reapears now with wodim --devices, but it's still unreponsive.
[13:08] <Baribal> Okay, downloaded the i386 package, tried dpkg -i: dependency problems - leaving unconfigured    So is there a way to install it through apt?
[13:08] <alami> i mean freecall.com phone software
[13:08] <floogy> eject: unable to eject, last error: Inappropriate ioctl for device
[13:09] <MonkeyDust> Baribal  guess you have to install ia32-libs-multiarch

[13:11] <userlain> Is there a difference in repositry availability between Ubuntu/Kubuntu and Xubuntu/Lubuntu?
[13:12] <Marlinc> No

[13:14] <userlain> But I am running it on a Celeron laptop from 2008, and this machine has 1GB of ram.
[13:14] <userlain> So... resources are limited.
[13:15] <nearst> use antiX
[13:15] <userlain> Kubuntu is suprisingly quick, but I'm wondering if my user experience would be better on Xubuntu or Lubuntu.
[13:15] <Abhijit> userlain, use lxde or xfce
[13:15] <MonkeyDust> atix is nice, i have it in virtualbox
[13:15] <BluesKaj> Davst, you have to setup your audiuo outputs to use the (I'm assuming here) pci graphics to tramsfer the audio from alsa , I use pavucontrol to make thast connection
[13:15] <MonkeyDust> antix*
[13:16] <nearst> !pavucontrol | Davst
[13:16] <Davst> Blues: well its the same SPDIF since its a 9800GT which has a spdif piggyback
[13:17] <Davst> BluesKaj: the spdif digital output still shows up in ubuntu and so. I just dont get any sound anmore
=== reo_ is now known as Guest57983
[13:18] <cfhowlett> userlain, both are official repos and xubuntu is also the foundation of ubuntu studio.  xubuntu is arguably the more mature of the two distros.  I've 've xfce and lxde and found little difference is operating speeds
[13:18] <cfhowlett> userlain, that said, you can install lxde or xfce on your vanilla ubuntu and test them youself
[13:18] <BluesKaj> yes Davst what's your audio chip in alasamixer ?
[13:19] <phong_> how to make a link shortcut in ubuntu

[13:22] <userlain> Is the difference between a x.04 to x.10 release just the default packages?
[13:22] <userlain> Besides x.04 usually being LTS?
[13:23] <BluesKaj> Davst, run , sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel , there will be no output from that command if the kernel module loads properly . We have to make sure driver/module is loaded by using that command, then reboot
[13:24] <Davst> BluesKaj: one sec

=== lwb__ is now known as lwbailey
[13:26] <MonkeyDust> userlain  every 2 years, .04 is an LTS
[13:27] <MonkeyDust> userlain  find reviews to see 'what's new' in the different releases
[13:27] <Baribal> userlain, also, not just the default packages, but available packages too. I.e. 12.10 comes with MAAS, in case you want to build a datacenter.
[13:29] <bentinata> what command you use to wait?
[13:30] <Davst> BluesKaj: loaded the module, no feedback, rebooted.. still nothing =/
[13:32] <BluesKaj> Davst,  have you installed pavucontrol ?
[13:33] <Davst> BluesKaj: yeah
[13:33] <jabba_> hello
[13:34] <BluesKaj> did you setup the output to use spdif , Davst ?
[13:35] <jabba_> just tried to prevent my system from loading ohci_hcd, ehci_hcd and xhcd_hcd at boot. so i added these modules to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, did a update-initramfs -u and rebootet. but: modules where still loaded.
[13:35] <Davst> BluesKaj: yeah
[13:35] <jabba_> any idea?
[13:35] <BluesKaj> if so Davst , you should change it to hdmi if the option is there
[13:36] <Davst> BluesKaj: only SPDIF available (probably since the card only supports piggybacking the onboard sound spdif out to the hdmi)
[13:36] <MonkeyDust> jabba_  ubuntu server?
[13:37] <jabba_> MonkeyDust: yes
[13:37] <MonkeyDust> jabba_  they have their own channel    #ubuntu-server
[13:37] <bentinata> what command use to wait?
[13:37] <jabba_> MonkeyDust: is that so much difference?
[13:37] <llutz> bentinata: sleep, wait
[13:38] <Davst> BluesKaj: tbh I'm starting to consider buying a newer gfx card that has a on graphics card soundcard, this piggyback thing is not working at all
[13:38] <bentinata> llutz, sipp

[13:41] <BluesKaj> Davst, let me describe my setup , I use an nvidia graphics card using the nvidia-current driver which can take the audio and send it down the hdmi ...your use of proprietrary might be the problem
[13:42] <llutz> nubley: do they, usually dropbear is used
[13:42] <Davst> BluesKaj: eh.. nvidia-current is the proprietary driver i mean
[13:42] <Davst> BluesKaj: considering its closed source and from nvidia.
[13:42] <nubley> Thanks
[13:43] <Davst> BluesKaj: difference seems that i have audio passthrough and not a actual soundcard on the gfxcard like the newer ones do
[13:44] <Davst> BluesKaj: thanks for the help, I'm just gonna try tossing in a cheap newer htpc card from nvidia.. running to the store =P might be back later =)

[13:52] <yaman> i want to install back track tools on ubuntu and for that i have downloaded some script.. but in terminal while i try to access it shows no such file or directory foung help pls
[13:54] <Free99> hey everyone. Having an issue with an old library that is no longer in the repositories. I need to run Pro/Engineer 3 on 12.04 x64, but it depends on libgtk1.2 for the i386
[13:54] <yaman>  i want to install back track tools on ubuntu and for that i have downloaded some script.. but in terminal while i try to access it shows no such file or directory found
[13:55] <ichat> Free99:  - so download the libs source and compile it agains your new system ;
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest40178
[13:55] <Free99> ichat: ok. I've compiled stuff before, but do I need to do any special prefix commands on the ./configure or anything?
[13:56] <Free99> also, it needs to be 32 bit
[13:56] <Free99> despite my being on a 64 bit system
[13:56] <ichat> Free99 - hmmz that makes stuf more interesting... i dont know
[13:57] <ichat> i would suspact that youd have to have  32bit base packages / runtimes than as well - but my knowledge doesn go that for
[13:58] <Free99> ichat: well, the plus side is that the 32-bit libs work except for one package, specifically libgtk1.2-common... it says it will work for all archs, but the libgtk1.2:i386 claims it can't find it (I think because it's not i386 specific)
[14:00] <Free99> I'm sorry, I should be more specific: libgtk1.2-common is depended on by libgtk1.2:i386. but the common is for all architectures, and libgtk1.2:i386 says that common cannot be found
[14:00] <Free99> so ichat: where do I get the source for this? on launchpad?
[14:01] <ichat> free  i supposed that you would have to  isntalled them in a diferent   path from the ubuntu  packages and  during compling you might need do  change the vars accordingly...
[14:02] <ichat> free usually  compling stuff  you would have to define where the dependancies are  if not in default location ... thats probably why it couldnt find them
[14:04] <Free99> ichat: ok. I'll try working on this. I found the source on launchpad. Thanks
[14:04] <yaman>  i want to install back track tools on ubuntu and for that i have downloaded some script.. but in terminal while i try to access it shows no such file or directory found

[14:15] <nearst> nearst, lsmod, check your wireless module
[14:15] <BWMerlin> anyone had experience installing the nvidia drivers for linux straight from the nvidia website?
[14:15] <MonkeyDust> BWMerlin  about everyone, better use ubuntu's nvidia drivers (i have intel myself)
[14:16] <zyngawow> nearst, I dont see any wireless module there
[14:17] <user1_> i think i will erase ubuntu and go with fedora and slackware - ubuntu is making my ssd disk and 8GB memory on netbook really shaky. hope threading and overclocking does not happen with slackware
[14:18] <BWMerlin> MonkeyDust: I currently do but nvidia have released newer drivers and no-one has answered my question as to how long it takes for them to appear in the ubuntu repository
[14:18] <nearst> zyngawow, what wireless hardware u have ? sudo apt-get install iw && iw phy
[14:18] <MonkeyDust> BWMerlin  maybe because nobody knows
[14:18] <nearst> user1_, try nomodeset at grub option
[14:18] <himanshu_linux> hi

[14:19] <MonkeyDust> user1_  that's the freedom of choice in linux - distro's not what you want? try another
[14:19] <himanshu_linux> i am not able to make a wifi hotspot. i am using ubuntu 12.04
[14:19] <zyngawow> nearst, iw phy -> nl80211 not found.
[14:20] <himanshu_linux> how to make a wifi hotspot ??
[14:20] <user1_> nearst : http://askubuntu.com/questions/207175/what-does-nomodeset-do
[14:20] <nearst> zyngawow, sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source
[14:20] <zyngawow> nearst, :) will do
[14:21] <nearst> user1_, ?

[14:22] <user1_> MonkeyDust:  my system's noise has become untolerable.  do you know which actually is very strict when it comes to keeping the CPU fan ram and kernel healthy and noise free.  slackware or fedora?
[14:22] <user1_> nearst: i mean he says it wont start
[14:23] <nearst> user1_, idk what ur problem in detail. it cloudy case
[14:24] <ChronicleX> same prob here user1

[14:24] <himanshu_linux> llutz : ok seeing the link
[14:24] <user1_> nearst : noise. it seems my cpu is tortured by flash and firefox . it suddenly makes noise like it's taking off the runway
[14:25] <bekks> user1_: RAM is there to be used. Non-used RAM is wasted RAM. :)
[14:25] <ChronicleX> very noisy sys.  harddisk , cpu keeps makin un tolerable  noise

[14:28] <lionrouge> hi
[14:28] <ChronicleX> lionrouge hi
[14:28] <lionrouge> i had Ubuntu 12.10. Then reinstalled Windows 7 (it erased grub). Then i tried to repair it and it's going weird
[14:29] <BluesKaj> ChronicleX, most likely your cooling fans
[14:29] <insertable> My hdd was getting really noisy, booting the laptop was taking 4 1/2 minutes. Switched to ssd I get no noise and 19 second boot time. nice
[14:29] <foggyspider> hi
[14:29] <lionrouge> i don't like grub 2 cause i can't easily edit it's config
[14:30] <lionrouge> now i have 2 groups of ubuntu related entries in my grub list
[14:30] <insertable> lionrouge, yeah Windows takes over the MBR
[14:30] <lionrouge> and the first (the old one) oesn't work
[14:30] <insertable> You should install windows first, then Linux
[14:30] <lionrouge> otherwise there is smth. wronh with the disks
[14:30] <ChronicleX> BluesKaj:  cooling fans works fine ..  i've been running same laptop for 2 years
[14:31] <ChronicleX> this problem arose some day back ..
[14:31] <lionrouge> in /etc/fstab all lines are commented
[14:31] <ChronicleX> don't know what happend .. i checked out fans, hdd, ram.
[14:31] <lionrouge> and there are disks in /media that are indicated with long ASCII rubbish
[14:31] <ChronicleX> didn't find anything suspicious
[14:32] <zyngawow_> nearst, I did what you said. Same.
[14:32] <BluesKaj> lionrouge, http://members.iinet.net/~herman546/p20/GRUB2%20Configuration%20File%20Commands.html
[14:32] <lionrouge> i used this guide to repair grub: http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repairrestorereinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd/
[14:33] <BluesKaj> ChronicleX, checked the power settings etc?
[14:33] <davidloo> hello
[14:34] <ChronicleX> Bluekaj:  yes .. i did. .. ..it happens specially in ubuntu .. i'm running mint as an alternative (dual boot)
[14:34] <user1_> i have got ssd but it's noise has added. i dont know if it's cpu or ram or ssd but there are two noises.
[14:34] <iLogical> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1523809/  how is it possible that I have two partitions with 1TB? I have only 1TB of memory
[14:34] <nearst> zyngawow_, try with proprietary driver?
[14:34] <user1_> grub is so bad that when you type halt it hangs!!!!
[14:34] <bekks> user1_: Does your RAM has a cooler?
[14:35] <zyngawow_> nearst, it also doesnt work..
[14:35] <user1_> bekks : RAM cooler now what's that? i have one fan
[14:35] <bekks> iLogical: You have 1TB space, not RAM.
[14:35] <bekks> user1_: So your RAM cant make any noise...
[14:35] <iLogical> that's what i meant
[14:36] <user1_> bekks : and what's this take on and take off the runway sound. who's making it.
[14:36] <swissbox> .
[14:36] <bekks> iLogical: An extended partition is a container. It contains a logical partition.
[14:36] <ChronicleX>  user1_  : maybe ur hdd?
[14:36] <bekks> user1_: The cooler.
[14:36] <nomnex> swissbox, get out of here
[14:36] <swissbox> how?
[14:36] <nearst> zyngawow_, check on http://askubuntu.com/questions/127633/how-do-i-get-a-broadcom-bcm4313-wireless-card-working
[14:36] <iLogical> ok
[14:37] <swissbox> .
[14:37] <user1_> bekks: you mean the fan? why is it making it. why is ubuntu telling it to move faster. the room is already chilled.
[14:37] <altair> ciao a tutti. esiste un programma come riot per windows da poter utilizzare invece su ubuntu o cmq su una distro linux? riot permette di ridurre formato e dimensione di una serie di immagini in maniera del tutto automatica e applicando le modifiche per tutti i files contenuti in una cartella o selezionati.
[14:38] <anomalous> Hello.
[14:38] <bekks> user1_: The fan is a mechanical component. Due to the speed of the rotation it produces an airflow which is audible as "noise".
[14:38] <anomalous> what ATI driver does ubuntu 12.10 64bit use, by default?
[14:38] <bekks> user1_: Do you know what a cooler is for?
[14:38] <ChronicleX> bekks : but how can we adjust its speed manually? is there any way to control those fans?
[14:38] <user1_> bekks: no. where is it located. can we remove it?
=== tensorpuddin is now known as tensorpudding
[14:39] <insertable> user1_, you can use http://packages.ubuntu.com/lm-sensors and http://packages.ubuntu.com/fancontrol to control the fans
[14:39] <bekks> user1_: Removing it will result in overheating your CPU which result in breaking it.
[14:39] <user1_> bekks: so cooler is different from fan and only ubuntu handles it!
[14:39] <niko-nojo> Hi room, I'm having an issue on Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS -   A process called mount.ntfs is consuming ~97% of the CPU . I can't figure out what to do even after trying the suggestions on the Internet. Can anyone help ?
[14:40] <lionrouge> well i can now localize the problem
[14:40] <lionrouge> ubuntu doesn't recognize new Windows 7 partitions properly
[14:40] <bekks> user1_: Nowadays a "cooler" consists of a passive cooling component and an active fan component.
[14:40] <anomalous> what ATI driver does ubuntu 12.10 64bit use, by default?  Additionally, this would be mesa, yes? how do I disable vertical sync with mesa in ubuntu 12.10?
[14:40] <nearst> !grub | lionrouge
[14:40] <ubottu> lionrouge: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows?

[14:42] <user1_> bekks: why does it have to make noise . it only happens with flash and browser
[14:42] <freeaks> where can i get help with ubuntu 13.04 (kernel 3.8) to have my intel gfx chip working ? i only have nvidia with nouveau right now and i want to use the intel discrete chip
[14:42] <yeats> freeaks: #ubuntu+1
[14:42] <freeaks> yeats, thanks
[14:42] <insertable> niko-nojo, ntfs is a windows filesystem (could be a windows partition or even a usb drive formatted as ntfs) - do you have anything mounted like that?
[14:42] <bekks> user1_: Because flash and stuff are CPU-intensive tasks which lead to a higher temperature which leads to higher airflow to cool it down again. Thus the higher noise.
[14:43] <insertable> niko-nojo, typing 'mount' in a terminal will tell you what you currently have mounted and where

[15:40] <mkv_> disharmonic, totem, vlc, xine, avidemux wont play it since i installed
[15:40] <mkv_> disharmonic, ..installed smplayer and w32codecs
[15:41] <mkv_> disharmonic, i tried reinstalling vlc
[15:42] <Timmy> it could not detect my hardware to show me a proprietary driver. i have a radeon hd graphic card
[15:42] <subz3r0> !ati > Timmy
[15:42] <ubottu> Timmy, please see my private message
[15:44] <disharmonic> mkv_, are you sure the file is not corrupted?
[15:47] <BluesKaj> disharmonic, mkv_ says  no mkv files will play ...wonder if he has libdvdecss2 installed
[15:47] <BluesKaj> err libdvdcss2
[15:49] <mkv_> disharmonic, is there an uncorrupted mkv to test?
=== JoFo_ is now known as JoFo
[15:50] <disharmonic> mkv_, have you installed ubuntu-restricted and ubuntu-restriced-extras?
[15:51] <disharmonic> BluesKaj, you sure that is needed for mkvs? Iiirc it's used to decode DVDs
[15:51] <mkv_> disharmonic, think i did, how do i check?
[15:52] <BluesKaj> disharmonic, it's for stripping the DRM off the file
[15:53] <mkv_> disharmonic, sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted ubuntu-restriced-extras Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done E: Couldn't find package ubuntu-restricted
[15:53] <escott> BluesKaj, but why would an mkv file have css?
[15:54] <BluesKaj> mkv_, ubuntu-restricted-extras
[15:54] <yoopi> hi all
[15:54] <mkv_> sry, Blueskaj, just saw missing t
[15:55] <mkv_> sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done ubuntu-restricted-extras is already the newest version. 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.BluesKaj, disharmonic
[15:55] <disharmonic> hmm
[15:55] <disharmonic> you can download legal mkvs from vo.do
[15:56] <disharmonic> to try
[15:56] <disharmonic> mkv_, that's a website btw
[15:57] <mkv_> BluesKaj, disharmonic, it hink the mkv file might really be crooked, just tested a test file, worked, WHAT website?
[15:57] <subz3r0> vo.do
[15:58] <BluesKaj> escott, good question , but I've encoutered a few that wouldn't play until i installed libdvdcss2 by installing th erestricted-extras
[15:58] <subz3r0> libdvdcss2 for mkv's?
[15:58] <subz3r0> not really
[15:58] <disharmonic> mkv_, what subz3r0 said
[15:58] <BluesKaj> it's actually a good reminder toi do so , escott
[15:58] <mkv_> sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2 Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done libdvdcss2 is already the newest version. 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded. disharmonic, BluesKaj
[15:59] <subz3r0> you dont need libdvdcss2 for mkv/mp4 with x264
[15:59] <subz3r0> libdvdcss2 is for the copy protection of dvds... and its illegal in some countries. so be aware of that
[15:59] <disharmonic> mkv_, yeah makes sense since you have restricted-extras. libdvdcss2 is for DVD playback anyway
[16:00] <subz3r0> disharmonic: agreed
[16:00] <_helios_> I don't think any code should be illegal in any country that's just ridiculous.
[16:00] <BluesKaj> subz3r0, so you say , but some DRM files are left behind in my experience
[16:00] <escott> installing restricted-extras does not actually install decss, but i dont think you should need it for anything but  a direct drive image
[16:00] <subz3r0> _helios_ that's not the point
[16:01] <_helios_> subz3r0, I know I'm just tired of governments telling people what software they can and cannot have on there computers.
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[16:02] <mkv_> disharmonic, BluesKaj, i maybe quit trying now, i conclude the mkv in question is unplayble, how can I test whether an mkv is crooked or not?
[16:02] <_helios_> Welcome ActionParsnip ;)
[16:02] <ActionParsnip> _helios_: howdy
[16:03] <anomalous> I inadvertently installed the nonlegacy catalyst binary package and fubar'ed my X. How do I uninstall that package?
[16:03] <_helios_> I finally got rid of Windows 7 completaly and switched to xubuntu 12.1064bit haven't had a crash yet,  For some reason on Unity I was getting some crashes.
[16:03] <anomalous> from commandline, i am not too familiar with how to query installed packages
[16:03] <BluesKaj> mkv_, some files are unplayable after being ripped from one video format to another.corrupt maybe ? I've seen a few
[16:04] <ActionParsnip> _Helios_: xfce doesn't use Compiz by default
[16:04] <_helios_> ActionParsnip, so compiz was the culprit?
[16:04] <mkv_> BluesKaj. have u seen my pastebin?
[16:04] <ActionParsnip> Anomalous: how did you install it?
[16:04] <blackthor> dpkg -l = which packages are installed
[16:04] <blackthor> you can grep it with  dpkg -l |grep "name"  ?
[16:05] <blackthor> or use  something like aptitude or etc
[16:05] <ActionParsnip> _Helios_: i'd say it was likely
[16:05] <anomalous> ActionParsnip: through the gui. i don't know the name of the package
[16:05] <BluesKaj> mkv_, , no I was busy for a few mins and missed it
[16:05] <mkv_> BluesKaj wait
[16:06] <ActionParsnip> Anomalous: try: tail -n 20 /var/log/dpkg.log
[16:06] <mkv_> BluesKaj, disharmonic http://pastebin.com/Q8nxby7z
[16:06] <disharmonic> subz3r0, i don't really think it's illegal. It's more like in some countries it's legality is ambiguous as it hasn't been verified in a court
[16:06] <anomalous> ActionParsnip: package is fglrx, how to uninstall from commandline, then?
[16:07] <ActionParsnip> Anomalous: sudo apt-get --purge remove fglrx
[16:08] <D-coy> m4v, are you there?
[16:09] <mikul> Seriously, whats up with flash in ubuntu/xubuntu? i even run 32 bit xubuntu and 32 bit flash this time. And it lags like hell when watching clip and streams.. specially in fullscreen. It works perfect for a while (30 sec to a minute) and then lags like hell and eats up all cpu. But its worse in fullscreen. also xorg is useing quite a lot cpu while flash is running..30-35% is that normal?  What can i do about it?
[16:09] <blackthor> you can stop watching porn :)
[16:09] <ActionParsnip> Mikul: never had an issue. I use Chrome and remove adobe flash

[16:10] <mikul> i use chrome to. but i have same problem in all browsers i'v tested
[16:10] <ActionParsnip> Mikul: what gpu do you have? Have you tried minitube too?
[16:11] <Squarism> I get so depressed. I really wanna use desktop ubuntu but unity just makes it damn impossible. Why cant i reassign "semi-maximize" ? Why does that have to excluded from the shortcuts that can be reassigned?

[16:16] <ActionParsnip> Mikul: so no output from the dpkg, ok. Install minitube and try that
[16:17] <mikul> ActionParsnip, oh, sorry.. synaptic was running.. 2 sec
[16:17] <blackthor> what's minitube ?
[16:19] <mikul> ActionParsnip, strange.. didnt get anything form what you wrote.. but i tried this one and got some results:

[16:29] <escott> SerenE_SparK, if your administrator set up some kind of restriction we are not going to help you get around it
[16:30] <ichat> why does flash even exists ... it should have been replaced by .. html 5  years ago  even   w3c  is ready for html 5  and they are usually the last to egnowledge new technoligies in internet browsing
[16:30] <ActionParsnip> I can't type
[16:30] <Nilton> Olá a todos
[16:30] <SerenE_SparK> escott: it is not allowed to send .bat files via internet because most of the viruses are spread in this way.
[16:30] <ActionParsnip> IChat: html5 doesn't work with flash games
[16:30] <apm1> i just had a freeze on my system
[16:31] <apm1> i had to hardreboot it
[16:31] <nearst> ichat, internet is scary now
[16:31] <ichat> ActionParsnip:  - dending on what you mean by flashgames....   the  canvas  atrib  does it all
[16:31] <ActionParsnip> Apm1: did ctrl+alt+f1 not do anything
[16:31] <ichat> (depending)
[16:31] <apm1> ActionParsnip, i tried switching ttys , no luck
[16:31] <k1l_> ichat: that topic doesnt help the user with his flash problem anyway
[16:32] <ichat> k11_ mea culpa
[16:32] <ActionParsnip> Ichat: like kongregate games

[16:33] <k1l_> ChronicleX: start the lightdm login screen
[16:33] <mikul> ActionParsnip, still same problem
[16:33] <k1l_> ChronicleX: sudo start lightdm
[16:33] <wildc4rd> how do I stop a ping request in terminal, lol
[16:33] <disharmonic> damn vim needs quite a bit of practice
[16:33] <ChronicleX> k1l_:  i guess there is shortcut too   like super+XYZ  or alt+fx+xyz?
[16:33] <BluesKaj> ChronicleX, from the TTY , startx or sudo service lightdm start
[16:34] <k1l_> wildc4rd: ctrl+c
[16:34] <ActionParsnip> Mikul: if you make a fresh ubuntu user, is it the same there?
[16:34] <k1l_> ChronicleX: so you are in console?
[16:35] <ChronicleX> k1l_: BluesKaj  : thanks .  but guys i know that .  but there was a shortcut to restart graphical system when it freezes
[16:35] <Nilton> #linux
[16:35] <k1l_> BluesKaj: startx is not recommended. starting the dm is
[16:35] <BluesKaj> k1l_, by you perhaps , never had a problem with startx
[16:35] <mikul> ActionParsnip, why would it be different?
[16:35] <jofwolves> so i'm trying to run ubuntu 12.04 through parallels on OS X 6.8 and i can't seem to change or delete the default keyring password
[16:36] <ActionParsnip> K1l_: dm is optional though :)
[16:36] <jofwolves> any ideas?
[16:36] <k1l_> ChronicleX: oh ok. you said start not restart. its alt+print+k
[16:36] <Nilton> #linuxbr
[16:36] <ichat> btw is there a  way to add a  sinonym   to  the dash screen   when i type  com  or  cmd   it would open up a terminal...
[16:36] <ichat> when using windows at work,  im to mutch ussed to call it a command  window rather than a terminal...
[16:37] <angs> netstat -rn outputs two inf about eth0 netstat -rn how can I remove the info about 169.* ?
[16:37] <k1l_> BluesKaj: ActionParsnip starting x as root with startx may break some data rights. starting the dm is the safe way

[17:08] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: if you delete the jeyring, you can make a new one and set a blank password
[17:09] <angs> escott: how can I check it?
[17:09] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: you can set the password in the 'password' app in dash
[17:09] <jofwolves> i've deleted it (or so it seems) but it still prompts me for one whenever i try to access the root or change settings or anything like that
[17:10] <mnewton> hey guys - how do i make the terminal show how many updates I have when i open a terminal, like login terminal
[17:10] <escott> angs, what have you changed in your networking setup in the past
[17:10] <DualMoon> is it possible to get byobu to show two status lines instead of one like it used to? things are too cramped on one line.
[17:10] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: you can probably install steam on crunchbang
[17:10] <mnewton> and what's the default update-manager deamon command?
[17:10] <Tuxmascot> I tried.
[17:10] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, before deleting it i did try to change it there, but it wanted me to enter the old one in order to set a now one
[17:10] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: I see
[17:11] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: do you not have the current pass?
[17:11] <jofwolves> nope
[17:11] <angs> escott: I just added eth0 settings on  /etc/network/interfaces http://pastebin.com/Q6s7kJ57  do I need to add anything else there?
[17:11] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: then deleting is the way to go
[17:11] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, it seems to've set one by default when i first ran ubuntu
[17:12] <jofwolves> and deleting it didn't change anything as far as i can tell
[17:12] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: that doesn't happen
[17:12] <jofwolves> hence my confusion
[17:12] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: when you first use the keyring, you are asked to set a keyring password
[17:12] <jofwolves> nope
[17:13] <angs> what is the command to remove network manager?
[17:13] <escott> angs, perhaps that syntax is incorrect and bringing up the network is causing that file to be misread/misparsed and then breaking lo
[17:13] <eutheria> hello, i want to test my laptop, what can generate me some fake load
[17:13] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, i've removed and re-installed ubuntu twice now with the assumption that i was just missing something, but nowhere does it prompt me to set one
[17:13] <eutheria> just spin the cpus some work
[17:13] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: its been that way in ubuntu since 2007 when I started using ubuntu. So someone set it for you
[17:14] <angs> escott: do you think I can do anything about it?
[17:14] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: if you have a separate /home partition then the gnome key will stand
[17:14] <escott> angs, i dont know the syntax of that file so i cant say if it is wrong or not
[17:15] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, i don't know the gnome key, that's the issue
[17:15] <jofwolves> all i have, and all i was ever prompted to create, is my user (Parallels, by default) password
[17:15] <jorn> heyho, i have a shared folder on a mac without any login need (access from everyone). i want to access that from ubuntu in nautilus but it asks me for username and pw which i don't have… is there any way to access the "guest" mount option from within nautilus?
[17:15] <angs> escott: do you mean /etc/network/interfaces? how can I see the syntax?
[17:15] <Tuxmascot> ActionParsnip: Should md5sum be taking this long?
[17:16] <escott> angs, man interfaces
[17:16] <ryan27968> #linux
[17:16] <escott> Tuxmascot, if all you typed was "md5sum" it is waiting for you to input data to checksum
[17:16] <Tuxmascot> nvm
[17:16] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: can you type commands in the prompt you used?
[17:16] <Tuxmascot> It got it
[17:16] <escott> Tuxmascot, probably not what you want. you would want "md5sum filename"
[17:16] <Tuxmascot> I got the sum

[17:17] <designbybeck_> So this Java scare going around  right now.... do we need to be concerned? http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/US-Government-Department-of-Homeland-Security-Tells-Computer-Users-to-Disable-Java-186580121.html
[17:17] <Tuxmascot> ActionParsnip: They are exactly the same.
[17:17] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: do you mean sudo?
[17:17] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: good, please do that in future
[17:17] <jorn> escott: i've seen those before… they don't answer my question
[17:18] <designbybeck_> Or is the "Disable Java" only if you have Sun Java 7?
[17:18] <Tuxmascot> So, why won't it boot?
[17:18] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, yes
[17:18] <escott> jorn, im not sure what your question is
[17:19] <designbybeck_> ActionParsnip:  have you heard of people say to Disable Java because of a security risk?
[17:19] <jorn> how to access a windows share which does not require any login from nautilus which asks me for username and password
[17:19] <sirblade> hi, what is the name of the ubuntu  package that has php5 + apache2?
[17:19] <designbybeck_> does that mean on Linux as well?
[17:19] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: sudo will always ask for password unless you are in the grace period. That us normal
[17:19] <Tuxmascot> sirblade: apt-get Apache2
[17:19] <ActionParsnip> Designbybeck_: no idea. I don't use Java
[17:20] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, all other things that would generally require a password still ask for it too, though
[17:20] <jofwolves> root access, changing account onformation, etc
[17:20] <escott> jorn, are you sure it doesn't require login? sounds like smbclient is getting a username/password request
[17:20] <designbybeck_> ActionParsnip:  Guess you're in the clear then ;)
[17:20] <designbybeck_> I'll keep reading up on this exploit
[17:21] <sirblade> how do i get php to work with apache?
[17:21] <jorn> escott: well, it works from another mac… just sees the thingy, no login question at all (and it obviously doesn't have the username and pw stored anything)
[17:21] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: you can run: sudo -i    and you will not be asked for authentication for sudo stuff. You don't need to log in as root ever
[17:22] <ActionParsnip> Designbybeck: i'd ssk in #java
[17:22] <Tuxmascot> sirblade: Google configuring php5 on apache2
[17:22] <angs> I am using ubuntu 12.10: I typed sudo apt-get purge network-manager-gnome; sudo apt-get autoremove however my connection did not break. doesn't that command suppose to remove network manager?
[17:22] <jorn> escott: ah, it's username: guest, pw: empty
[17:22] <sirblade> isnt there a package i can install that does it all in one step
[17:22] <jorn> that took me ages

[17:23] <angs> thank you ActionParsnip
[17:23] <sirblade> tx
[17:23] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: what OS did you make the USB in?
[17:24] <jofwolves> and regardless, ActionParsnip, there's not much sudo stuff that i really want to be doing, my main issue is that i have no idea what the keyring password is and can't figure out how to successfully delete or change it
[17:24] <Tuxmascot> Mac OS X
[17:24] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: it will. Like I said, sudo will always ask for password.  But now it won't as you are effectively root
[17:24] <Tuxmascot> I couldn't get unetbootin to work on #!
[17:24] <sirblade> also how do you guys know the package names, i tried looking on launchpad but it's hard to navigate
[17:24] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: could try another app to make the USB
[17:25] <Tuxmascot> can't I do the command 'dd'
[17:25] <escott> !info apt-file | sirblade
[17:25] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: yes, dince oneiric, dd can be used to make bootable USBs etc
[17:25] <ubottu> sirblade: apt-file (source: apt-file): search for files within Debian packages (command-line interface). In component universe, is optional. Version 2.5.0ubuntu1 (quantal), package size 24 kB, installed size 188 kB
[17:26] <Tuxmascot> What is the syntax? dd if=X ????
[17:26] <ActionParsnip> Sirblade: or ask ubottu
[17:26] <sirblade> tx
[17:26] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: dd if=filename.iso of=/dev/whatever's
[17:26] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, it is definitely still asking me for the password in order to do anything
[17:26] <Tuxmascot> thanks
[17:27] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: even after sudo -i
[17:27] <jofwolves> yes
[17:27] <escott> jofwolves, what is asking you for the password
[17:28] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: what is the output if: cat /etc/issue
[17:28] <Tuxmascot> ActionParsnip: Do I use /dev/sdb or /dev/sdb1 ?
[17:28] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: sdb1

=== redrocket is now known as redrocket[DEN]
[17:29] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, i'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but:
[17:29] <jofwolves> Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS \n \l
[17:30] <jofwolves> is what it outputs
[17:30] <escott> jofwolves, can you take a screenshot of where it is asking for the password. you keep talking about keyrings but ActionParsnip is talking about sudo... im wondering if we are talking about the right password prompt
[17:30] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: wait, are you running sudo -i then using GUI apps and being asked for a password
[17:31] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, yes
[17:31] <jofwolves> escott, one sec
[17:31] <designbybeck_> This site mentions Linux could be infected as well with this Java exploit, just not sure if that only is related to Sun's Java 7 or not... if you have that install or the OpenJDK? http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2010/10/28/cross-platform-worm-targets-facebook-users/
[17:31] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: sudo -i only authenticates that prompt,  not the GUI
[17:32] <escott> designbybeck_, the best thing you can do is find the original CVE and see what versions of java are affected
[17:32] <escott> designbybeck_, you can also check if ubuntu has issued an update for that particular CVE
[17:32] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, that would make sense then. in that case, it's not of that much use for what i'm trying to do, which is figure out the default keyring that it's given me
[17:32] <designbybeck_> escott:  what is the CVE?
[17:32] <Tuxmascot> ActionParsnip: It finished. What do I do now? Try to boot from it?
[17:33] <escott> designbybeck_, http://cve.mitre.org/ Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
[17:33] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: there isn't a default keyring password,  it would be a massive security hole
[17:33] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot yes
[17:33] <designbybeck_> ok thank you escott looking now
[17:33] <escott> designbybeck_, reporters who know what they are doing will include the CVE in the article
[17:33] <Tuxmascot> ActionParsnip: Okay, thanks!
[17:33] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, there definitely is.
[17:34] <simpleton> Hi everyone, I'm a newbie to linux and I received a donated hp pavilion tx1000... the model has bga overheating problems and I would like to keep the fan always turned on, is there a simple way to do that?
[17:34] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves;: there are no default passwords in ubuntu
[17:34] <bekks> simpleton: Whats "bga"?
[17:34] <jofwolves> ActionParsnip, in that case it's something on Parallels Desktop's end
[17:34] <simonpatapon> Hi
[17:34] <jofwolves> either way, there definitely is one
[17:34] <simpleton> the nvidia graphics chip that comes in the motherboard of it
[17:34] <ActionParsnip> Jofwolves: maybe, not sure there
[17:35] <escott> simpleton, there is the fancontrol program, you may also be able to set the fan speed via /sys
[17:35] <designbybeck_> escott:  nothing so far on Ubuntu's site: http://www.ubuntu.com/usn
[17:35] <simonpatapon> anyone knows of any grooveshark plugin for any music player?
[17:36] <escott> designbybeck_, im not particularly interested in tracking down the CVE number for you. what exactly would you do if you found that CVE was not patched?
=== tux_ is now known as tuxmascot
[17:36] <simpleton> Fancontrol works on lubuntu also? I tried to install it yesterday, but one of the packages wasn't found by the synaptics

[18:27] <disharmonic> those gfx during bootup are really a waste of resources and a source of potential problems
[18:29] <SonikkuAmerica> disharmonic: In what?
[18:32] <Steven4242> how do I view what my wifi card is called from within terminal?
[18:32] <disharmonic> in general :p, i'm just ranting ;)
[18:32] <perl_> lshw should do the trick

[18:36] <Steven4242> yes I have found it and now I am about to solve the problem hopefully
[18:37] <k1l_> Steven4242: tried lspci?
[18:37] <Steven4242> k1l_: no I tried the other one lhsw
[18:37] <Guest____> I know, I've tried the whole thing. The iwconfig is blank, and pretty much everything is blank, is is with ndiswrapper and my driver's Xperia driver installed
[18:37] <Steven4242> and I got my internet working
[18:37] <Guest____> Not Xperia, xp
[18:37] <Steven4242> it's weird that I have to do this everytime I boot though
[18:37] <Steven4242> sudo modprobe -rf ath9k sudo modprobe -v ath9k nohwcrypt=1 sudo service network-manager restart
[18:37] <SonikkuAmerica> ((Xperia lol))
[18:38] <Steven4242> if I don't my internet just doesnt work
[18:38] <_helios_> Steven4242, you could make a script do that on bootup
[18:38] <Guest____> Lspci is also blank
[18:38] <Guest____> I'll try that command, Steven
[18:38] <Steven4242> _helios_: yes I will be looking into making scripts as soon as I fix this setup here.. now that I have an internet connection I can install Grub and try to fix this weird issue im having

[18:39] <_helios_> Steven4242, have you tried xubuntu?
[18:39] <Steven4242> _helios_: no I have not, what is the difference between x and normal ubuntu"
[18:39] <Steven4242> ?
[18:40] <SonikkuAmerica> Steven4242: For one thing, Xfce
[18:40] <_helios_> Steven4242, I just made the switch recently to a full xubuntu 12.1064bit install from a Ubuntu 12.1064bit and it is so much faster,  There is a little less eye candy but the performance is off the charts and I haven't had any crashes like I did in Ubuntu with Unity
[18:41] <SonikkuAmerica> In lieu of Unity
[18:41] <Steven4242> _helios_: but if I install xubuntu will I have to reinstall all my programs again?
[18:41] <yeats> Steven4242: you don't have to reinstall
[18:41] <Steven4242> oh
[18:42] <disharmonic> SonikkuAmerica, is xubuntu a community variant or officially supported?
[18:42] <_helios_> Steven4242, if you do a full install yes.

[18:42] <backbox> if virtually nobody is ever online for my ubuntu based distro, would it be bad IRC etiquette to ask my question here?
[18:42] <yeats> !derivatives | backbox
[18:42] <ubottu> backbox: There are some Ubuntu derivatives that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes. Please consult their websites for more information. Examples: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (see !mint), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), CrunchBang (support in #crunchbang), BackTrack (support in #backtrack-linux)
[18:42] <SonikkuAmerica> disharmonic: It's supported, but can't be installed with Wubi past 12.04
[18:42] <Steven4242> yeats: what does that do? or what is xfce?
[18:43] <_helios_> Steven4242, Xfce is a different desktop manager that is lighter on resources.
[18:43] <yeats> Steven4242: that will remove Gnome completely and you would be running (in effect) xubuntu
[18:43] <yeats> Steven4242: xfce is very good IMHO
[18:43] <Steven4242> even for a newbie though?
[18:43] <_helios_> Steven4242, yes
[18:43] <yeats> Steven4242: yep
[18:43] <SonikkuAmerica> Steven4242, _helios_: Lubuntu is even better on resources.
[18:44] <Steven4242> I have been using Windows since I was a child (literally) up until Windows 7 and only just switched to ubuntu so I really know nothing about it
[18:44] <yeats> Steven4242: you'll feel right at home in no time
[18:44] <Steven4242> it honestly gets frustrating at times but when it works damnit is this OS amazing
[18:44] <SonikkuAmerica> !lubuntu
[18:44] <ubottu> lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.
[18:44] <cha0s_> can anyone help me figure out the problem I am having with winff/ffmpeg and possiblly fix the issue?
[18:44] <_helios_> Steven4242, I suggest you give xubuntu a try I think that will solve allot of your problems.
[18:45] <yeats> Steven4242: and if you end up not liking it, switching back to gnome (or to lxde) is very simple
[18:45] <Steven4242> _helios_: alrighty I will google that and find out how to install it

[18:50] <cha0s_> can anyone help me figure out the problem I am having with winff/ffmpeg and possiblly fix the issue?
[18:50] <yeats> Tabis: "waiting for root device" usually means grub has been misconfigured somehow (in my experience)
[18:51] <backbox> I'm usualy okay with lesser supported distros just flying solo, just cant find documentation of the live user password, but keep getting kicked to the login screen...
[18:51] <disharmonic> SonikkuAmerica, i had a vague recollection of that.
[18:51] <yeats> dve: not sure what you mean by "failsafe mode", but if the network isn't working, you're still stuck unless you can hook up a keyboard/monitor
[18:51] <backbox> tried the basics... live, the distro name, user, passeword, etc
[18:52] <disharmonic> tried blank?
[18:52] <dve> yeats: urgh, I was afraid of that! If I added another NIC to the box would ubuntu auto configure it?
[18:52] <backbox> yeah
[18:52] <SonikkuAmerica> disharmonic: However, beginning with 12.10, Xubuntu can't be used with it, but all the other flavors will.
[18:52] <Timmy> where is the startup configuration in ubuntu 12.10??
[18:52] <yeats> dve: secondary NICs usually need some sort of manual configuration to work

[18:53] <cha0s_> can anyone help me figure out the problem I am having with winff/ffmpeg and possiblly fix the issue?

[18:55] <gaby> tell me how to check it please
[18:55] <yeats> Tabis: the hard drive enumeration in grub is different than how the OS does it, so if your root partition is in /dev/sda1 in ubuntu it would be something like "hd0,0" in grub (iirc)
[18:55] <gaby> sonikkuamerica: please tell me how to check the name of my card for you
[18:56] <SonikkuAmerica> disharmonic: Shiny objects hmm? Maybe you should try one. :-)  But a text based installer is hard to come by these days:

[18:56] <SonikkuAmerica> ...
[18:56] <Tabis> yeats, unfortunately i'm not experienced in linux/kernel booting much at all. maybe the parameters "rootwait" and "noinitrd" are relevant?
[18:56] <SonikkuAmerica> Gaby: Which flavor of Ubuntu are you using?
[18:57] <yeats> !grub1 | Tabis - maybe this will help?:
[18:57] <ubottu> Tabis - maybe this will help?:: grub 1 is the default boot manager for Ubuntu releases before 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - GRUB how-tos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto - See !grub for Karmic onwards
[18:58] <Tabis> about the partitions i'm sure they are correct, i've bound grub to the partition's UUID instead of fixed (hd0,0)
[18:58] <disharmonic> SonikkuAmerica, quite a few hardcore distros have one :p. Honestly i preferred the old alternative installer. Iirc it's actually based on Debian's
[18:58] <gaby> sonikkuamerica: iam using ubuntu 12.04 LTL
[18:58] <yeats> Tabis: okay - then maybe my theory is wrong
[18:59] <SonikkuAmerica> Gaby: Unity?
[18:59] <Tabis> ubottu: thanks, but grub is actually working fine. maybe - but not certain about it - there's an error in menu.lst

[19:14] <designbybeck_> this happened before I messed with the drivers as well
[19:14] <cha0s_> disharmonic: above
[19:14] <designbybeck_> I'm having the common problem where I install the NVIDIA drivers and then you only get a desktop. So instructions say to remove and install linux headers generic
[19:15] <designbybeck_> whcih I have done , but then on restart it wouldn't even bring up the desktop
[19:15] <designbybeck_> went to safe driver mode
[19:18] <yeats> Tabis: I was thinking generally about the need to install 10.04 with grub legacy on something where you're having to move the hard drive from one device to another just to troubleshoot - seems like a good use case for a VM

[19:20] <yeats> Tabis: without knowing what the end goal is, I would probably consider different approaches if it were me
[19:21] <tga> hey, on a system with 16GB RAM would you really make a 16GB swap partition?
[19:21] <bekks> Sure.
[19:21] <bekks> As long as you are going to use suspend2disk, you will have to have as much swap as RAM.
[19:22] <tga> this is a desktop, but hibernation is still handy
[19:22] <tga> I'm just a bit tight on space on this ssd
[19:22] <tga> when I go up to 32GB I don't see myself setting that aside for the swap

[19:22] <tga> 128G
[19:22] <tga> or rather 120G I think
[19:23] <bekks> Thats more than enough for 32g swap plus a full blown ubuntu install.

[19:24] <tga> what would be a generous amount of space for the / partition?
[19:24] <bekks> tga: A full blown ubuntu install takes about less than 16GB, so you will have enough space for your files, too.

[19:27] <bekks> ducktype: To my knowledge, every cron implementation uses the crontab.
[19:27] <jrib> ducktype: why do you want to do it this way instead of using crontab?
[19:27] <ducktype> i like simple things
[19:28] <tga> any sense in bothering with a /boot?
[19:28] <ducktype> crontab make no sense to me, no advantages only disavantages, it's a pain
[19:28] <bekks> ducktype: The crontab is more easy than reading zillion of different config files for different users.
[19:28] <bekks> ducktype: To me, it is vice versa.
[19:28] <Tabis> yeats: yay, i replaced the UUID with classic scheme (hd0,0) and removed "rootwait", now at least i get a kernel panic xD
[19:28] <ducktype> when i say simple i mean simple to use not to implement
[19:29] <yeats> Tabis: cool
[19:29] <bekks> ducktype: crontab -e is more simple than looking out for the correct filename, isnt it? :)
[19:29] <jrib> ducktype: but seems like the usage would be the same except instead of running "crontab -e" you run "editor ~/.whatever"
[19:29] <Tabis> guess what the last msg before panic is ;)
[19:29] <yeats> tga: there is an LVM option in 12.10 installation

[19:30] <tga> yeats: strange, I don't see it anywhere
[19:30] <yeats> tga: 12.10, right?
[19:30] <tga> yeats: yeah
[19:30] <vlt> tga: You can add LVM later easily.
[19:31] <tga> you can?
[19:31] <bekks> tga: Yes.
[19:31] <tga> I thought the partition had to be defined as lvm beforehand
[19:31] <ducktype> yep with the way i've proposed you can have mutiple files defining jobs (huge advantages), and a simple "vi  ~/.cron/job1.cron" is enough, no commands only files and paths
[19:31] <ducktype> much more maintenable
[19:31] <vlt> tga: You can also do this later.
[19:31] <tga> alright

[19:34] <Guest59774> ya tried that none of them install
[19:34] <jrib> ducktype: one of the other advantages to using crontab -e is that cron notices changes right away when you're done editing

[19:37] <jrib> ducktype: i'm just making you aware of things you should take into consideration if you decide to implement this idea of yours.  I don't think it is supported by default but there may be some configuration where you can add directories for cron to watch
[19:37] <bekks> idodeisuke: When you have to ask that - stick with 12.04

[19:40] <ducktype> jrib: "may be some configuration where you can add directories for cron to watch" i've searched for such conf option in cron and other alternatives, no way
[19:40] <harris> can you help me fix it bekks
[19:40] <jrib> ducktype: ok
[19:40] <bekks> harris: I have no clue where it comes from.
[19:40] <idodeisuke> bekks, why so?
[19:41] <ducktype> not so strange, in the linux ecosystem, once implemented no one look ever back
[19:41] <bekks> idodeisuke: Why what?
[19:41] <vlt> idodeisuke: I don't think so. As long as 12.04 is not EOL.
[19:41] <bekks> idodeisuke: 12.04 will be supported until 2017.
[19:41] <ducktype> only kernel devs, user mode linux devs reiterate the same design decision only because is traditional, blah

[20:54] <jrib> wookey: yeah your two friends at this point will be "apt-get dist-upgrade" and "dpkg --configure -a".  But I'd try to figure out what went wrong from the logs before deciding on a course of action
[20:55] <wookey> indeed. that pointer to dist-upgrade looks intersting :-)
[20:55] <wookey> what do ubuntu-server people do if upgrades can only be done graphically?
[20:56] <jrib> wookey: do-release-upgrade is a non-graphical way to upgrade
[20:56] <jrib> wookey: I suppose you could try that too.
[20:56] <wookey> aha. useful
[20:56] <boot_problems> Anyone have any experience using newer gigabyte motherboards? i can not dual boot alongside windows
[20:56] <Forty-3> I fucked up my dns
[20:56] <Forty-3> how can I fix it?
[20:56] <jrib> wookey: you should be careful now though because if your upgrade was from 11.10 and now you are on a broken 12.04, you probably don't want the tool to try to upgrade 12.04 to 12.10
[20:57] <Forty-3> this is on ubuntu lts
[20:57] <Forty-3> I get "cannot resolve hostname" from all sityes
[20:58] <wookey> the dist upgrade log says DEBUG found components: {'precise': set(['restricted', 'main', 'multiverse',
[20:58] <boot_problems> i have made a live usb install. it installed, i dont get a grub option or anything different. easy bcd recognized it and still couldnt get it to boot
[20:58] <wookey> DEBUG abort called
[20:58] <wookey> is that a clue?
[21:00] <rhagu> hi, I installed mediatomb on my ubuntu 12.04 server but it starts before the NICs are brought up and therefore wont start. What can i do now?
[21:00] <wookey> The apt.log in 20130102-1652 (day of failed upgrade) says "Log time: 2012-10-15 15:34:53.397186 " which seems odd.
[21:01] <tga> hey, what am I missing out by running x86 on a i5/16G RAM?
[21:01] <wookey> Ah I see each log contains info from state of previous upgrade. fair enough
[21:01] <tga> I see x86 can access all the RAM now, anything major that x64 would do for me?
[21:02] <wookey> tga: go faster doing some things. Use more memory doing everything

[21:03] <Sgeo> Is there a viable path for upgrading from Kubuntu 10.10 to a modern version?

[21:04] <Sgeo> Got that error when trying to go to Natty'
[21:04] <tga> wookey: some stuff like vmware player don't seem to like x64 too much, so I'm thinking about just staying with x86
[21:04] <tga> I am using disk encryption so I guess that could be faster
[21:05] <wookey> vmware player is fine on amd64 for me (except every distro upgrade it needs new modules and usually fails to make them itself)
[21:05] <tga> that's good to know
[21:05] <tga> any good reason you're running x64?
[21:05] <wookey> I've bee nusing amd64 for ~7 years now on most of my boxes
[21:06] <wookey> because they are x86_64 machines - it just seemed natural
[21:06] <tga> well, yeah, I understand support has gotten better
[21:06] <wookey> I only discovered a few months ago that there is a memory penalty

[21:06] <wookey> I avoid proprietary flash and java
[21:06] <tga> yeah, well
[21:06] <tga> I'd rather have the option to run them
[21:07] <wookey> they do run. I just don't unless I have to
[21:07] <tga> so again, x86 or x64?
[21:07] <wookey> So no extensive experience.
[21:08] <disharmonic> tga, with x86 no single app can use more 2GB of ram iirc(
[21:09] <wookey> hmm, this machine is full of essential packages that are broken (perl, upstart, module-init-tools, plymouth, libnih). That'll be the problem.
[21:09] <tga> disharmonic: that makes it easy, I'm mostly in virtual machines
[21:10] <tga> oh well, that's a reinstall for me
[21:11] <Sgeo> Is https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades/ out of date itself?
[21:11]  * Sgeo facepalms
[21:11] <wookey> looks like libc6 is still 2.13 so sysv-rc and grub-pc failed to upgrade

[21:18] <ubottu> jnix try that for a start: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto
[21:18] <jnix> tried that, the driver segfaults, but i had been using 12.10
[21:18] <jnix> i just installed 12.04, going to see if that helps at all :)
[21:19] <SonikkuAmerica> OK, Gaby and I were discussing an issue involving the broadcom wireless card in her laptop...
[21:20] <adamk> jnix: If the hybrid GPU is supported with the catalyst driver, it will just work after installing the driver and creating an xorg.conf file with 'aticonfig --initial'.  If it doesn't work, it's not supported.  Alternatively, you can check the BIOS to see if you can disable either the intel or AMD GPU.
[21:20] <SonikkuAmerica> We can't get it to work, and she has no ethernet
[21:20] <SonikkuAmerica> For the problem machine that is
[21:20] <jnix> adamk, it works with the catalyst driver under fedora/rhel, trying to familiarize myself with ubuntu.. hope it'll work this time
[21:21] <jnix> didn't have problems building it on rhel but it's using an older version of X and the proprietary driver loaded perfectly, but it's RHEL so they generally do work >.<
[21:21] <SonikkuAmerica> We tried everything, from the jockey-gtk to the manual .deb file installaition.
[21:22] <jnix> xubuntu rocks my socks and i refuse to go back haha
[21:23] <jnix> so the video driver guide references /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d which doesn't exist on my 12.04 system, this should still work though right?

[21:32] <invariant> Why does Ubuntu distribute broken versions of software when good versions also exist?
[21:32] <yeats> invariant: can you elaborate?
[21:32] <invariant> yeats, cdrecords as distributed with Ubuntu 12.04 does not function.

[21:33] <invariant> yeats, the upstream version functions perfectly.
[21:33] <invariant> yeats, it has already been reported, but completely ignored.
[21:33] <TheLordOfTime> invariant, link to the bug thenm
[21:33] <invariant> yeats, 20 people have said that the upstream version works.
[21:33] <TheLordOfTime> invariant, link to the ubuntu bug please.
[21:33] <adamk> cha0s_: As I'm not an ffmpeg expert, I have no idea what that option even does, so I can't say if it will or won't convert the file.  But a quick search through the ffmpeg man page shows that -q isn't a valid optiobn.
[21:33] <yeats> invariant: bugs happen - not much to do other than report them
[21:34] <invariant> yeats, this is systematic.
[21:34] <invariant> yeats, I am sure that to some people this is a well known issue.
[21:34] <cha0s_> DerHeks: where am i missing a "D"
[21:34] <invariant> There must be some politics involved.
[21:34] <invariant> Or some stepping on genitals.
[21:35] <TheLordOfTime> invariant, if you have the ubuntu bug number or link please give it to me, if a package is in universe, then its up to the community or upstream to release a fix to Ubuntu (or preferably Debian) to get it fixed, and then the cherry-picked code changes get applied to earlier releases
[21:35] <cha0s_> adamk: ok well I shall try it without the -q:v command and see if anything works
[21:35] <invariant> The author of cdrecord also says that Ubuntu is distributing a broken version.

[22:11] <FireBeard> I asked a question
[22:11] <schultza> lovely.. wine is invite only!?
[22:11] <Eagleman> just wait then :P, nobody knows the answer
[22:12] <FireBeard> I'm sure people know
[22:12] <FireBeard> I used to be a regular here, years ago
[22:12] <schultza> i just joined this channel, firebeard.. what was your question.
[22:12] <Eagleman> looks more like an hardware issue to me
[22:12] <FireBeard> actually, I've heard more people talking about this
[22:13] <schultza> !winetrick
[22:13] <schultza> !winetricks
[22:13] <k1l> FireBeard: is it a bluetooth mouse? does that mouse have a batterysaving standby?
[22:14] <FireBeard> my question is: why do I have to phisically BANG my Logitech laser mouse to make it active and work again after a few mins?
[22:14] <schultza> if anyone is in the #wine (wine is not an emulator) channel, can i please have an invite? if not? why is it invite only lately?
[22:14] <FireBeard> I've had to do this with several mice
[22:14] <schultza> FireBeard: you shouldnt have to "bang" any hardware to get it to work
[22:14] <DJones> schultza: If you were looking for the wine channel, its #winehq it may be that only registered users can access it though
[22:14] <Eagleman> schultza are you logged in on irc?
=== Luke23ae__ is now known as Luke23ae
[22:14] <k1l> FireBeard: ok, i count it as a hardware mailfunction

[22:15] <FireBeard> so it's not new to me
[22:15] <schultza> re: #wine - YOU (schultza) have been booted from #wine by ChanServ (Invite only channel)
[22:16] <DJones> schultza: As I said earlier, the wine channel is #winehq
[22:16] <FireBeard> and yes, I have to PHYSICALLY bang my mouse in order to make it work again [10.04]
[22:16] <schultza> DJones: thanks
[22:16] <FireBeard> same goes for THREE mice I've tried
[22:16] <FireBeard> so, what's up?
[22:16] <hiccup> !ask where can I learn more about installing linux with windows 8?
[22:16] <ubottu> hiccup: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[22:17] <schultza> firebeard: does it work with another OS or computer without the physical altercations?
[22:17] <DJones> !uefi | hiccup
[22:17] <ubottu> hiccup: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[22:17] <escott> hiccup, what exactly is your question?
[22:17] <FireBeard> schmidtm: I don't know
[22:17] <FireBeard> I only use linux
[22:17] <FireBeard> I don't have Windows to test with
[22:17] <hiccup> I've not installed linux since pre-uefi, so there's plenty I don't understand. Just wanting a guide, I guess.
[22:18] <escott> hiccup, rodsbooks.com does a good job describing gpt partitioning
[22:18] <addicat> Hello, Does anyone have several minutes to help me mount an ubuntu-server NFS share from OS X 10.8? I'm pretty far along in the process and got stuck when google stopped offering help. I can view the export from my client terminal with show mount -e ser.ver.i.p. Thanks!
[22:18] <addicat> My server's hosts files are set up to enable all connections (until I get it working)
[22:19] <hiccup> hey, thanks =)
[22:20] <schultza> FireBeard: are the mice you are using wireless?
[22:21] <FireBeard> yes
[22:21] <escott> hiccup, numerous commentators have addressed the secureboot stuff
[22:21] <schultza> as i know, wireless mice tend to hibernate when not in use and have to wake up by use before they start sending data to the OS... i have one that does that
[22:21] <Eagleman> Thanks for the suggestion FireBeard,, i got it working now
[22:22] <FireBeard> schultza: I know that, but why do I have to actually BANG them to wake up again?
[22:22] <Eagleman> How do i allow the user jrpoot to login on jrpoot@jrpoot.eu and deny login on jrpoot@eagleman.net in postfix ?
[22:23] <FireBeard> I've tried three mice, and all three need the bang to wake up again..
[22:23] <FireBeard> I smash them on my leg to make them wake up
[22:23] <schultza> that's is ridiculous to need to bang them. Eagleman may be right. it may just be a hardware issue.
[22:24] <FireBeard> I'm not lying...
[22:24] <FireBeard> I actually have to do that
[22:24] <FireBeard> :0
[22:24] <schultza> im not saying you are... right now. i dont know what the problem is why they need that blunt force trauma to wake up
[22:24] <hiccup> man, if you have cats, i feel for them
[22:24] <Eagleman> lol
[22:25] <schultza> hiccup: what was just horrible.
[22:25] <FireBeard> it's like one of those bouncy balls with lights in them, and when you bounce them hard enough, the ligts start working
[22:25] <schultza> s/what/that
[22:25] <hiccup> well they get all nice and comfortable and take naps like cats do
[22:25] <schultza> lol
[22:25] <hiccup> and then the mice fall asleep and require percussive maintenance
[22:25] <FireBeard> I really am not lying...
[22:26] <schultza> we are NOT saying your are lying..
[22:26] <FireBeard> it's implied ;)
[22:26] <hiccup> I believe you- weird hardware issues suck
[22:26] <schultza> my grammer is horrible today.. ill go back to bed.
[22:26] <FireBeard> nah, I'm just saying it is how it is :D
[22:26] <FireBeard> gheh
[22:26] <FireBeard> with 3 different mice...
[22:26] <FireBeard> it's amazing
[22:26] <Eagleman> all logitech you said?
[22:26] <FireBeard> yes
[22:27] <schultza> well, i guess im staying away from logitech mice for awhile longer
[22:27] <Eagleman> Why not buy another brand, would be the easiest solution
[22:27] <escott> FireBeard, have you tried just pressing a button to see if that wakes it up?
[22:27] <FireBeard> I actually LOVE Logitech, becsuse the hardware ALWAYS works
[22:27] <FireBeard> escott: yes
[22:27] <schultza> in this case.. it has to be forcefully coerced to work beautifully
[22:27] <FireBeard> I've pressed every button available
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[22:28] <schultza> pun intended
[22:28] <FireBeard> and then moving it
[22:28] <FireBeard> gheh
[22:28] <FireBeard> it\'s the strangest thing
[22:28] <disharmonic> The actual lesson is "stay away from wireless mice" :p
[22:28] <schultza> good point
[22:28] <FireBeard> I hate wirefull mice
[22:28] <FireBeard> so I'll keep using wireless
[22:28] <schultza> wireless anything gets lost too often, especially with cats
[22:29] <FireBeard> no no, it's VERY consistent
[22:29] <FireBeard> once banged, it's awake
[22:29] <FireBeard> for hours on end
[22:29] <DJones> FireBeard: Don't know if this helps http://askubuntu.com/questions/161657/wireless-mouse-temporarily-freezes-sleeps-on-battery-power
[22:29] <FireBeard> it's just when I haven't used it for a couple of hours that it needs a bang
[22:29] <schultza> ah, something i didnt know
[22:30] <schultza> the wireless mouse i have actually has a switch on the bottom to turn it off/on (separate of the sync). that mouse has been more consistent when i need it
[22:30] <FireBeard> my pc's do NOT go into sleep mode
[22:30] <schultza> however that wireless mouse does.
[22:31] <FireBeard> schmidtm: mine does aswell
[22:31] <disharmonic> your mouse does though
[22:31] <computer> Hi. Simple question = Is it possible to enable Unity 2d on most recent version of Ubuntu Studio?
[22:31] <FireBeard> but why shut it off when it does that all by itself?
[22:31] <bobweaver> computer not a simple question but what is lastest Ubuntu studio ?
[22:31] <schultza> it's a nicer wake up option than your leg :)
[22:32] <bobweaver> Like whta is it based off 12.04 ect
[22:32] <FireBeard> I still have to bang it
[22:32] <computer> 12.04.1 LTS
[22:32] <sheep_> hi, I deleted a large number of packages from my netbook (I switched to xubuntu) and now x complains about low graphics mode on startup, however if I log in at the console and startx it works, any ideas?
[22:32] <schultza> even with the switch?
[22:32] <disharmonic> 12.04 has Unity 2D yes
[22:32] <FireBeard> I ACTUALLY have to bang the mouse on something, to make it wake up
[22:32] <bobweaver> computer,  then yes you can if it is 12,04
[22:32] <bobweaver> computer,  what are you doing with unity 2d ?
[22:32] <computer> Not in Log on menu? Tried install but nothing?
[22:33] <disharmonic> FireBeard, does the mouse have a usb transmitter?
[22:33] <hiccup> man, you can't be the only one with that issue- have you submitted something to logitech?
[22:33] <FireBeard> disharmonic: yes, it's a wireless USB mouse by Logitech
[22:33] <bobweaver> computer,  what does        apt-cache policy unity-2d-shell          say ?
[22:33] <disharmonic> So have you tried removing the stick and reinserting it?
[22:34] <bobweaver> or computer  what happens when you type into the terminal     unity-2d-shell
[22:34] <FireBeard> disharmonic: that's the same amount of action I have to do to wake up the mouse
[22:34] <computer>  Installed: 5.12.0-0ubuntu1.2

[22:34] <k1l> FireBeard: like i told you. they have a standby that needs some time to wake up
[22:34] <FireBeard> if not even more...
[22:35] <FireBeard> true, but why do they need an actual bang
[22:35] <marcusbaird> hey guys aubuntu phone os interview  with twil and johnobacon
[22:35] <marcusbaird> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu98c6EzEhI
[22:35] <FireBeard> that is my question
[22:35] <disharmonic> FireBeard, yes but it's physically less damaging to the mouse
[22:35] <k1l> FireBeard: you need to ask that logitech
[22:35] <bobweaver> good computer  now if you type in    unity-2s-shell  does it start ?
[22:35] <k1l> FireBeard: its not an ubuntu issue
[22:35] <FireBeard> I never had this with Windows
[22:36] <schultza> why not rapidly moving the mouse about (no bang) for a few more seconds and wait for it to wake up?
[22:36] <bobweaver> unity2d-shell  that is computer not unity-2s-shell lol
[22:36] <FireBeard> and I didn't install Logitech software on my linux machines
[22:36] <schultza> if there is some gyro detect for use, more rapidly moving may jar it awake than the bang
[22:36] <machicola> what command line tools/programs can I use to manage network connections? i know there seem to be many to observe the network and network status but are there any to set default connections/network keys... manually connect or disconnect, etc.
[22:36] <disharmonic> There's no linux version of logitech software that i'm aware of
[22:36] <bobweaver> computer,  if it launchs look at xsession if you do not know what them files are remove it and re-install it
[22:37] <bekks> machicola: NetworkManager is available as CLI too.
[22:37] <FireBeard> schultza: I can unsterstand that, but the mice I have must be too old to have those sensors...
[22:37] <escott> machicola, nmcli to use existing connections created by NM
[22:37] <FireBeard> especially at those prices...
[22:37] <Tropetre> Hi all!
[22:38] <machicola> bekks, escott : ok, thankyou, will look into these
[22:38] <FireBeard> 'lo
[22:38] <k1l> FireBeard: again, talk to logitech first
[22:38] <FireBeard> I did
[22:38] <FireBeard> they have no idea
[22:38] <Tropetre> Quick question: Where is the MD5 for Ubuntu 12.10 :)
[22:39] <bobweaver> !md5sum
[22:39] <ubottu> To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[22:39] <FireBeard> on the website
[22:39] <FireBeard> ;)
[22:39] <escott> !hashes
[22:39] <ubottu> See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes for the md5sums of all downloadable Ubuntu releases
[22:39] <schultza> he's asking about using it in linux
[22:39] <escott> Tropetre, ^
[22:39] <FireBeard> yay for the bot :D
[22:39] <Tropetre> tRIED TO FIND IT BUT DIDN'T SEE IT ANYWHERE, tHANKS!
[22:39] <ProfessorDavis> hello all, i'm hoping someone can answer this question. Is there a terminal command that will remove the recent documents list from the dash?
[22:39] <Tropetre> Caps, sorry!
[22:39] <Eagleman> reverse capslocking
[22:39] <FireBeard> no problem
[22:39] <escott> ProfesorBacon, i believe it is a file in ~/.config
[22:40] <computer> ok where is xsession? Not sure what to do with paste bin?
[22:40] <FireBeard> ProfesorBacon: is here too?
[22:40] <FireBeard> oh god
[22:40] <schultza> Tropetre: md5sum is the program you are looking for
[22:40] <Ziber> Using command line arguments, I want to parse out free/used/total RAM. How can I get the second item (separated by spaces) in output?
[22:41] <FireBeard> you can always check it via your terminal :)
[22:41] <bekks> Ziber: ... | awk '{ print $2; }'
[22:41] <ProfessorDavis> any idea where it be under .config escott?
[22:41] <schultza> paste bin is a website log site that will give us a url to look at rather than read multiple lines in the irc channel
[22:41] <Ziber> awk, thanks
[22:41] <disharmonic> FireBeard,  a quick google shows some people having similar issues on Windows
[22:42] <FireBeard> disharmonic: my mouse thing?
[22:42] <schultza> ziber, have you looked into xargs?
[22:42] <FireBeard> :?
[22:42] <bobweaver> computer,  if you do not know much about messing around with xsessions files I say do not mess with it. Just re-install unity 2d and see if that works
[22:42] <FireBeard> I've searched a lot, and got tired
[22:42] <disharmonic> It pains me to admit it, but MS makes the most reliable peripherals
[22:42] <FireBeard> actually., no
[22:42] <disharmonic> Yes, no solutions that i saw though
[22:43] <FireBeard> it's just that Ubu does not make peripherals at all
[22:43] <schultza> disharmonic: including gamer mice?
[22:43] <FireBeard> so
=== linuxthefish is now known as linuxthefish`
[22:43] <computer> Yes but pastebin asking me to log in :( What's the best command to install unity 2d again?
[22:43] <FireBeard> we're at least a decade behind
[22:44] <disharmonic> schultza, hard to say. Haven't tried any of their gamer mice.
[22:44] <DJones> FireBeard: http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=643
[22:44] <bobweaver> computer,  sudo apt-get --purge remove unity-2d && sudo apt-get install unity-2d
[22:44] <FireBeard> DJones: ok
[22:44] <disharmonic> computer, use paste.ubuntu.com
[22:44] <sheep_> hi, I deleted a large number of packages from my netbook (I switched to xubuntu-desktop) and now x complains about low graphics mode on startup, however if I log in at the console and startx it works, any ideas? (12.10)
[22:44] <bobweaver> computer,  I have a altered Unity 2d if you would like to try it
[22:44] <hiccup> curious, it is branded with the ubuntu logo, but who makes it?
[22:44] <hiccup> am i missing something?
[22:44] <FireBeard> that's probably made by a hardware company that knows what it does
[22:44] <dr_willis> removeing/reinstalling unity-2d will not reset the users settings
[22:45] <FireBeard> and not by Canonical that does not
[22:45] <bobweaver> dr_willis,  in unity 2d xsession ?
[22:45] <computer> I can work most things out but finding the right info is a '%&*$£%$........Thanks I'll try that.
[22:45] <FireBeard> not even a guess
[22:45] <SonikkuAmerica> Bob Weaver, computer : also [ sudo apt-get install --reinstall unity-2d ]
[22:45] <dr_willis> bobweaver:  the apt package system does not every touch stuff in the users home.
[22:45] <k1l> FireBeard: can we take your hardware issue into the offtopic channel? thank you
[22:45] <bobweaver> dr_willis, xsessions are under /usr
[22:46] <FireBeard> we're talking about the link posted, now
[22:46] <Tropetre> It matched! (MD5SUM) Thank you! Now I just have to figure out why my installation where so odd.. Is there any common reason the GUI doesn't appear but cursor and background is visible and when I installed it there was an error with icons, they only showed up after I dragged the windows off screen for a sec.
=== linuxthefish` is now known as linuxthefish
[22:46] <FireBeard> not my issue
[22:46] <dr_willis> bobweaver:  and thats not in the USERS home..
[22:46] <FireBeard> although my issue is very much ontopic
[22:46]  * bobweaver is lost on that one I mean I have a deep root in unity2d and that makes no sense to me at all 
[22:47] <bobweaver> Unity 2d has nothing at all to do with users $HOME
[22:47] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  common reason unity/compiz dosent like your video card/drivers 3d stuff. so it fails to load completely
[22:47] <dr_willis> bobweaver:  the users $home has settings for unity wich often cause issues
[22:47] <bobweaver> Unity 2d does not use compiz
[22:47] <FireBeard> k1l we can take it outside, if that's what you want...
[22:48] <dr_willis> I never said it did.
[22:48] <Tropetre> dr_willis: So... do I just install a new GUI or what do I do? :S
[22:48] <iLogical> can i use system encryption with the alternate cd?
[22:48] <FireBeard> may I just say that your nick is next to useless to autocomplete?
[22:48] <jord333> hi
[22:48] <bobweaver> I have made my own unity 2d many many times I am lost here
[22:48] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  or double check your video card drivers are working properly./ I always have backup guis to use.
[22:48] <jord333> I think ubuntu website is down http://team.ubuntu.ru/   is not loading
[22:48] <iLogical> (it's the one which reads uefi partitions)

[22:49] <k1l> jord333: its loading here
[22:49] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  common test for any problems is to make a new user - see if the problem still happens to them.
[22:49] <mgodzilla> installed eeebuntu 2.0 - but not more lts for juanty
[22:49] <mgodzilla> anyone ever updated one of these to 10.04?
[22:49] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  if the styff works with a new user - that points to a  setting issue in the problem users home.
[22:49] <donttrustem> Just tried to install 12.4 lts on my acer aspire one and I get a black screen on boot up and nothing else
[22:49] <bodhi1> hi
[22:49] <jord333> ok thanks k1l it's just me then
[22:50] <dr_willis> mgodzilla:  upgrading a non-ubuntu supported variant to a ubuntu  is not a good idea
[22:50] <Tropetre> dr_willis: How would I do that if I'm in terminal? Can't get to any menus :P
[22:50] <iLogical> which mirror can I use for therse extra dot something?
[22:50] <FireBeard> http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=643 who would ANYTHING LIKE THAT use that as an everyday mouse?
[22:50] <iLogical> I didn't find any which worked
[22:50] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  by using the rm command or mv to move the various config files/dirs
[22:50] <donttrustem> How do I reinstall ubuntu
[22:50] <mgodzilla> ok.  thx.
[22:50] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  if you want to move/remove settings.
[22:50] <MDKwlan> Tropetre, ctrl+alt+t open term
[22:50] <computer> Ok. Re-installed Unity 2D.....Is that all....Just log out...Choose 2D and log in yes?
[22:50] <FireBeard> that thing is completely useless
[22:50] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  adding a new user -->  sudo adduser billgates
[22:51] <bobweaver> yes computer
[22:51] <IdleOne> FireBeard: Do you have a support question that is Ubuntu related?
[22:51] <Tropetre> dr_willis: Wouldn't that cause problems with access to files?
[22:51] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  its a test... its only a test.
[22:51] <computer> Ok will try.......Thanks :)
[22:51] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  if a new user works - that shows its a setting issue.

[22:56] <Slart> donttrustem: you could try the live cd for the newest version ie 12.10
[22:56] <Slart> donttrustem: live cd = install cd
[22:56] <davidokner> I'm getting graphical glitches with Ubuntu 3d
[22:56] <kelvinella> Hi
[22:56] <Slart> donttrustem: or you could try some of the more common workarounds like noapic, noapci etc
[22:56] <computer> Ok. Tried that but no Unity 2D Session on drop down list at log in????????
[22:56] <donttrustem> Start how do I reinstall
[22:57] <bobweaver> computer,  what does that flavor use lightdm ?
[22:57] <dr_willis> donttrustem:  Normal Ubuntu/Unity works on my 2 netbooks fine.
[22:57] <Slart> donttrustem: the same way you installed it in the first place, I would assume
[22:57] <MDKwlan> reinstall ubuntu? donttrustem?
[22:57] <bobweaver> computer,  I mean does Ubuntu Studio use lightdm or gdm ?
[22:57] <computer> Terminal code to find out?
[22:58] <donttrustem> dr_willis: I am trying the install again
[22:58] <donttrustem> 12.04
[22:58] <Tropetre> dr_willis: It's the card :( I presume. *Sigh* This is usually a pain! Thanks for the help anyways! :)
[22:58] <kelvinella> davidokner: which netbook?
[22:58] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  whats your video card?
[22:58] <bobweaver> computer,  install Lightdm     sudo apt-get install lightdm    and when you get to the blue screen that asks if you want to use lightdm or gdm   make the choice of light dm then reboot
[22:59] <donttrustem> It seems to install fine but when it boots I get the purple screen then a black screen ...  That it
[22:59] <ProfessorDavis> Hello, another quick question
[22:59] <davidokner> kelvinella: I'm running on a high end iMac with parallels.
[22:59] <dr_willis> !nomodeset | donttrustem
[22:59] <ubottu> donttrustem: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[22:59] <computer> Ok
[22:59] <rimas> is there a way to cap cpu usage of a process? it has priority 'very low', but still uses too much cpu when other programs do not need it. I'd like to make it "priority: very low; max cpu: 30%"
[22:59] <Tropetre> dr_willis: Geforce Ti 4400
[22:59] <xbskid> Is software-center.ubuntu.com undergoing maintenance or something? I'm trying to redeem coupons from the latest Humble Bundle and I keep getting 500/Server errors
[23:00] <kelvinella> Oh because my brothers Dell mini 10 does have issue with ubuntu 12.04
[23:00] <Tropetre> dr_willis: I presume that's legacy drivers?
[23:00] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  you installed the nvidia-current package to get nvidia drivers?
[23:00] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  i dont know what cards use what drivers any more
[23:00] <ProfessorDavis> is there a way to list file to a list form instead of file icons, similar to OSX?
[23:00] <computer> lightdm is already the newest version
[23:00] <kelvinella> Maybe the video card it's an intel card
[23:00] <ProfessorDavis> i can't seem to find a way to do this
[23:00] <ProfessorDavis> any help would be greatly appreciated
[23:00] <dr_willis> ProfessorDavis:  list file to a list?
[23:00] <Tropetre> dr_willis: No, I'll try to :) I understand. It's a pain in the ***!
=== linuxthefish is now known as linuxthefish`
[23:00] <dr_willis> The Nautilus file manager has a view list  option.
[23:01] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  i rarely have issues with my 4 nvidia systems.
[23:01] <ProfessorDavis> is that the default file manager?
[23:01] <dr_willis> ProfessorDavis:  yes/.
[23:01] <dr_willis> Most every file manager ive seen has a file list option
[23:01] <computer> would i have to use apt-remove first
[23:02] <Tropetre> dr_willis: How would I remove the test-account?
[23:02] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  that Addational-drivers tool should suggest the proper 3d driver for your card.  You could just install openbox to get a working desktop. then try the  addditional-drivers tool
[23:02] <ProfessorDavis> for instance if i go the go>downloads i see the files
[23:02] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  Never really noticed. ;) deluser i think
[23:02] <cakeboss> Hey all. How do I open a .ppm file in ubuntu?
[23:02] <ProfessorDavis> if i right click i want a "list"option or an icon on the window that will do that
[23:02] <ProfessorDavis> but i see neither
[23:02] <bobweaver> computer,  make sure that it is in use      sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
[23:02] <ProfessorDavis> is this something i need to setup in sys pref?
[23:03] <dr_willis> ProfessorDavis:  check the menus at the top panel. Nautiluys definatly has a show files in a list option

[23:03] <computer> sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
[23:03] <Tropetre> dr_willis: Okay! Removing user and installing openbox and then trying additional drivers! I'll be back in a couple of minutes :P
[23:03] <computer> sorry wrong box :)
[23:03] <dr_willis> Theres most likely some key-combo to have the file manager show in list mode also. but i dont rember it
[23:03] <cakeboss> I don't know why I can't open it
[23:04] <donttrustem> dr_willis: Thanks... I cannot view the whole page on my iPad :(
[23:05] <ProfessorDavis> i found it
[23:05] <ProfessorDavis> i just you have to do it from the menu
[23:05] <ProfessorDavis> it would nice if you could choose on the window, similarly to OSX
[23:05] <ProfessorDavis> thanks everyone
[23:05] <dr_willis> not everything has to be a clone of osx
[23:05] <Stephini> hey my spouse's computer has a messed up internal keyboard that randomly strikes keys, we fixxed this in windows by force loading incompatible drivers rendering it dissabled. is there an easy way to disable said keyboard in linux?
[23:06] <MDKwlan> It's ctrl+2 for listing
[23:06] <dr_willis> actually i think it used to be on that main menu. and they cleaned it out. ;)
[23:06] <computer> Ok did reconfigure lightdm....Didn't say anything.....Just new command line.....Now what?
[23:06] <dr_willis> Or you need to click in a specific open white space spot
[23:06] <MDKwlan> I'm using gnome fallback idk if its the same for unity
[23:06] <bobweaver> computer,  sudo service lightdm restart
[23:07] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to get NetworkManager to ALWAYS preserve DNS, ie not touch /etc/resolv.conf, or at least use 127.0.0.1 for all network connections? I have an android phone that I tether with and it takes the DNS from the dhcp server. even if I manually override the connection settings (going to Connection Info->IPv4 Settings -> Method -> Automatic (DHCP) Addresses Only), next time I plug in, it creates a NEW connection, ie Wired Connection
[23:07] <tomasm-> 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5, 6, etc and NEVER keeps the existing. Can network-manager have a global config file option to always use a localhost dns?
[23:10] <ProfessorDavis> dr_willis: no, but you must admit, it would be useful, as a designer sometimes i did to look at photos, and sometimes text documents, so switching on the fly is nice, regardless of what OS it is
[23:10] <dr_willis> ProfessorDavis:  they removed that item i belive.. they want a cleaner look
[23:10] <cocomo> where can i find graphic driver settings in ubuntu 12.10
[23:10] <dr_willis> ProfessorDavis:  they expect you to use hotkeys i guess..
[23:10] <Slart> tomasm-: you can set a dns to try before trying the one handed to you from dhcp.. I think it's a setting the dhcp client.. pre somthing
[23:11] <ProfessorDavis> if you use the hotkeys do you need to reboot the window?
[23:11] <MDKwlan> Are you using proprietary hardware cocomo?
[23:11] <cocomo> i am using nvidia geforce 210
[23:11] <escott> Stephini, you could remove the keyboard from the input devices with xinput
[23:11] <dr_willis> Reboot the window?
[23:11] <cocomo> i want to test other driver options
[23:12] <cocomo> because my game is crashing regularly
[23:12] <MDKwlan> Do you have the proprietary driver installed?
[23:12] <cocomo> no
[23:12] <Stephini> escott i'm guessing xinput is a CLI arg?
[23:12] <riderplus> hi. anyone familiar with midori web-browser?
[23:12] <cocomo> ubuntu installed the graphics driver by itself
[23:12] <MDKwlan> Well I'd assume that would be why your game is  crashing then.
[23:12] <computer> OK. Did "restart lightdm" and crashed....Rebooted......Still no 2D Unity at Log In screen?
[23:12] <ProfessorDavis> i had to close the window and reopen it see the display changes when i made them in the menu preferences. If i used the hotkeys would i need to do something similarly?
[23:12] <riderplus> the #midori channel seems dead
[23:13] <cocomo> so i should download drivers from nvidia website
[23:13] <cocomo> it doesn't just crashes my game but my whole computer hangs and needs to be restarted
[23:13] <MDKwlan> I use ati/amd and I just download it from the additional drivers program already installed
[23:14] <MDKwlan> but I'm not sure because nvida is better supported. I'd go with the one from their site.
[23:14] <azrael_> guten abend meint autostart scheint zu spinnen es öffnen sich immer bluefish dokument-betrachter und firefox hab xubuntu 12.10 und keine autostart einträge finden können
[23:14] <cocomo> MDKwlan: i can't find that additional drivers settings wizard on ubuntu 12.10
[23:14] <cocomo> can u guide me? am using 12.10
[23:15] <dr_willis> ProfessorDavis:  they chagne the file listing when i use the keys here.. did you even try them?
[23:15] <Slart> tomasm-: here it is.. it's called prepend and it goes into the dhclient configuration file http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1372942
[23:15] <MDKwlan> I pm'd you cocomo.
[23:15] <dr_willis> Using the .run driver from nvidias site should be the last drivers you try
[23:15] <MDKwlan> ^
[23:15] <Stephini> is there a way on 2 monitor setup to have each one have it's own selectable workspaces? my partner asked me abotu that when i was showing her how workspaces work.
[23:16] <dr_willis> cocomo:  its in the software-sources tool. in the last tab
[23:16] <xbskid> What can I use on Ubuntu 12.10 for configuring firewall rules on a per-program basis?
[23:16] <MDKwlan> If you're using unity just look for additional dirvers
[23:16] <computer> OK. Did "restart lightdm" and crashed....Rebooted......Still no 2D Unity at Log In screen?
[23:16] <dr_willis> Stephini:  its normally one WIDE monitor. it dosent really know its 2 monitors
[23:17] <Stephini> she's using mate i think atm and it knows to put her action bar on just one monitor.
[23:17] <dr_willis> Stephini:   you can pin specific apps always on top/sticky to have them stay on the 2nd monitor if you wanted to
[23:17] <dr_willis> Stephini:  no idea on Mate. its not a ubuntu supported thing.
[23:17] <bobweaver> computer,  what does apt-cache policy gdm    say ?  Please use Pastbin the bot will tell you more

[23:17] <dr_willis> Unity can have its panel on one or both monitors
[23:18] <Stephini> so the knowing what monitor to put the action bar on is a mate capacity is what i meant to ask by that...heh
[23:21] <DevNull_> I need help getting my bluetooth keyboard working for grub/typing in password for encrypted luks setup
[23:21] <pianojake> hi i'm having trouble connecting to the internet via ethernet on ubuntu. i'm a new user so how would i go about doing this?
[23:21] <computer> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1525112/             Me not need to "Download as text" No? Just this URL? Yes?
[23:22] <bobweaver> yeah great job computer  you have no clue how many people mess that up l;ol
[23:22] <escott> DevNull_, does your bios support the bluetooth keyboard
[23:23] <escott> DevNull_, unless your keyboard is working in your bios this is a bios issue and not an ubuntu one
[23:23] <DevNull_> Im actually on a macmini :( so I dont think it has a bios
[23:23] <escott> DevNull_, efi then
[23:23] <pianojake> hi i'm having trouble connecting to the internet via ethernet on ubuntu. i'm a new user so how would i go about doing this?
[23:24] <bobweaver> computer,  what about    apt-cache policy gnome-shell      pastebin that please
[23:24] <DevNull_> I was thinking after some research that my initramfs had to be modified by adding some modules and configurations to support bluetooth
[23:25] <escott> DevNull_, is your kernel outside your LUKS?
[23:25] <DevNull_> ya theres a seperate /boot partition
[23:25] <computer> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1525124/
[23:26] <bobweaver> computer,  this is what you have tried ?   http://askubuntu.com/questions/74300/how-to-login-into-unity-2d
[23:26] <Tex_Nick> 12.10 gnome classic ... my compiz cube works fine but 3d windows breaks the cube ... any help would be appreciated ... i know the cube is lame, but i like it :
[23:27] <escott> DevNull_, so who is asking for the password? the kernel or grub?
[23:27] <bobweaver> Tex_Nick,  Unity 3d is a compiz plugin kinda so if you mes with ccsm then you are also messing with unity 3d
[23:27] <computer> Yes tried that.....And some more.
[23:28] <bonez2046> I have a link to podcast I want to play, an .xml file. How can i play this podcast in ubuntu?
[23:28] <bobweaver> computer,  and when you type in    unity-2d-shell    into terminal does it launch ?
[23:28] <DevNull_> o I think the kernel for the luks password ... that is the most important I could live without the keyboard working in grub but I have to use another password to type in my encryption password
[23:29] <escott> DevNull_, I would check that the bluetooth modules are in /etc/modules and then update-initramfs
[23:29] <molgrum> i boot up a freshly installed ubuntu and grub says "error: file not found", i can write commands on "grub rescue" what should i do?
[23:30] <DevNull_> what about pairing ... will it take my desktop configuration or does it not need it?
[23:30] <computer> Lot of "WARNING" "DEBUG" and "CRITICAL" come up?
[23:30] <Tex_Nick> bobweaver : are you saying that my problem is using the gnome classic DE instead of unity is my problem ? :)
[23:30] <Stephini> would virtual core XTEST keyboard be the built in keyboard on the laptop? the word virtual is why i ask...doesn't seem very virtual...i figure virtual would be like OSK
[23:30] <bobweaver> ok computer  can you paste bin that ?
[23:30] <escott> DevNull_, I would assume that information eneds to be put in the initramfs
[23:31] <kross> hi
[23:31] <DevNull_> ya im having trouble figuring out how to do that bluetooth documentation is pretty weak
[23:31] <bobweaver> Tex_Nick,  kinda because Unity 3d it self depends on a certian setup of Compiz for it to work optimally. there are hacks out there that you can google but that said Unity 3d might crash on you here and there
[23:31] <kross> i want to remove those lilac boot picture or something and see whats going on during boot
[23:31] <computer> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1525141/
[23:32] <kross> like if you boot up in recovery mode
[23:32] <kross> i don't like those pictures at boot i need to know whats going on
[23:33] <escott> DevNull_, some arch instructions in the first comment
[23:33] <Tex_Nick> bobweaver : kinda what i expected ... hey thanks for the info :)
[23:33] <bobweaver> computer,  that is different are you sure that qtlibdee is installed that is kinda crazy Unity 2d calls in that package on install try this            open terminal   then presss ctrl+shift+t  (to open a new tab)  then type in    metacity --replace  &        then in a new tab type in    unity-2d-shell        does it launch ?
[23:33] <disharmonic> gn
[23:34] <escott> DevNull_, I dont think ubuntu uses mkinitcpio but it should give you a sense of what modules and files you need
[23:34] <bobweaver> Tex_Nick,  what version of Ubuntu are you on ?
[23:34] <Tex_Nick> quantal with gnome classic de
[23:34] <DevNull_> first comment? ya i found this https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mkinitcpio-bluetooth-input/ im trying to go through the code to see whats happening
[23:35] <angs> how to remove a directory on the command line?
[23:35] <bobweaver> cool Tex_Nick  I was going to offer something if you where on 12.04 :(  anyhow have a good one and again there are hacks out there for what you are looking for but they are not the most stable things
[23:35] <bobweaver> angs,  rm -r  folder/
[23:36] <DevNull_> and onscreen keyboard at the luks password screen would be good too if my mouse would work but I dont know if thats easier or eveen possible
[23:36] <angs> thank you bobweaver
[23:36] <Tex_Nick> bobweaver : lol i understand ... thanks again :)
[23:36] <bobweaver> angs,  it might be a good idea to read up on that command
[23:36] <computer> Window manager warning: Failed to load theme "Adwaita": Failed to find a valid file for theme Adwaita
[23:36] <escott> DevNull_, neither easier nor possible
[23:36] <bobweaver> computer,  I see want to try something that is 3rd party ? My Unity 2d ?
[23:36] <bonez2046> podcast playing? is .xml a podcast file type, could it be?
[23:37] <computer> OK
[23:37] <Tropetre> dr_willis: I could not seem to find the additional drivers utility for some reason... How do I launch it from a terminal window?
[23:37] <pianomantim> hey would anyone know how to connect to an ethernet internet connection?
[23:37] <kross> hello i asked something about the grub2
[23:37] <DevNull_> ya I think my best bet is to try to adapt the arch code but it doesnt seem to straight forward .... or just install arch...
[23:37] <escott> DevNull_, they make a good point in the comments about sniffing bluetooth.
[23:37] <kross> i entered noplymouth and i still see no text
[23:38] <kross> what kind of idiot removed the noplymouth entry in grub2 config of pangolin, it worked before now it doesnt

[23:39] <computer> Just before we start....Just like to say that a gnome style desktop has come up??
[23:39] <DevNull_> ya ive read about that too... not too worried about it but what are my other options ... get another keyboard?
[23:39] <eduardo> Why when I shutdown my computer, it says it will shutdown 1 minute after?
[23:39] <escott> DevNull_, if you are concerned about security enough to use luks then you should spend the $12 and buy yourself a keyboard with a cord

[23:48] <shell_> Super_Dog I just need it for system maintenance and file transfers/modifications. Do you know where I read up on this stuff?
[23:48] <cXhristian> I have a problem with sound volume, it's just way too loud. 5% of the volume is what I would consider to be a normal sound level, while anything over 20% is just too loud. I am using Ubuntu 12.10 and headset is Corsair Vengance 1500.
[23:48] <dr_willis> or soft<tab> i  dont know the name. and i just powered down the ubuntu box
[23:49] <Tropetre> dniMretsaM: I got GUI and terminal window but no menus and I'm trying to get to restricted drivers but I don't know how I am supposted to get there.
[23:49] <escott> DevNull2, i guess that has some value, but I would use an encrypted home for that not LUKS
[23:49] <Tropetre> dr_willis: Okay! I'll try!
[23:49] <escott> sevenforall, thats asymmetric encryption
[23:49] <dr_willis> Tropetre:  or you can get to it via synaptic i recall. or the software-center menus
[23:49] <dr_willis> bbl
[23:49] <escott> sevenforall, do you have that individuals id_rsa.pub?
[23:49] <rocky> hello
[23:50] <dniMretsaM> hi rocky
[23:50] <DevNull2> ya I guess I set it up cause I wanted to play around with Luks/LVM I might have to revert to encrypted home
[23:50] <sevenforall> escott: Eh, I guess not
[23:50] <rocky> can u guys let me know gotomeeting alike software in ubuntu?
[23:50] <escott> sevenforall, you need to get that first. you need their identity in your gpg keyring
[23:50] <sevenforall> escott: I recognize the id_rsa.pub from using SSH
[23:50] <sevenforall> escott: All I have is their public key, and I got that one
[23:50] <escott> sevenforall, it won't actually be "id_rsa.pub"
=== dark3n is now known as dark3n|off
[23:51] <escott> sevenforall, ok so you do have it
[23:51] <Super_Dog> shell_  :http://www.samba.org/
[23:51] <sevenforall> escott: And that -should- be all I need
[23:51] <sevenforall> I do
[23:51] <rocky> can u guys let me know gotomeeting alike software in ubuntu?
[23:51] <sevenforall> I was just confused by the id_rsa part, hehe
[23:51] <shell_> Thank super_dog
[23:51] <escott> sevenforall, does that individual appear when you gpg --list-keys
[23:51] <computer> Ok. Rebooted. Still no Unity 2D drop down on log in menu?
[23:52] <sevenforall> escott: It does indeed
[23:52] <sevenforall> escott: I can also use it to encrypt a file
[23:52] <Super_Dog> shell_ - There is also a samba setup utility - try typing "samba" in Unity file search and see if you have it installed already.  If not, pop it in with Software Center or Synaptic...
[23:52] <sevenforall> All in all, it works
[23:52] <Tropetre> dr_willis: gksudo software-properties-gtk seemed to do the trick! Thanks!
=== legrain is now known as slystone
[23:52] <bobweaver> computer,  try to launch it     unity-2d-shell
[23:52] <escott> sevenforall, then all you have to do is "gpg -e thefiletoencrypt.txt" and then enter the identifier for that key (usually an email address or the like)
[23:53] <Super_Dog> shell_ - mine is called "Samba Server Configuration Tool".   Looks kind of old / crusty though...
[23:53] <bobweaver> also computer  lets see a pastbin of    apt-cache policy unity-greeter
[23:53] <rocky> can u guys let me know gotomeeting alike software in ubuntu?
[23:53] <bobweaver> rocky,  I am not sure what you are saying
[23:53] <Sach> Using ubuntu 12.04, is it possible to record a video using my webcam? Perhaps on skype?
[23:54] <rocky> bobweaver, it is a screen sharing software with other users
[23:54] <andybrine> there are not many software applications similar to gotomeeting
[23:54] <rocky> bobweaver, what is am i asking foe
[23:54] <amoxibos> if my core gets dumped for some reason
[23:54] <amoxibos> where do i look for the dump
[23:54] <amoxibos> ?
[23:54] <andybrine> i use this product called talk fusion that works perfectly
[23:54] <bobweaver> rocky,  alot of us use google hangout
[23:54] <amoxibos> ulimit is set to unlimited
[23:54] <computer> sorry what was the url for the pastebin again?
[23:55] <andybrine> does anyone know a simple way to setup openvpn
[23:55] <andybrine> ?
[23:55] <sevenforall> escott: I was already able to do that, but I need a piece of text similar to the public key, but containing the message. How can I get that? I can't send him the gpg file I'm afraid.
[23:55] <bobweaver> computer,  paste.ubuntu.com
[23:55] <andybrine> so i can watch us programs in the uk?
[23:55] <sevenforall> escott: The gpg file is a pile of garbage when I open it with a text editor
[23:55] <rocky> bobweaver, i see is it very good in speed, i mean no lag
[23:55] <bobweaver> rocky,  like this ?  http://ubuntuonair.com/
[23:55] <escott> sevenforall, yes its encrypted
=== Krenair_ is now known as Krenair
[23:56] <sevenforall> escott: I figured, but the public key is encrypted in a way that there are reasonable characters, and a header that states the version and the fact that the block of encryted data starts there
[23:56] <andybrine> been searching for ages trying to get open vpn woking
[23:56] <sevenforall> escott: The piece of encrypted text needs to look similar to that
[23:56] <escott> sevenforall, you want it ascii armored
[23:57] <escott> sevenforall, try gpg -ea
[23:57] <sevenforall> escott: That sounds reasonable, let me try
[23:57] <sevenforall> escott: All in all, look like http://pastie.org/5675666
[23:57] <sevenforall> But a piece of text, rather then a public key. I'll try -ea
[23:57] <escott> sevenforall, the -a makes the output ascii armored
[23:57] <sevenforall> Let me check
[23:58] <andybrine> anyone have a simple tutorial to setup openvpn?
[23:58] <sevenforall> escott: Much better, thanks a lot :) And thanks for explaining it a bit rather than just giving the answer
[23:59] <computer> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1525192/      Command still seems to be running in terminal but here is output. Desktop has changed to what might be Unity 2D?
[23:59] <bobweaver> !vpn | andybrine  You have read this ?
[23:59] <ubottu> andybrine  You have read this ?: For more information on vpn please refer to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VPN
[23:59] <bobweaver> computer,  what about a pastebin of     apt-cache policy unity-greeter
