[03:10] <Free99> Hello everyone. Trying to make a high-availability KVM setup, but the only thing that is giving me trouble is figuring out how to use iptables
[03:11] <Free99> the setup is pretty simple, two machines that replicate the disk images for the VMs via drbd, and the VMs running on both machines for quick failover
[03:11] <Free99> issue is, there would be an ip conflict for each VM... any suggestions?
[03:13] <Free99> my idea is to use arptables and iptables to block off all of one of the machine's VMs while still letting DRBD and administrative access through
[03:15] <sarnold> Free99: wild guess here, but could you solve your problem by giving each vm two interfaces? give both vms a private IP and one vm a public IP, and use linux-ha or similar tools to failover to the other VM and takeover the public IP on its other interface?
[03:16] <sarnold> (you may be able to do it entirely with one interface, but two may be easier to use existing tools..?)
[03:18] <Free99> sarnold: well... I don't really know anything about linux-HA.. I have DRBD setup already, bridged networking, etc.. I'd just like to block everything that isn't going to the host VM, then use a sysctl to disable iptables and arptables if the other host goes down
[03:19] <Free99> I guess I'll go check on Linux-HA, but that implies adding new interfaces to every single one of my VMs, right?
[03:20] <patdk-lap> heh, would be so simple to use linux-ha (pacemaker)
[03:20] <patdk-lap> doesn't need to
[03:20] <patdk-lap> all depends on how you do your iptables config
[03:20] <Free99> oh wait, I'm using linux ha, specifically heartbeat! lol
[03:21] <patdk-lap> that is really old
[03:22] <Free99> patdk-lap: to be honest, haven't gotten to that point yet, still doing the DRBD setup, stuck on the iptables though
[03:22] <Free99> oh I see, I should have said pacemaker
[03:22] <Free99> my bad

[10:45] <blim_> hi, Does anyone know a guide on how to set the ToS (type of service) on a client os?
[11:17] <jabba_> hello
[11:17] <jabba_> i just setup a crypted partition (SR for a Xen-Server). and added it to the /etc/crypttab with the option "timeout=30". sadly the option seems to be ignored (as boot-process keeps going on) and i am not able to enter the passphrase at boot. anyone an idea what's wrong?
[11:18] <jabba_> referring to this bugreport: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cryptsetup/+bug/468208
[11:18] <uvirtbot`> Launchpad bug 468208 in cryptsetup "cryptsetup passphrase prompt at boot not working if waiting too long (w/o usplash)" [Undecided,Triaged]
[11:19] <jabba_> is it possible that it's an upstart relatet problem?
[11:20] <xnox> jabba_: cryptsetup unlocking is done in initramfs while talking to plymouth (these days)
[11:21] <xnox> jabba_: I didn't experience it timing out, but I did experience three attempts only.
[11:22] <xnox> jabba_: is your root file system encrypted or some other partitions?
[11:27] <jabba_> no, the encrypted partition in an SR (Storage Repository) for a Xen Hypervisor (XCP-XAPI). It is essential, that  this device is decrypted before the XCP-XAPI-Service starts.
[11:27] <jabba_> -in +is
[11:29] <jabba_> so is it possible at all to halt the boot-process for a defined time (waiting for the passphrase) and in the case of a timeout countinue booting without decrypting the partition?
[11:31] <jabba_> why is the timout-option not listed in the crypttab-manpage anymore?
[11:37] <jabba_> xnox: any idea?
[11:38] <xnox> jabba_: so when root is not encrypted, indeed upstart jobs unlock the partitions. it should be accepting options.
[11:45] <jabba_> xnox: so upstart is responsible for calling the cryptsetup scripts, BUT the main problem is, that the boot process doesn't get interrupted, for the defined time (timeout=30 in crypttab).
=== mcclurmc_away is now known as mcclurmc
[11:48] <xnox> the same way it does when rootfs is encrypted.
[11:49] <xnox> jabba_: where did you find reference to crypttab "timeout" option?
[11:49] <jabba_> http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man5/crypttab.5.html
[11:50] <xnox> jabba_: but that's for hardy. Are you running hardy? that option is not present in lucid and later.
[11:51]  * xnox is not entirely sure how cryptsetup is managed in hardy.
[11:52] <jabba_> xnox: the timeout option i missing in precise... is there a new way to handle this?
[11:52] <jabba_> *is
[11:53]  * xnox is looking into the history behind this: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=495509
[11:53] <uvirtbot`> Debian bug 495509 in cryptsetup "cryptsetup: timeout option does not work anymore" [Important,Fixed]
[11:55] <xnox> "* Completely remove support and documentation of the timeout option, document this in NEWS.Debian."
[11:57] <jabba_> can't believe it... that's really sad
[11:57] <xnox> well your problem seems to be that it's way too quick, instead of non-existing.
[11:58] <jabba_> xnox: could you explain this please?
[12:00] <xnox> jabba_: we are processing udev triggers and we should have approx. udev settle timeout to enter the passphrase which is ~30s long. yet earlier you said "i am not able to enter the passphrase at boot" meaning that even if there was a prompt, it vanished too quick.
[12:02] <jabba_> ok.. i must admit: "i can't follow" :/
[12:03] <jabba_> xnox: my udev settles to fast?
[12:03] <xnox> jabba_: I guess I need to experiment with a setup similar to yours. E.g. regular install and one non-essential luks encrypted mountpoint.
[12:03] <jabba_> and that's why the passphrase-promt timeouts to early?
[12:04] <xnox> I am speculating a little bit. But i am not spotting anything that will block boot to capture passphrase-promt.
[12:04] <xnox> for non-rootfs luks volumes.

[12:11] <xnox> no, it's been there since 2010, I assigned it to myself to check if it can be fixed or not.

[15:03] <Lovelidge> Is anyone on this channel?
[15:45] <Free99> hey everyone, I have a bridged connection that I need to filter. Should I use iptables+arptables, or will ebtables do the job of both?
[15:46] <patdk-lap> heh?
[15:46] <patdk-lap> that depends on what you want
[15:46] <patdk-lap> all 3 of those do totally different things
[15:46] <patdk-lap> if they did the same thing, they wouldn't all exist
[15:47] <Free99> yeah, that's kind of why I'm a little confused. I basically need to isolate my VMs which are connected via a bridge.. the VMs are replicants of the VMs on a different physical host, so there would be an ip conflict
[15:47] <Free99> the hosts watch each other using pacemaker, if one machine goes down, the other unblocks its VMs
[15:48] <patdk-lap> are you doing some kind of memory replication?
[15:48] <Free99> no, just DRBD. I had been wondering if that would work actually
[15:49] <patdk-lap> ya, your whole setup is fail
=== uksysadmin__ is now known as itarchitectkev
[15:49] <patdk-lap> kind about this, what happens when two computers use the same harddisk?
[15:49] <patdk-lap> it causes complete corruption
[15:50] <patdk-lap> your vm should only be running at one location at a time ever, then no harddrive corruption, no ip issues, ...
[15:50] <Free99> patdk-lap: so what could I do instead? I suppose I would just keep the VMs off on the other machine, keep their disk images synced though
[15:50] <patdk-lap> drbd keeps the disk images synced
[15:50] <patdk-lap> just have pacemaker start the vm on the other machine on failover
[15:50] <Free99> lol I dunno why I thought that'd work
[15:51] <Free99> well, just for my knowledge, if I need to filter these VMs, like for fencing or anything, how would I do that?
[15:51] <patdk-lap> depends :)
[15:51] <patdk-lap> you could use iptabls/ebtables/...
[15:51] <patdk-lap> all depends on what level/layer you want to do it at
[15:52] <Free99> getting conflicting advice saying iptables doesn't work on br0 and such, others saying it does
[15:52] <Free99> kind of don't know my dick from my elbow when it comes to networking haha

I've just got a new installation of 12.04 and am trying to set up a mail server following this guide: http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/edition11.html but I'm having issues with SASL. It shows up as Error: authentication failed: no mechanism available
[18:57] <sarnold> tflgen2: anything in the logs?

[23:25] <anti-neutrino>  I have a ubuntu-11.10 (Desktop) installation.. which I was using as a server (not using any gui feature of it)
[23:26] <anti-neutrino> can I just rip off the ubuntu-desktop package .. to make it as efficient as ubuntu-server
[23:26] <anti-neutrino> as I see on the ubuntu website .. they merged the generic and server kernl after 12.04 .. but I have 11.10 installation
[23:27] <anti-neutrino> this machine was suppoed to be only for testing .. but then we want to use it in the production too

[23:28] <sarnold> anti-neutrino: feel free to uninstall any packages you don't use.
[23:29] <sarnold> anti-neutrino: you'll make most impact by removing applications that are using the most amount of memory, but that can be a bit difficult to quantify

[23:30] <anti-neutrino> yeah I can do that too ..
[23:31] <anti-neutrino> so once again a naive question .. if kill X  .. it pops up again
