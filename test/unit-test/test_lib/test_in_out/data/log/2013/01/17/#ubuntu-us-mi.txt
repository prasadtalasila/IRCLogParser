[00:05] <snap-l> On the one hand, I think this is a newat dea
[00:05] <greg-g> lame no line wrapping
[00:06] <snap-l> on the other hand, I just thousands of dryer-fucking-with-bad-ground electonic musicicians giggle with glee.
[00:08] <snap-l> Oh, I just visted the site.
[00:08] <snap-l> Essentially, it's a list of videos and speeches featuring rms.
[00:10] <snap-l> Will be interesting seeing both dryer-fucking-with-bad-groud electronic music mingling with rms speeches
[00:11] <snap-l> maybe we could mash them together, or is that too Lessig
[00:31] <greg-g> snap-l: oh, cool, they're talking about MediaGoblin!
[01:11] <snap-l> Howdy.

[04:05] <snap-l> Hello from the bouncy ball chair and clicky keyboard. :)
[04:06] <snap-l> Pretty soon it's tiling windowmanagers all the way down, isn't it? ;)
[04:06] <snap-l> Pixel is liking my regular desk chair is free, though.
[04:08] <rick_h_> lol
[04:10] <snap-l> Funny enough, the ball expanded in the car because I had the heat on
[04:11] <snap-l> so what was initially a little push into the car became a little more interesting. :)
[04:11] <rick_h_> lol
[04:11] <rick_h_> air, gotta love it
[04:11] <rick_h_> just a little bit in there
[04:12] <snap-l> I can see why people like this. It's actually pretty comfortable.
[04:12] <snap-l> Will be interesting to see how Friday plays out.
[04:12] <rick_h_> yea, do it for a full work day and you'll find your stomach aching
[04:12] <rick_h_> it takes muscles to keep yourself centered/upright
[04:12] <snap-l> That's fine. Seems to be my weakest point
[04:12] <rick_h_> the other thing is that you lose height adjustment
[04:12] <rick_h_> so your desk needs to be about right
[04:12] <snap-l> I can't do a sit-up without feeling it vibrate under the strain
[04:12] <rick_h_> I had to bring the adjustable desk pretty low to get a good arm position for typing
[04:12] <snap-l> It's actually right around where my seat is
[04:13] <snap-l> I have short legs, so this is fine
[04:13] <snap-l> JoDee says I'm laying an egg.
[04:13] <rick_h_> lmao

[04:35] <snap-l> Man, it's going to be hard to wait until Februaryy.
[04:49] <Blazeix> rick_h_: btw, http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Awesome_3.4_to_3.5
[05:31] <snap-l> So pary of it is Lua is also changing.
[11:54] <snap-l> Good morning
[12:35] <rick_h_> morning

[16:51] <greg-g> why I never trusted Mendeley: http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/17/elsevier-mendeley-education/
[18:00] <n0p> sorry if this is a repeat, but anyone going to Stallman today? /cc jcastro
[18:01] <n0p> *to see
[18:01] <n0p> http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/etc/events/showevent.cgi?2548
[18:01] <greg-g> I would love to, I have no idea what he's talkinb about according to the anstract
[18:02] <greg-g> wow, cold hands make weird typos :)
[18:02] <jcastro> huh?
[18:02] <jcastro> n0p: are you joking?
[18:03] <n0p> no, was serious
[18:03] <n0p> as odd as he is, he is kinda a big deal, no?
[18:04] <jcastro> not to me he isn't. :p
[18:04] <greg-g> would be an interesting talk, regardless of the size of his deal
[18:04] <jcastro> I've seen one of his talks
[18:05] <jcastro> they're all the same
[18:05] <greg-g> that doesn't follow, but ok ;)
[18:05] <jcastro> I mean, if you have never seen one and want to go, then sure
[18:05] <rick_h_> meh, I respect the guy but no desire to get into the same room
[18:05] <jcastro> but I don't know why you'd want to go to that on purpose, but that's just me
[18:05] <rick_h_> lol
[18:05] <rick_h_> jcastro: woodworking tonight
[18:06] <rick_h_> http://www.semiww.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=12473
[18:06] <jcastro> rick_h_: I've got no time tonight unfortunately
[18:06] <rick_h_> all good
[18:06] <jcastro> rick_h_: I want to show you a pine breadbox I found at an antique place for like 20 bucks
[18:06] <jcastro> it's epic
[18:07] <rick_h_> nice!
[18:07] <jcastro> rick_h_: on the plus side, you'll be learning and collaborating with others. n0p will just be wasting his time.
[18:07] <jcastro> :)
[18:07] <rick_h_> ouch
[18:07] <rick_h_> how do you really feel?
[18:07] <n0p> :-) not sure if i'm going yet, was looking for more of a reason
[18:07] <jcastro> if you want to hang out and have a beer
[18:07] <jcastro> that would be way more fun
[18:08] <jrwren> jcastro: did you know AWS meeting was Tuesday night?
[18:08] <jcastro> jrwren: ! no
[18:08] <jcastro> dang, I need to get a car

[18:08] <jrwren> no car?
[18:08] <jrwren> you live right on bus line, don't you?
[18:09] <jcastro> yeah
[18:09] <jcastro> I have not yet gotten over the cold, I know, I know.
[18:09] <jrwren> any excuse is good by me. I never go anywhere.
[18:10] <jrwren> http://www.awsmichigan.org/  it still says meets in dexter, but it actually meets at Arbor Networks now

[19:01] <jcastro> that one is for you rick
[19:11] <rick_h_> lol
[19:12] <rick_h_> as someone that's done both it's not quite the same...but makse for a good joke
[19:28] <rick_h_> bwuahaha, love it when software fixes crap. seehttp://www.suntimes.com/sports/17633646-419/bears-coach-marc-trestman-feels-urgency-to-win.html vs http://r.bmark.us/u/205e0c34f284c5
[19:43] <n0p> i'm having weird magic mime type issues on 12.10, anyone running this care to test for me? https://gist.github.com/4559004
[19:44] <n0p> it's telling me it's a C++ file however other (older) boxes tell me php script
[19:44] <rick_h_> same here
[19:44] <n0p> :-/ ok, thanks
[19:46] <rick_h_> lol https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=526056
[19:46] <n0p> yeah, found someone report a php bug for it to, heh (not a php bug)
[19:47] <rick_h_> right, seems like upstream file'd made some choices
[19:47] <rick_h_> of course this link is from 2010 so :/
[19:48] <rick_h_> talk about hard things to google for though
[19:48] <rick_h_> file, mime, type
[19:48] <n0p> yeah
[19:48] <rick_h_> ]% mimetype /tmp/delme.php                                                                                    (rharding@toraken:~)
[19:49] <rick_h_> /tmp/delme.php: application/x-php
[19:49] <n0p> hmm, me too on that
[19:50] <n0p> annoying thing is, trying to fix something else, just that this is breaking a test for me to run local
[19:50] <n0p> no time for tangents
[20:00] <snap-l> file made some chages in later releases
[20:01] <snap-l> I remember file having some more useful "magic" in later releases
[20:26] <jrwren> google for coreutils file
[20:26] <jrwren> nope, even that doesn't work
[20:32] <n0p> i've moved on for now.. just commented the text so i could do my real issue. will have to look into the magic stuff later in my free time, ha!
[20:32] <n0p> s/text/test/
[20:32] <n0p> https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53035
[20:32] <n0p> not a php bug
[21:47] <snap-l> Tried to print out the Wired Larry Page article as a PDF
[21:47] <snap-l> apparently Wired is all about making paper look like shit.
[21:48] <snap-l> I'm pretty sure it's their mission statement.
[21:48] <snap-l> "make paper look like shit"
[21:48] <rick_h_> did you try to r.bmark.us it first?
[21:48] <rick_h_> :P
[21:48] <rick_h_> linky?
[21:56] <snap-l> http://www.wired.com/business/2013/01/ff-qa-larry-page/all/
[21:57] <snap-l> rick_h_: OK, r.bmark.us is FUCKING AWESOME
[22:01] <brousch> NEWSFLASH: EVERYTHING RICK_H DOES IS FUCKING AWESOME
[22:05] <_stink_> pip install rick_h
[22:05] <_stink_> now i have my very own!
[22:06] <snap-l> _stink_: I don't think you have all of the dependencies installed
[22:07] <_stink_> damnit
[22:07] <_stink_> pip install... woodworking?
[22:07] <snap-l> pip install subaru-outback. pip install clicky-keyboard
[22:07] <_stink_> hahaha
[22:07] <snap-l> pip install standing-desk
[22:09] <brousch> pip install live-in-doctor
[22:26] <rick_h_> you guys are evil
[22:27] <rick_h_> http://uploads.mitechie.com/larry_page.pdf so fail on the initial image thing
[22:27] <rick_h_> but seems like the rest is there/readable
[22:29] <rick_h_> so yea, missing the issue snap-l :P
[22:29] <rick_h_> http://r.bmark.us/u/6fd32dfd2d3def for the record there
[22:30] <rick_h_> ok, my work her is done. Off to woodworking.
[22:30] <rick_h_> here
[22:30] <rick_h_> doh
[22:36] <greg-g> hehe, someone I know at the RMS talk at UMich: "Listening to Stallman has the trappings of a sermon. A holy man tells us how to live. We nod our heads, but continue to sin."
[22:41] <brousch> I can officially make an app that runs on Linux and Android with Kivy
[22:41] <brousch> woohoo!
[23:14] <snap-l> iYours looks much better.
[23:14] <snap-l> Also, my chrome save to PDF looked awful by comparison
