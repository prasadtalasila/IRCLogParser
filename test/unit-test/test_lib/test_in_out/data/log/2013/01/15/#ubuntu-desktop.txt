[00:56] <robru> anybody know of a way to make launchpad recipes include a PPA for build-deps?
[00:57] <xnox> robru: one usually adds ppa dependencies to the ppa, and I thought recipes pull sources from the target ppa.
[00:57] <xnox> that should just work, tm. or it's a bug.
[00:58] <robru> xnox, I *thought* recipes would pull sources from the target PPA, but I just checked on a recipe for the first time in a while and I'm noticing that it hasn't actually built in a long time, because another package from the same PPA is not available
[00:58] <robru> xnox, https://launchpadlibrarian.net/128483890/buildlog.txt.gz quite strange
[00:58] <xnox> =( sad
[01:01] <xnox> yes, odd. file a bug on launchpad against launchpad or look for similar onces.
[01:01] <xnox> robru: i can see at the top of the log that the ppa is added, but then it's a mistery while the build dep was not satisfied.
[01:02] <robru> xnox, oh, that is quite strange.

[01:37] <jasoncwarner> hey bryce and RAOF , I'm getting some GPU hangs right now and was wondering if you knew anything about them? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/1099394
[01:37] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1099394 in xserver-xorg-video-intel (Ubuntu) "[sandybridge-m-gt2+] GPU lockup IPEHR: 0x0b160001 IPEHR: 0x01000000" [Undecided,New]
[01:43] <RAOF> jasoncwarner: Whaddaya know? I just got a GPU hang right then.
[01:44] <RAOF> Also apparently glyph cache corruption, causing all ‘y’s to appear as tiny subscript ‘t’s.
[01:45] <jasoncwarner> RAOF I had to reboot to get out of the endless GPU hang loop. Rebooted and got it again. Fun times :)
[01:45] <RAOF> I think I may have had to VT switch to get X back.
[01:45] <RAOF> Maybe.
[01:46] <RAOF> Mmm, glyph cache doesn't like ‘M’ either :)
[01:46] <RAOF> Looks like the same hang as in the bug you linked, though.
[01:50] <jasoncwarner> RAOF well, I guess I'm glad I got the same bug as an X guy ;)
[01:51] <didrocks> confirming the random hanging basically, same hw than jasoncwarner
[01:51] <didrocks> switching to a VT workaround the issue
[01:53] <jasoncwarner> didrocks did yours just start? mine seemed to just start today (not sure since I didn't have my computer up for three travel days)
[02:04]  * RAOF switches to SNA to see if that also hits this problem.
[02:10] <bryce> jasoncwarner, yeah noticed there's been a spate of -intel bugs come in the last few days.  Are you able to reproduce it fairly easily?  If so might try the prior kernel.
[02:11] <TheMuso> Yeah I was wondering whether 3.8 would bring along fun stuff like this? Had some 3.8 related audio bugs too afaicr.
[02:12] <bryce> jasoncwarner, hmm, the other -intel bug reports that have come in the last few days have all different error codes, so probably different random issues
[02:16] <RAOF> I'm not sure, but I don't *think* this was 3.8 related.

[07:55] <jibel> Good morning
[09:00] <Laney> pitti: you don't see the segfault-on-quit problems?
[09:00] <Laney> I saw it e.g. with gedit, epiphany
[09:00] <Laney> https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=690118
[09:00] <ubot2`> Gnome bug 690118 in general "Crash when closing last tab of a window using Ctrl-w" [Normal,New]
[09:01] <pitti> Laney: there was one failed test case in app-info, which I just uploaded a fix for
[09:01] <pitti> (due to one of our patches)
[09:01] <pitti> Laney: trying
[09:01] <Laney> perhaps that is fixed in .4; I just tried .3
[09:02] <pitti> Laney: I tried in gedit; closing two tabs
[09:02] <pitti> no crash here
[09:02] <Laney> let me try
[09:02] <pitti> the bug report is very unspecific, though
[09:03] <Laney> hm, not in svn?
[09:03] <pitti> Laney: no, I thought Debian doesn't want development releases?
[09:04] <Laney> I committed .3 there and nobody complained :P
[09:04] <Laney> didn't upload it yet though admittedly
[09:04] <pitti> oh, ok; then I can add my .4 stuff there, of course
[09:05]  * Laney builds .4
[09:07] <pitti> Laney: oh, I see a segfault when quitting gedit
[09:07] <pitti> not when closing the tabs
[09:07] <Laney> ah, yes, the bug is confusingly worded in that respect
[09:08] <pitti> Laney: sorry, I didn't notice that you already packaged .3; let me check my remaining delta
[09:08] <pitti> Laney: e. g. debian/rules still sets $G_HOME
[09:09] <Laney> yeah I left that for now for compatibility
[09:09] <pitti> oh, you mean you left the patch
[09:09] <pitti> ok
[09:09] <pitti> I dropped it in the PPA
[09:09] <Laney> there's a couple of packages that make use of it
[09:18] <pitti> Laney: mbiebl just pinged me about pre-release in svn, he was a bit surprised
[09:18] <Laney> oh, I thought he was aware as he saw me committing the other stuff
[09:18] <Laney> ah, he is here
[09:19] <Laney> mbiebl: ? (I don't mind uploading it to Ubuntu only if you'd prefer)
[09:19] <pitti> Laney: ok, I committed my updates to SVN now
[09:19] <pitti> that reverts my dropping of $G_HOME
[09:19] <pitti> (i. e. not commit it to SVN)
[09:19] <Laney> merci
[09:20] <pitti> that was .4, symbol update, fix broken test by 92_revert_appinfo_command_line.patch, and dropping 08_disable_gapplication_basic_test.patch
[09:20] <Laney> excellent
[09:21] <Laney> I think des_rt was looking into that other crasher
[09:22] <mbiebl> Laney: since exp has become somewhat of a staging ground for 3.6 during freeze,  I guess we'd need another branch for pre-releases
[09:22] <mbiebl> that said, pitti ist that symbols file breakage fixed by the above?
[09:22] <pitti> mbiebl: we actually want to run GNOME 3.6 with glib 3.5, FYI
[09:23] <pitti> (but yes, in general it would be cleaner to have another branch)
[09:23] <pitti> mbiebl: the removed symbols didn't come back, if you mean that
[09:23] <mbiebl> hm, ok.

[14:35] <Sweetshark> didrocks: yeah, well. I didnt fill the full SRU form for each bug (would just take too long), but made oneline rationale for each patch.
[14:36] <desrt> larsu: disagree
[14:36] <desrt> larsu: if we want not to show menus (or to disable them) when a transient is shown, we ought to do just that
[14:36] <desrt> on the unity side
[14:36] <didrocks> Sweetshark: hum, I think they will ask you for the SRU process on each bugs to be followed
[14:36] <didrocks> Sweetshark: but let's check that with your sponsor :)
[14:37] <larsu> desrt, how would unity know that a dialog is modal?
[14:37] <desrt> the dialog isn't exporting any menus
[14:37] <desrt> it's setting transient-for
[14:37] <desrt> and unity (or bamf?) is following that back to the parent
[14:37] <desrt> it should just stop doing that
[14:38] <larsu> well then the menus would be hidden
[14:38] <larsu> instead of disabled
[14:38] <desrt> we want them disabled, not hidden?
[14:38] <larsu> ya
[14:38] <larsu> mpt, right? ^^
[14:39] <desrt> hm.
[14:39] <desrt> load empty action groups into the widget's muxer
[14:39] <mpt> right
[14:39] <desrt> that'll disable them :)
[14:39] <larsu> that will cause roughly as much dbus traffic as disabling them one by one
[14:40] <larsu> actually, might even be more, because you need to copy the real actions back
[14:40] <desrt> larsu: no.  on the unity side.
[14:40] <desrt> there should be no changes made in the app
[14:40] <larsu> oh
[14:40] <larsu> OH!
[14:40] <desrt> native GMenuModel apps won't be doing this
[14:40] <larsu> yeah that works
[14:41] <larsu> desrt, why not?
[14:41] <desrt> why would they?
[14:41] <mpt> because their items continue working unless specified otherwise?
[14:41] <larsu> because dialogs don't have a menu?
[14:41] <desrt> from their viewpoint the menubar becomes inaccessible because it's part of the window and the modal dialog popped over it

[15:14] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1098549 in Telepathy Indicator "Chat windows should always be openend automatically (in the background)" [Medium,Triaged]
[15:14] <larsu> it's blocking a couple of other patches I have
[15:14] <larsu> (but it's not super-important)
[15:15] <kenvandine> ugh
[15:17] <kenvandine> larsu, empathy sees the channel request at the same time as tp-indicator, if it is running
[15:18] <larsu> kenvandine, ah, right, because empathy is also an approver. This doesn't fix the mein issue though: we want the chat window to pop up in the background but still have something in the indicator
[15:18] <larsu> afaics, telepathy doesn't have a way to provide for that
[15:19] <kenvandine> i don't think it does
[15:19] <kenvandine> the way we trigger empathy to raise the window is by approving it
[15:19] <larsu> yep, but that removes the message from the queue
[15:19] <kenvandine> empathy does know if the message is pending though, if the window/tab isn't focused it doesn't get cleared
[15:20] <kenvandine> i think
[15:20] <larsu> right, that works when the window is already open
[15:20] <larsu> not for the first time though
[15:20] <larsu> looks like we have to move messagingmenu support into empathy after all, but I'd really like to avoid that
[15:20] <kenvandine> because the window gets focus
[15:21] <larsu> no, not when you tell it through telepathy that this wasn't a user action
[15:21] <larsu> it will then open in the background (90% of the time :( )
[15:21] <kenvandine> ok, then maybe we can handle that
[15:21] <kenvandine> right now i think we only manage the pending messages on the observer
[15:22] <kenvandine> maybe we can wire that up differently in the approver
[15:22] <larsu> that would work from the indicator side, but empathy doesn't tell us when the window eventually does get focus
[15:23] <kenvandine> yes it does
[15:23] <larsu> it does? Cool!
[15:23] <kenvandine> look at the observer code
[15:23] <kenvandine> i think :)
[15:23] <kenvandine> telepathy keeps them in some pending queue
[15:23] <kenvandine> until the chat gets focus
[15:23] <larsu> I think it doesn't, because we've already approved it
[15:23] <larsu> I'll definitely have another look
[15:24] <kenvandine> please do
[15:24] <kenvandine> i think we consider it handled when we approve it
[15:24] <kenvandine> but then we start observing that channel
[15:24] <kenvandine> and we check for pending messages
[15:24] <kenvandine> maybe we can make that hand off differently
[15:25] <kenvandine> i haven't looked at that code in ages, but that feature in tp-glib  was added at my request
[15:25] <kenvandine> :)
[15:25] <larsu> oh, neat
[15:25]  * larsu is a bit annoyed at the complexity of telepathy
[15:25] <kenvandine> so maybe when we approve it, we don't clear it
[15:25] <kenvandine> and start checking for pending
[15:25] <kenvandine> before we clear
[15:25] <kenvandine> yeah... it is very complex
[15:26] <kenvandine> but also very cool :)
[15:26] <larsu> hehe
[15:26] <kenvandine> love to hate it :)
[16:26] <Laney> xnox: can you give me some more detail on how ubi failed for you please? seems to wfm: http://ubuntuone.com/4pLqMf5Q68ivybJLyd2C8g :-)
[16:27] <Laney> thanks for the exciting way to test it btw
[16:27] <Laney> installing ubiquity in a running system feels naughty
[16:27] <xnox> it's a .deb so why not =)
[16:28] <xnox> Laney: looks awesome! for me the viewport had "half of the language selection widget" from the previous page. but looks good =) so good to merge I guess ;-)
[16:28] <xnox> Laney: haha you use lastpass?!
[16:28] <Laney> maybe I have some stray gstreamer stuff installed?
[16:29] <xnox> maybe I didn't have enough installed?
[16:29] <Laney> should all be deps though
[16:29] <Laney> but you'd get something in the terminal if that's the case I suppose
[16:29] <Laney> also yeah, lastpass rules ;-)
[16:30] <xnox> meh, let's upload and see what happens, there are a few people who have webcams and can test iso images.
[16:30]  * Laney ph33rs
[16:30] <Laney> but ok
[16:31]  * Laney always feels compelled to make stupid faces while testing webcam stuff
[16:31] <xnox> I am dissapoint that nexus4 doesn't have usb host otg & i can't put yubikey into my phone =(
[16:32] <ogra_> you are one of the lucky ones ?
[16:33]  * ogra_ would be happy to be able to complain about nexus4
[16:34] <xnox> ogra_: haha =) I even got two, and sold one ;-)
[16:34] <Laney> you need a yubikey neo!
[16:34] <ogra_> evil!
[16:34] <xnox> Laney: that would be awesome =)
[16:35] <xnox> Laney: /me has three yubikeys already....
[16:35] <Laney> heh
[16:35] <Laney> $50 ...
[16:36] <xnox> We have sold out of our initial production runs; we are shipping YubiKey NEO in 5 - 7 weeks.
[16:36] <xnox> meh
[16:39] <miha> on ubuntu 10.04, evolution now complains about gmail imap ssl cert being "bad", while  openssl s_client -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -connect imap.gmail.com:993  works fine  <- what am i doing wrong (didn't change anything)
[16:40] <qengho> Hey, have we a meeting now?
[16:40] <jpds> miha: Don't use openssl, it doesn't do cert verification.
[16:40] <jpds> miha: Try gnutls-cli
[16:44] <Laney> qengho: I was assuming there wouldn't be one since people are away
[16:45] <qengho> Ah well. My status:
[16:45] <qengho> [desktop-r-chromiumbrowser-improvements]   6/12 DONE  2/12 deferable
[16:45] <qengho> - chromium-browser v23 released for all stable Ubuntu.  Fixes lots, but introduces one obvious brown-paper-bag bug.  :(
[16:45] <qengho> - Preparing v24 right now. Should release after #webapps patches are ported.
[16:45] <qengho> - Getting ARMv7 working so we can release on raring. NEON assumptions in build cause problems.
[16:45] <qengho> - Starting beta PPA process to get ahead of releases, so there's no release delay. #webapps on board with patching beta instead of stable.
[16:45] <qengho> EOF
[16:45] <kenvandine> yay for getting ahead :)
[16:45] <qengho> Yeah.
[16:46] <Laney> ah, you're waiting for armhf to be fixed before updating raring?
[16:46] <Laney> I noticed yesterday that it was behind Quantal
[16:46] <qengho> Laney: Yes.  That's a policy requirement.
[16:47] <Laney> well, it's already being held in raring-proposed because of the failure
[16:48] <miha> jpds: - The hostname in the certificate matches 'imap.gmail.com'.
[16:48] <miha> - Peer's certificate issuer is unknown
[16:48] <miha> - Peer's certificate is NOT trusted
[16:48] <cyphermox> miha: the ca chain is incomplete. is ca-certificates installed? (in case it wouldn't be for some reason)
[16:49] <cyphermox> or the new gmail certs are signed with a CA that isn't shipped in 10.04
[16:50] <miha> installed newest version
[16:50] <mlankhorst> oh right
[16:51] <cyphermox> miha: can you pastebin the output of openssl s_client -verify 6 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -connect imap.gmail.com:993 ?
[16:52] <cyphermox> (I added -verify 6)
[16:52] <qengho> miha: and specify what country you're in.
[16:52] <cyphermox> miha: btw; pastebin -> http://paste.ubuntu.com in case you're not familiar with this
[16:53] <mlankhorst> trying to get kernel fixes upstreamed, working on bugs related to lts stack for 12.04.2 release, trying to get my reservation changes reviewed again, hopefully for inclusion this time.
[16:53] <miha> ok
[16:53] <mlankhorst> EOF
[16:53] <xnox> Laney: do you use lastpass on your mobile? and how does that work?
[16:53] <Laney> xnox: I swear that OTG worked before but it doesn't now
[16:53] <Laney> perhaps a newer cyanogen broke it
[16:53] <cyphermox> xnox: Laney: is that why you mentioned the yubikey NEO?
[16:54] <Laney> but I just used it to c+p some passwords when setting up apps
[16:54] <Laney> yes
[16:54] <cyphermox> hmm
[16:54] <cyphermox> I never thought of this
[16:54] <xnox> Laney: ack.
[16:54] <miha> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1534747/  so who's hacking me? :)
[16:55] <cyphermox> hmm
[16:57] <cyphermox> unless there is something broken in how evo tries to speak TLS?
[16:57] <miha> http://www.wolfey.si/tmp/gmailssl.jpg here screenshot
[16:58] <cyphermox> miha: could you open a bug on launchpad and add a screenshot of the exact
[16:58] <cyphermox> ah!
[16:58] <miha> cyphermox: which goverment is trying to spy on me? :p
[16:59] <cyphermox> meh
[16:59] <cyphermox> I guess evo just doesn't do ssl quite right; it wouldn't be especially surprising
[16:59] <mlankhorst> NOT THE CORRECT ONE
[16:59] <mlankhorst> I like how people get angry about chinese spies
[16:59] <miha> cyphermox: i'm surprised cause it worked up to today
[17:00] <miha> update? expired cert?
[17:00] <miha> new cert from google :)
[17:00] <miha> just when i got home 2 hours ago i got this
[17:01] <miha> i could add exception, but i'm well paranoid ;)
[17:02] <mlankhorst> run in chrome, see if it complains
[17:03] <miha> chrome does imap?
[17:03] <mlankhorst> oh right
[17:06] <cyphermox> miha: that's interesting, it's indeed not the same cert
[17:07] <mlankhorst> miha: oh if you think you're paranodi.. would you rather have the us government or the chinese government spy on you
[17:08] <miha> mlankhorst: chinese. i dont plan to go there anytime soon. :)
[17:08] <miha> we in nato, so usa is more dangerous ;)
[17:08] <cyphermox> mlankhorst: do we really need to have this kind of conversation here?
[17:08] <mlankhorst> :D
[17:08] <cyphermox> miha: what about the IP of imap.gmail.com, what do you get from your location?
[17:08] <cyphermox> dig imap.gmail.com
[17:09] <miha> cyphermox:

[17:10] <Sweetshark> ricotz: If you have a minute, could you have a look at the 3.6.4 backport for precise, that boaz did at: https://launchpad.net/~bdcomp/+archive/backports/+packages ?
[17:11] <cyphermox> miha: might you be behind a captive portal of some sort?
[17:12] <miha> cyphermox: well i get same error if i turn my vpn on or off
[17:13] <miha> they are on different networks, so i doubt it
[17:13] <miha> hm
[17:13] <cyphermox> is your vpn encrypted, and actually replacing the default gateway?
[17:15] <miha> it's my openvpn server, tls, 2048 bit rsa, 128 bit blowfish, after http://wiki.debian.org/OpenVPN#TLS-enabled_VPN
[17:16] <miha> well, i don't know how secure it is. but i doubt same attacker would set both local wifi and my vpn :p
[17:18] <miha> guess will try again at work
[17:40] <miha> thunderbird didn't complain about ssl
[17:43] <ricotz> Sweetshark, the packaging diff looks reasonable, but i would prefer to use backported dependencies like cmis > 0.2 and a not cluttered changelog
[17:44] <ricotz> (so i wouldnt want to have a binary copy of it in the libreoffice ppa)
[17:45] <ricotz> Sweetshark, i am hoping i will find a moment this week to look at it further
[17:51] <Sweetshark> ricotz: yeah, I had short look at the changelog and would have uncluttered it a bit too. Note though, that I mailed boaz and giving him green light to copy that one over to the libreoffice PPA if he did some testing with it.
[17:52] <Sweetshark> ricotz: those changes are nice to have, but not critical blockers IMHO. Lets keep boaz motivated, we can need every helping hand ;)
[17:53] <Sweetshark> ricotz: In case you didnt notice I also backported some 20 patches on top of 3.5.7/precise and uploaded that to the libreoffice-3-5 PPA. This is in preparation of the bug 1037111 SRU.
[17:53] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1037111 in libreoffice (Ubuntu Precise) "[SRU] LibreOffice 3.5.7 for precise" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1037111
[17:55] <ricotz> Sweetshark, oh, havent noticed that yet, thanks
[18:00] <Sweetshark> ricotz: If you want to contribute to the admittedly rather boring task of testing that package and verifying the fixes, you are most welcome of course ;) -- its 20 patches, thus I so far only created a one-line rationale for backporting them on bug 1037111 instead of filling the full SRU-form for all of them.
