[15:24] <britt__> hey guys
[15:28] <britt__> I just reported bug 1095674 about the gnome-control-center not showing "software-sources" or "ubuntuone" in the Raring dev release
[15:28] <ubot5> bug 1095674 in gnome-control-center (Ubuntu) "Software-Sources and Ubuntuone missing from gnome-control-center in Raring" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1095674
[15:28] <britt__> do any of you have that problem?
[15:29] <jbicha> britt__: that's a feature not a bug
[15:29] <britt__> jbicha why wouldn't we want it to show software sources?
[15:29] <jbicha> those items are still accessible in the Activities Overview
[15:30] <jbicha> if we're trying to be a mostly pure GNOME distro, then we should ship System Settings as close as possible to how GNOME intends
[15:30] <britt__> yeah I saw that, and also within the software center
[15:30] <britt__> I guess, but that is a very "system settings-ish" thing and was very usefull
[15:31] <jbicha> also, Ubuntu One and Software Sources don't integrate right with System Settings as they are external "pop-ups" instead of embedded into the main window
[15:31] <britt__> I gotcha
[15:31] <britt__> so we are running two separate system settings packages now with main ubuntu, one strictly for unity?
[15:32] <jbicha> no, it's one package but it looks different if run from Unity
[15:32] <jbicha> XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity gnome-control-center
[15:32] <jbicha> ^ run that to see the other style
[15:33] <britt__> yes but there is a new package in the repos called gnome-control-center-unity that is a dependency of ubuntu-desktop
[15:33] <jbicha> that's currently just the Appearance panel
[15:34] <britt__> gotcha gotcha
[15:34] <britt__> I see the differences
[15:35] <britt__> man my OCD goes crazy when there are things in the application window that are settings specific, and not in system settings
[15:35] <britt__> or in Unity's case, they are in system settings AND the app launcher
[15:35] <britt__> I see the pure-gnome POV, but it fractures the usability a bit
[15:36] <britt__> however it is minor to say the least
[15:36] <jbicha> well GNOME has this mockup: https://live.gnome.org/Design/SystemSettings/Sharing but unforunately I doubt Ubuntu One or Landscape would use it instead of their unique apps
[15:38] <jbicha> while Ubuntu One is cool, the UI doesn't fit with GNOME and the Ubuntu One management seems to have no desire to improve that
[15:38] <britt__> yeah, and they are both qt I believe which breaks away from gtk+
[15:39] <britt__> which is crap, because the ubuntu-specific-bonuses is the one thing that makes me keep coming back to ubuntu rather than others
[15:39] <jbicha> Software Sources is python+gtk (and it's also accessible from Software Center which is ok too)
[15:40] <britt__> do you know why they are so stuck on the ubuntuone-control panel being so dang ugly? I dont understand why the windows and osx control panels look better than the one designed for ubuntu
[15:40] <britt__> heck the phone versions look better
[15:41] <jbicha> I submitted UI bugs immediately after the Qt version landed in Ubuntu by default but they've been ignored
[15:41] <britt__> yeah you aren't the only one. Omgubuntu has been ranting on it for well over a year
[15:41] <britt__> it is attrocious
[15:42] <britt__> and has NOTHING to do with any of the other themes
[15:42] <britt__> grey dull background, weird rounded corners
[15:42] <jbicha> we might include U1 by default any way (we already ship most of the libraries it needs)
[15:42] <britt__> too bad we cant use the old gtk interface that it used to have
[15:43] <britt__> that one was ok
[15:43] <britt__> better than the new one, albeit less featurefull
[15:44] <britt__> speaking of "by default". Have we made any decision on Libreoffice over abiword and gnumeric?
[15:45] <britt__> opening abiword and libreoffice-word side by side they look nearly identical, though abiword is far far behind
[15:46] <britt__> I either think we include no-default office program, or it be libreoffice
[15:46] <britt__> because it bugs me having to break ubuntu-gnome-desktop meta dependency just to remove it
[15:52] <jbicha> you don't have to break anything, abiword & gnumeric are just recommends
[16:28] <jbicha> britt__: no, ubuntu-standard is the base of Ubuntu (server, Kubuntu, etc), ubuntu-desktop is the one with all of the gnome, unity, firefox etc. dependencies
[16:29] <britt__> hrm
[16:29] <britt__> I was wrong then
[16:29] <britt__> I just remember removing default ubuntu apps and not having them pulled back in on reinstalling ubuntu-desktop
[16:30] <britt__> is there a way they are installed by default but not a ubuntu-desktop dependency?
[16:30] <britt__> I dont know how ubiquity works with installations
[16:30] <jbicha> it might be useful to have a ubuntu-gnome-desktop-extras package but I don't want to be the one maintaining that
[16:31] <britt__> haha
[16:31] <britt__> yeah more work is never good
[16:32] <britt__> I'm just thinking along the lines of trying to get this remix to be an official derivative. And things like would probably add to the credibility of the project
[16:33] <britt__> the work done to differentiate the unity/gnome hybrid components has been fantastic
[16:33] <britt__> if that was you who did that, well don sir
[16:33] <britt__> done*
