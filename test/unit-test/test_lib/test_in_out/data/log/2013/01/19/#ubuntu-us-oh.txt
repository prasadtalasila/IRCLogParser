[18:53] <Cheri703> anyone want to help me try to figure out some computer issues?
[18:54] <Cheri703> I'm having some random issues with my Ubuntu 12.04 installation, and I'm thinking it could be hardware issues. One is that Synergy (www.synergy-foss.org) randomly disappears every few days, also today Ubuntu one just refuses to work. Another is that occasionally the computer just starts hanging and then needs a reboot but freezes during the shutdown process so I have to press/hold the power button. From everything I can find, my HDD is ok,
[18:54] <Cheri703> but I have no idea what other hardware I should be checking/replacing
[18:55] <toddcnb> whole p2v copy for now but i have recommended a clean os and just copy drupal 8
[18:55] <Cheri703> wat?
[18:58] <toddcnb> wrong channel never mind--I hate touch pads
[18:58] <Cheri703> ok, I was like O_o
[18:59] <thafreak> yeah Cheri703 you need to p2v your machine and put it in the cloud
[18:59] <Cheri703> apparently!
[18:59] <thafreak> but seriously
[19:00] <thafreak> I've had problelems with synergy myself
[19:00] <thafreak> it's been pretty much totally unreliable anymore
[19:00] <thafreak> I had a desktop and a laptop next to each other
[19:00] <toddcnb> no just coping a real server to a proxmox vm server
[19:00] <thafreak> and basically just dropped the desktop and plugged the monitor into my laptop...works MUCH better
[19:01] <Cheri703> yeah I've been having other issues too though
[19:01] <thafreak> well, I can attest to the synergy problems may just be synergy's fault at least :)
[19:01] <Cheri703> good to know :)
[19:02] <Cheri703> in general though this thing has been really moody
[19:02] <Cheri703> :/
[19:03] <Cheri703> like stuff just crapping out randomly
[19:03] <Cheri703> strange things
[19:04] <Cheri703> not sure what would cause that
[19:04] <thafreak> maybe it's going around like the flu
[19:04] <Cheri703> and same stuff happened right after a clean install
[19:04] <thafreak> skellat said he lost a bunch of hardware
[19:06] <Cheri703> things starting to display weirdly, stuff will be fine for a while, then suddenly when I click on like a panel icon the menu stuff will not display or will only display behind things, just strange hiccups and such. and again the freezing/shutdown thing
[19:06] <Cheri703> :s
[19:06] <thafreak> what graphics card do you have?
[19:06] <Cheri703> interested in getting a dockable laptop, but that'll cost like 3-4x what a desktop will
[19:06] <Cheri703> uhm, some ati thing
[19:06] <Cheri703> got it on amazon :)
[19:07] <thafreak> i have the strangest problems on my work computers which all have ati
[19:07] <thafreak> but I have my older laptop at home with an nvidia card, and it also exhibits strange graphics hiccups like you mention
[19:07] <thafreak> so who knows
[19:08] <thafreak> i think computers are just out to shorten my life
[19:08] <Cheri703> and shrink the bank account
[19:08] <thafreak> yeah...seriously...
[19:08] <thafreak> every time I get a nice check for doing a crap ton of side work...
[19:09] <thafreak> I end up spending it all..replacing parts/building replacement systems
[19:09] <Cheri703> other than my netbook and this macbook my work gave me, NONE of my systems were purchased new
[19:09] <Cheri703> all hand-me-downs, the desktops particularly, but a few laptops too
[19:09] <thafreak> but I'm actively working on reducing the number of machines I have now...replacing with newer/energy efficient stuff
[19:10] <thafreak> haha...I haven't built a desktop for my self in probably 8 years :(
[19:10] <thafreak> i just end up using something that I used to use as a server here and there...so basically hand me downs
[19:11] <thafreak> last good-ish graphics card I bought was agp...
[19:11] <Cheri703> yeah, I think I might build myself a desktop, then it can replace my tv computer/server at whatever point I buy a nice laptop in the future
[19:11] <thafreak> i still have it somewhere in my basement too...just no agp mother boards anymore
[19:12] <thafreak> that's the way to go
[19:12] <thafreak> I'm in the process of getting a new low power machine to replace my not that old VM host...
[19:12] <thafreak> since I don't really run that many intensive vm's anyway...
[19:13] <thafreak> then I get the couple year old beast of a server for my gaming desktop...just needs a graphics card
[19:13] <thafreak> and honestly, I probably spend most of my money on damn hard drives realistically
[19:14] <Cheri703> yeah, for once I'm good on hard drives at the moment
[19:14] <thafreak> 4 hard drives that are at that sweet spot of size/price usually sets me back $500-600...
[19:15] <thafreak> well, I hope I don't have to replace these WD red drives for a LONG time...
[19:15] <thafreak> or I may just give up on the dream of having a home NAS box...
[19:46] <Cheri703> this thing holds a billion drives: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112300

[19:52] <Cheri703> processors are where I get lost
[20:01] <Cheri703> amd vs intel, i5, i7, athlon, phenom, I don't even know where to start. anyone a cpu guru?
[23:26] <dzho> Cheri703: when I was last building a box, I built with amd because I wanted the cheapest thing that could still do hardware virtualization
[23:27] <dzho> but at work now I spec minimum of i5 because its the minimum Intel proc that does hardware virt
[23:28] <dzho> I think the conventional wisdom is that Intel has left amd in the dust on the current generation of processors
[23:28] <Cheri703> :/
[23:28] <Cheri703> we'll see.
[23:28] <dzho> ah, made your choice?
[23:28] <Cheri703> trying to decide if I should just go ahead and get myself a nice dockable laptop, even though work gave me a macbook air
[23:28] <Cheri703> not sure. looking based on price
[23:29] <dzho> ah, an air.
[23:29] <Cheri703> it's...eh
[23:29] <dzho> going to put or have you already put linux on it?
[23:29] <Cheri703> like...it works fine
[23:29] <Cheri703> I have it on vm because I have to use ms office
[23:29] <dzho> ah
[23:29] <dzho> you could put the proprietary os on vm ;-)
[23:29] <dzho> but yeah
[23:30] <dzho> $SPOUSE has an air
[23:30] <Cheri703> 128gb ssd, so if I left osx partition, then ubuntu partition, then win vm, no space for anything
[23:30] <dzho> the form factor I like quite a bit
[23:30] <Cheri703> yeah, the hardware is nice
[23:30] <Cheri703> the software eh
[23:30] <dzho> well, I don't like the "we glued everything inside the case"
[23:30] <dzho> but since it's new enough that's less an issue now
[23:30] <dzho> or, for now, I should say.
