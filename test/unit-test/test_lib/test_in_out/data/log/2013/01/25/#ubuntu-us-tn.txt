[19:05] <wrst> afternoon chris4585
[19:16] <chris4585> morning wrst
[19:17] <wrst> how you doing chris4585?
[19:19] <chris4585> alright, I got this the other day http://chris4585.tumblr.com/post/41313889346/i-received-my-patriot-extreme-intel-limited
[19:21] <wrst> sweet chris4585 :)
[19:21] <wrst> i switched over to cinnamon on my laptop
[19:21] <chris4585> nice
[19:22] <wrst> i must say i like it i just prefer gnome, but not gnome shell, so it seems to be a good way to have it all
[19:22] <chris4585> I personally love it, I use the same extension on it I do on gnome
[19:22] <chris4585> so it somehow just works nicely
[19:22] <wrst> 16GB of ram goodness
[19:23] <chris4585> indeed
[19:23] <wrst> yeah chris4585 and i tried out Nemo last night
[19:23] <wrst> beats the pants off of nautilus it seems
[19:23] <chris4585> its rather nice, so far haven't went over 4.7gbs just using chrome and OS
[19:24] <wrst> that's a bunch of ram
[19:24] <wrst> i should say i loved nautilus until the gnome team felt they needed to take all the features out of it
[19:24] <chris4585> wrst, lol yeah, nemo is basically a fork but its just what I love, and I trust mint to not make stupid choices
[19:24] <chris4585> yeah know devs are retarded :)
[19:24] <chris4585> gnome*
[19:25] <wrst> yeah you would think they would be better at usability than mint but gnome isn't
[19:25] <chris4585> if gnome was a country it would be china or north korea
[19:26] <chris4585> they just don't listen
[19:27] <wrst> good way of putting it, they have the ability to be great but...
[19:27] <wrst> gnome 2.x was so good for so long
[19:31] <wrst> i think they would have been better to have kept the gnome 2 feel but update it much like many of the extensions do or what cinnamon does
[19:34] <chris4585> yeah
[19:34] <chris4585> I imagine gnome will eventually die out due to lack of interest and cinnamon will flourish
[19:36] <wrst> yes the gtk backend stuff is all good but...
[19:40] <chris4585> actually it would be wonderful it people jumped ship
[19:40] <chris4585> I think mint has the capabilities of literally leading linux to victory they just need the resources
[19:41] <wrst> they do provide a very usable nice desktop, I think I'm going to put my mom on mint cinnamone
[19:41] <wrst> *cinnamon
[19:45] <chris4585> nice
[19:45] <chris4585> as far as ubuntu goes, I'm staying away from unity until they add reasonable options for unity
[19:46] <chris4585> even then manjaro is working wonderful with cinnamon
[19:47] <wrst>  i just installed cinnamon from the aur
[19:47] <wrst> i just need to get everything integrated with Nemo then i shoudl be good to go
[19:48] <wrst> dropbox looks to be fine i think there is a package just need to get ubuntuone working
[19:52] <chris4585> nice
[19:54] <wrst> funny thing an update to some package broke ubuntuone, ubuntuone team didn't want to fix it but they eventually will but the packager just patched it and released a fix that is cool
[19:56] <chris4585> awesome sauce
[19:57] <wrst> yes very cool
[19:57] <wrst> gotta love that
[20:29] <chris4585> yeah
