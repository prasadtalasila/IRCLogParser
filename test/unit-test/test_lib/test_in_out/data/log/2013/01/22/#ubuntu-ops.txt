[02:10] <Corey> Slow learner?
[02:14] <IdleOne> Corey: could you repeat that. i didn't understand it the first time
[02:15] <Corey> "Let me dumb it down for you" and other phrases you should never use at work. :-)
[04:15] <bazhang> <julian-delphiki> marta: i can look at it if you give me an ssh login
[04:15] <bazhang> is that like *worse* than teamviewer?
[04:17] <IdleOne> yes
[04:18] <IdleOne> with team viewer you can limit what the user can can't do (with ssh also) but with ssh you can't see what is happening while it happens
[04:18] <IdleOne> can or can't*
[04:19] <bazhang> thats what I suspected
[04:23] <IdleOne> warning given, now the user can do what they like I suppose
[04:26] <IdleOne> As a sysadmin he should know better then to even ask for ssh access.
[04:26] <IdleOne> wonder how he would feel if someone on one of the system he admins gave ssh to a stranger
[06:08] <Tm_T> I'd be against allowing "give me ssh access" requests in our support channels in the first place
