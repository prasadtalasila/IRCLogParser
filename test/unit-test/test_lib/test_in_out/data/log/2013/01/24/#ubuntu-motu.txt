[12:07] <Rhonda> rotfl @ wesnoth-editor "screenshot" …
[12:07] <Laney> haha
[12:08] <Rhonda> At least someone got a sense of humor. :)
[12:08]  * Rhonda . o O ( I still consider it not really an appropriate screenshot … )
[12:14] <nigelb> Rhonda: where?
[12:14] <Rhonda> nigelb, http://screenshots.debian.net/package/wesnoth-editor
[12:14] <nigelb> oh. lol.
[12:14] <Rhonda> (or in software center I would assume)
[12:15] <nigelb> Heh, I see it in packages.debian.org :)
[12:15] <Rhonda> Or packages.ubuntu.com :)
[13:05] <Laney> wrote my first executable debhelper file
[13:05] <Laney> not sure if it's great or awful
[13:11] <Rhonda> I read awful as helpful.  You make it sound so pessimistic instead. :)
[13:12]  * tumbleweed crosses himself and steps away from Laney
[13:30] <xnox> Laney: congrats =) i'm scared of executable debhelper files a little..... it's on a path to non-deterministic builds.

[14:16] <Laney> xnox: well, it's nothing you couldn't do in rules anyway if you wanted to
[14:16] <Laney> if I didn't have this I would have written basically the same code in there
[14:17] <xnox> true
[14:18] <Laney> well, or enumerated the list of files :P
[14:19] <Laney> might be /slight/ overkill ;-)
[14:19] <Laney> that brownie was over too fast :(

[16:58] <Rhonda> erm, what the …  receiving mail that someone gets errors when they want to look up jaunty packages?
[16:58]  * Rhonda nibbles on Laney.  Baaad idea for convincing me to put my mail address there.  %-/
[16:58] <Laney> haha
[17:00] <Laney> Take it away and redirect people to this channel instead?
[17:00] <Laney> or the motu ML or so

[19:51] <t4nk216> Hi, I have a question about packaging. I am trying to create packages with tracks and trains for openBVE (train simulator) (see https://launchpad.net/~kaero-ms/+archive/openbverat). These should be only data packages, no binary. For some trains, manuals in pdf should be attached. Where should be such pdf installed, so user can find them?
[19:52] <jtaylor> usr/share/doc/<package-name> is the normal location
[19:52] <t4nk216> Thanks for any help
[19:52] <t4nk216> jtaylor: so the format pdf is not a problem?
[19:53] <jtaylor> there is some doc-base registration to register them somewhere
[19:53] <jtaylor> t4nk216: if the source is available no
[19:53] <jtaylor> the pdf must be built from source
[19:53] <t4nk216> the source of pdf is unavailable
[19:54] <jtaylor> thats a problem
[19:59] <t4nk216> ok, i found something how to make doc-base registration, I will try to dig more. thanks.

[22:34] <blackz> micahg, jtaylor: xchat patch (bug #1090842) doesn't work for me on amd64. does it for you?
[22:34] <ubottu> bug 1090842 in xchat (Ubuntu) "FTBFS: in raring pyconfig.h is in /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/python2.7 or .. /i386-linux-gnu/.." [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1090842
[22:36] <jtaylor> it did when I wrote it
[22:36] <jtaylor> lets try again
[22:40] <jtaylor> hm no it does not work
[22:40] <jtaylor> I guess the package does not autoreconf
[22:40] <jtaylor> the patch is based for upstream, so it patches configure.in
[22:42] <blackz> jtaylor: will you modify it? or do you want me to do it?
[22:42] <jtaylor> you can do it if you like
[22:43] <blackz> jtaylor: ok
