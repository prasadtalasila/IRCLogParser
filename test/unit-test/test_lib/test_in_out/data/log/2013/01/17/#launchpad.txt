[13:34] <DMill> hey guys I've got a question regarding embargoed/proprietary projects?
[13:35] <DMill> actually let me start that over
[13:36] <DMill> I currently have a fully proprietary project, I was wondering if it were possible to only give access to say... Bugs to some users via sharing policies (users are invited to the project)
[13:36] <DMill> or another example would be, to allow to pull from branches but not push
[13:37] <czajkowski> DMill: you control all the sharing policy via /+sharing on each project
[13:37] <czajkowski> you can share what you need per person/team and what can be done via that settings
[13:37] <DMill> yeah but I can't seem to accomplish the above
[13:38] <czajkowski> let me try and find the blog post on it
[13:38] <czajkowski> one moment
[13:39] <czajkowski> http://blog.launchpad.net/general/information-sharing-is-now-in-beta-for-everyone
[13:39] <DMill> sorry for the bother, I did try searching around for the information i swear!
[13:39] <czajkowski> see the diagrams/vide
[13:39] <czajkowski> video
[13:40] <czajkowski> DMill: np, info is usually on the blog as well as help.launchpad.net
[13:40] <czajkowski> just heading for lunch but will be back in a bit
[13:40] <czajkowski> if you ned more help please file a answer on LP
[13:40] <DMill> have a nice lunch
[13:40] <DMill> thanks again

[17:41] <shadeslayer> hi, our PPA was recently allowed access to armhf builds, but the first build I uploaded failed with a weird error
[17:41] <shadeslayer> https://launchpadlibrarian.net/128669421/buildlog_ubuntu-raring-armhf.plasma-mobile_3.0-0ubuntu1~ppa2_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz
[17:41] <shadeslayer> Inconsistency detected by ld.so: rtld.c: 1311: dl_main: Assertion `_rtld_local._dl_rtld_map.l_libname->next == ((void *)0)' failed!
[17:41] <czajkowski> :/
[17:41] <czajkowski> shadeslayer: did it fail before using non ARM ?
[17:42] <shadeslayer> huh? you mean on x86? nope, built fine on both x86 and x86_64
[17:43] <czajkowski> shadeslayer: let me go and ask someone
[17:43] <czajkowski> two ticks
[17:43] <shadeslayer> sure :)
[17:51] <czajkowski> shadeslayer: I've asked deryck he's on a call atm.
[17:52] <shadeslayer> np, take your time :)
[17:52] <shadeslayer> czajkowski: https://launchpad.net/bugs/1077116 < yofel reported that, so it *might* be related

[20:23] <shadeslayer> czajkowski: any updates? :)
=== deryck[lunch] is now known as deryck
[20:29] <deryck> shadeslayer, does it build locally for you?
[20:30] <shadeslayer> as in on actual ARM hardware?
[20:30] <shadeslayer> or via qemu
[20:31] <yofel> as for my experience: builds on hardware, fails in qemu
[20:31] <shadeslayer> I'll testbuild on the arm machines I have access to :)
[20:44] <roadmr> hey folks, I uploaded a couple of packages to a ppa and I didn't get any sort of confirmation that they were uploaded :( nor do they appear on the PPA or build queue. How can I see what happened?
[20:48] <yofel> the same ^ happened to me and Riddell - is the import job down?
[20:53] <roadmr> yofel: sorry it's not working for you :/ but it's kinda comforting knowing that it's not something I did wrong :D
[20:53] <stgraber> I poked one of the sysadmins internally, it's being looked at (I was also affected)
[20:54] <roadmr> stgraber: thanks :)
=== Ursinha is now known as Ursinha-afk
[21:24] <stgraber> roadmr, yofel: problem has been fixed. Someone may try to do a mass re-process of the uploads if possible, but feel free to re-upload if you don't want to wait :)
[21:24] <roadmr> stgraber: \o/ marvelous, thanks!
[21:24] <yofel> yay, thanks
[21:27] <teolemon> fyi, we now have timeouts on save and continue on the ddtp, in addition to the classic bugs
