[00:21] <bryce> stgraber, is there a way to get pastebinit to post to paste.canonical.com or does the need for 2fa interfere with that?
[00:37] <stgraber> bryce: it's sadly not possible. One way would be for IS to allow posting without authentication and only requiring authentication to access the pastes, I mentioned it a couple of times in #is but nothing was done.
[00:38] <bryce> mm
[00:38] <bryce> stgraber, ok thanks
[00:39] <bryce> stgraber, would be nice having some way to get X logs shared to co-workers for private projects.  Back to scp I guess.  :-)
[00:54] <robru> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/raring-desktop-armhf+omap4.img 22MBs??! is that right>
[00:54] <robru> ??
[01:07] <TheMuso> robru: No I don't think so.
[01:12] <robru> hmmm
[01:12] <robru> TheMuso, any tips on how to get my pandaboard up and running?
[01:15] <sarnold> robru: I installed my pandaboard with 12.04's prepared filesystem image and upgraded to 12.10 a few minutes later (the prepared filesystem approach looked way simpler)
[01:15] <bryce> robert_ancell, where are you hung up?
[01:15] <bryce> bah
[01:15] <bryce> robru, where are you hung up?
[01:16] <bryce> robru, I referenced ogra's google hangout walk-thru.  It took me a few tries but I got set up on both quantal and raring
[01:17] <robru> bryce, well, I'm following https://wiki.canonical.com/UbuntuEngineering/QA/PandaboardNotes except that the filesystem image that it told me to download is only 22MBs, as if 22MBs was large enough for a full raring install
[01:18] <robru> so for laughs I just went and grabbed an android image for this thing, and that was able to boot to the point of drawing an animated 'android' logo on my screen, but it doesn't seem to actually boot past that.
[01:19] <robru> (so I know my screen, pandaboard, sd card, etc all seem to be working at least). now I just need to find a working image.
[01:20] <robru> bryce, oh, android just booted ;-)
[01:21] <bryce> robru, yeah 22M sounds like something broke in the builder.  Can't find the img I used but believe it was 700+ MB
[01:22] <bryce> yeah the 12.10 image is 726M - http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/12.10/release/
[01:25] <robru> LOL, android interface on a 24" monitor with a mouse is remarkably terrible -- keyboard not working, so I have to use a hilariously enormouse onscreen keyboard... and my mouse sensitivity is just pitiful.
[01:26] <desrt> robru: mouse sensitivity is gonna be low when normally the entire display is only a few hundred pixels wide
[01:27] <robru> desrt, yeah. this would be the best tablet ever if it was a touchscreen. but as is it's just awful
[01:27] <sarnold> nexus 4 screen is 1280x768, larger than some laptops / netbooks ...
[01:28] <desrt> sarnold: nexus 4 is a bit of an exception
[01:28] <desrt> it's got something like the nicest screen on earth, from the reviews i've read
[01:28] <sarnold> hehe
[01:28]  * desrt really wants google to fail at something that they try
[01:28] <sarnold> desrt: orkut? :)
[01:29] <desrt> i just hope it's not the broadband thing...
[01:29] <desrt> oh ya... and google plus isn't doing so hot either
[01:29] <sarnold> well, okay, orkut is going great in brazil last i heard. but still..
[01:29] <desrt> and buzz was a failure
[01:29] <desrt> as was wave
[01:29] <desrt> ya okay... google has failed at a lot
[01:29] <desrt> i'm happy
[01:30] <sarnold> and google tv died shortly after release as the major content owners decided they'd rather not let google play in their sandbox
[01:30] <desrt> didn't intel hit a similar roadbump very recently?
[01:30] <robru> desrt, ooh, I found a setting for pointer speed. excellent!
[01:31] <desrt> robru: try 11?
[01:33] <TheMuso> robru: You could always grab a netboot image for raring, and run the text installer and set up Ubuntu that way, thats how I usually do it.
[01:33] <TheMuso> Only caviot with that way is you have to install the proprietary omap4 display drivers.
[01:34] <TheMuso> The desktop image for pandaboard normally includes that driver, at least for raring.
[01:38] <bryce> robru, or install the quantal image and then try upgrading.
[01:44] <robru> bryce, ok, getting the quantal image now. Running android on a giant screen was fun though ;-)
[02:37] <robru> alright, 12.10 booted on the pandaboard, showed the loading splash, then the screen went black, but the indicators continue to flash. I assume it's just thinking slowly ;-)
[02:39] <TheMuso> robru: hard to say... What media did you install to?
[02:39] <robru> just booting off the SD card for the first time
[02:40] <robru> (took me a while to download it)
[02:41] <TheMuso> Ok, yeah it does take a while to come up.
[02:42] <TheMuso> I hope you are installing to a USB rotery disk.
[02:43] <sarnold> uhoh :) why>
[02:46] <robru> TheMuso, actually I do have a USB HDD that I'll be installing to
[02:47] <robru> TheMuso, do you know what it means if STATUS1 light blinks twice, then pauses?
[02:57] <TheMuso> robru: No I don't.
[03:17] <robru> TheMuso, according to http://omappedia.org/wiki/PandaBoard_FAQ#What_do_these_blinking_LEDs_on_PandaBoard_mean.3F it means, more or less, 'normal operation'. status2 indicates hd access and status1 by default just blinks twice per second.
[03:18] <sarnold> does the speed of the blinking seem to change over the course of booting to you guys too? I wondered if I was going nuts or not.. :)
[03:27] <TheMuso> It changes according to CPU load for me sometimes.
[03:27] <TheMuso> Or IO activity at least.
[03:28] <sarnold> since mine's in my bedroom, I turned off the lights :) but now I've got an interest in turning the heartbeat back on and trying putting it under cpu load..
[03:32] <robru> hmmm,  yeah, so I can't get this to boot. it showed the bootsplash, and I hit escape and it showed me a bunch of upstart stuff, then the screen powered down and hasn't come back since
[03:33] <TheMuso> I wonder if you don't have the proprietary omap4 driver installed.
[03:33] <TheMuso> s/don't//
[03:41] <bryce> robru, do you have the sd card still inserted?
[03:41] <robru> bryce, yep.
[03:42] <robru> TheMuso, nothing is "installed", I'm talking about a fresh boot off the quantal omap4 image. it shows the bootsplash then the screen powers down. no installation happens
[03:42] <sarnold> didn't till go through this? what was his solution...
[03:44] <TheMuso> robru: Yes but I mean installed onto the live image.

[06:06] <desrt> amoma: i don't think it's gnome-terminal that's doing that...
[06:14] <robru> desrt, amoma: actually, one time I accidentally cat'ed a binary file and gnome-terminal tried to interpret random data as unicode, and tried to install some weird fonts to display strange foreign unicode codepages... but I just hit 'cancel' and it cancelled...
[06:15] <desrt> robru: ya.  i've had that as well
[06:15] <desrt> but i think it's something inside of gtk or pango or something that detects that and spawns something offering to install it

[08:25] <amoma>  gnome terminal wants to install a font. How disable it?
[08:26] <amoma> any solutions?
[08:26] <amoma> yes it is during browsing by binary files in opened in terminal
[08:27] <amoma> it is highly useful to search binaries for strings
[08:28] <amoma> for example firefox trying to dns badware even if all config strings are replacet eg to 127
[08:29] <amoma> so searching where the 'badware' string is located resort to firefox.so
[08:30] <amoma> etc... i want this message to turn off. It is annoying
[08:31] <amoma> every 2 3 screean popp rando message, as Thai, Cherokee, Kilgons, Kanda...
[08:31] <amoma>  gnome terminal wants to install a font. How disable it?
[08:34] <amoma> of course instaling the fonts is not an option , instling the fonts will render binary file as some uni-codes, which will consist a serious nonsense

[10:14] <bochecha_> amoma: on Fedora there's a package to remove if you want to disable this: PackageKit-gtk3-module, maybe there is something similar on Ubuntu?
[10:15] <Laney> If you're talking about packagekit, I thought that the terminal was supposed to be blacklisted?

[10:19] <chrisccoulson> hi seb128 :)
[10:20] <seb128> chrisccoulson, hey, how are you?
[10:20] <chrisccoulson> seb128, yeah, not too bad thanks. how are you?
[10:20] <seb128> chrisccoulson, nautilus: not for me and I didn't see any report or mention of it
[10:22] <pitti> chrisccoulson: o/
[10:22] <pitti> chrisccoulson: it's been horribly slow for a while now for me
[10:22] <pitti> bonjour seb128
[10:22] <seb128> pitti, salut, ca va ?
[10:23] <pitti> ça va bien!
[10:23] <pitti> et toi?
[10:23] <seb128> chrisccoulson, pitti: is "maxing out cpu" while using it, or is it sitting there eating cpu for you?
[10:23] <seb128> pitti, ca va bien merci ;-)
[10:23] <chrisccoulson> pitti - ah, it's spinning the CPU on thumbnailing my wallpaper in my home directory
[10:23] <pitti> while using it mostly, and when opening a new window
[10:24] <chrisccoulson> if i switch to a directory without png's in it, it's fine
[10:24] <pitti> i. e. the window opens, then it takes ages to show contents
[10:24] <seb128> chrisccoulson, is that image changing?
[10:24] <chrisccoulson> seb128, no, the image is static
[10:24] <seb128> weird
[10:24] <chrisccoulson> it actually never finishes thumbnailing here
[10:24] <pitti> even for directories with very few thumbnails
[10:25] <pitti> my ~/src has 6 directories and two files, takes 5 seconds
[10:26] <jibel> nautilus even died here while browsing the pictures directory
[10:26] <chrisccoulson> seb128, this is the image it seems to fail on: http://people.canonical.com/~chrisccoulson/Nightly_wallpaper.png
[10:27] <seb128> chrisccoulson, pitti: did those issues start recently? I don't get any such bug here
[10:27] <seb128> chrisccoulson, pitti: nautilus didn't change for weeks though, I would tend to blame the new glib/gvfs
[10:28] <chrisccoulson> seb128, i'm not sure when it started for me. i only just noticed now that it's using a lot of cpu
[10:28] <pitti> seb128: I'm not quite sure when it started, I don't use nautilus that often; but certainly at least two weeks or so
[10:28] <seb128> chrisccoulson, nautilus thumbnails that file just fine for me
[10:28] <pitti> waay before new glib/gvfs
[10:28] <seb128> k, maybe it's a 64b issue
[10:28] <seb128> no such problem on my i386 install
[10:29] <pitti> I open ~/src, nautilus goes 100% for some 5 seconhds, and then quiet again
[10:29] <pitti> peut-être
[10:29] <seb128> how many items do you have in there?
[10:29] <pitti> seb128: pitti | my ~/src has 6 directories and two files, takes 5 seconds
[10:29] <seb128> urg, k
[10:29] <chrisccoulson> seb128, hmmm, it thumbnails it fine for me if i copy it to my desktop too
[10:30] <chrisccoulson> i wonder if it's another file in my home folder
[10:30] <seb128> chrisccoulson, usually .svg create such issues
[10:30] <seb128> do you have any of those?
[10:30] <seb128> well the most frequent case is having a .svg that librsvg struggles with
[10:34] <seb128> pitti, do you have images or files that needs thumbnailing in ~/src?
[10:34] <pitti> seb128: a .hs and a .py file, both of which are thumbnailed as text
[10:34] <pitti> let me try with a directory which just has subdirs
[10:35] <pitti> same, 5 seconds
[10:35] <seb128> hum, k
[10:35] <seb128> any chance you can run it under gdb, ctrl-C during those 5 seconds and get a bt?
[10:36] <pitti> currently stracing
[10:38] <pitti> whoa, it's reading a gazillion SVG files
[10:38] <seb128> located where?
[10:38] <pitti> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1565679/
[10:39] <pitti> that's what happens (only opens, not the parsing) when I attach strace to an already running/initialized nautilus and open ~/src
[10:39] <pitti> once I have a window open, I can change directories with no delay
[10:39] <pitti> but each new window takes 5 seconds again
[10:39] <pitti> chrisccoulson: ^ is that the same for you? i. e. does it really depend on the folder for you?
[10:40] <pitti> so not only it reads SVG icons for icons that it doesn't need to show in that folder, it's even reading the same files many times
[10:41] <seb128> pitti, reading those files don't seem to be the issue
[10:41] <seb128> you have a 5 seconds gap in between 2 files in that
[10:41] <seb128> log
[10:42] <pitti> hm right, line 113
[10:42] <pitti> although it's still wrong to re-read all those icons
[10:43] <pitti> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1565690/ is the full trace
[10:43] <pitti> I'm reading from the point of "11:37:27.496294"
[10:44] <pitti> lots of nautilus_directory_monitor_add_internal() calls
[10:45]  * pitti wonders where he got all those ~/.local/share/locale/ files from
[10:45] <pitti> oh, that would be jhbuild
[10:46] <pitti> moving away  doesn't help either
[10:46] <seb128> try gdb and bt during those 5 seconds
[10:46] <seb128> re-reading the icons seems buggy indeed
[10:46] <seb128> but it shouldn't account for that many seconds
[10:46] <seb128> those are small svg files, and the strace timestamps indicates it's not spending seconds going through
[10:49] <pitti> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1565704/ and http://paste.ubuntu.com/1565706/ are two different BTs during that 5 seconds
[10:49] <pitti> doesn't tell me much, though
[10:50] <larsu> haha, I just commented on a MR and launchpad cut off the *last* sentence with a "More..." link
[10:55] <seb128> pitti, ooooh
[10:56] <seb128> pitti, grep TEMPLATE ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs
[10:56] <pitti> XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR="$HOME/.local/share"
[10:56] <seb128> pitti, that's likely it
[10:57] <seb128> pitti, makes it point to ~/Templates
[10:57] <seb128> or an empty dir something
[10:57] <pitti> hm, how did it end up there? thanks!
[10:57] <seb128> yw
[10:57] <seb128> I hate that template feature
[10:57] <pitti> that explains why "new file" shows sooo much crap
[10:58] <seb128> the usual case is that users delete ~/Template and that nautilus fallbacks to the parent dir, e.g ~
[10:58] <seb128> which makes nautilus parse all your files to create an endless template menu
[10:58] <seb128> which takes ages and eat your cpu
[10:58] <seb128> you got a small version of that...
[10:58] <seb128> still weird that it landed on .local/share
[10:58] <pitti> wow! lightning fast again!
[10:58] <bochecha_> seb128: I thought when deleting a XDG folder, it was recreated next time the session opened?
[10:59]  * pitti hugs seb128
[10:59]  * seb128 hugs pitti
[10:59] <bochecha_> at least that's what I've always seen here
[11:00] <seb128> bochecha_, it might, but in between .config/user-dirs.dirs is updated to point to an existant dir, e.g the parent directory usually
[11:00] <seb128> with nothing changing it back on next login
[11:00] <bochecha_> :-/
[11:01] <seb128> we discussed that issue in the past
[11:01] <seb128> ideally we should make those dir impossible to delete and explain the users why
[11:01] <seb128> or turn off the fallback and just disable the feature when the pointed dir doesn't exist
[11:01] <bochecha_> well, not necessarily
[11:02] <bochecha_> there's a DESKTOP folder in there, if you make it impossible to delete, then people running GNOME Shell will wonder where there documents are disappearing :)
[11:02] <seb128> things is that users delete e.g ~/Music because they have their media files in ~/Multimedia or something
[11:02] <seb128> or photos
[11:02] <seb128> then softwares like rhythmbox or shotwell get very confused
[11:03] <bochecha_> well, they are pointing to XDG_MUSIC_DIR, not to ~/Music
[11:03] <bochecha_> what is missing is a way to reassign those variables to the preferred folders of the user
[11:03] <seb128> right, but no user knows to edit .config/user-dirs.dirs to point XDG_MUSIC_DIR to ~/Multimedia/zic
[11:04] <seb128> so they just get bitten by it
[11:04] <seb128> over and over
[11:04] <seb128> oh well, one day we will solve that
[11:04] <bochecha_> I actually always reassign XDG_DESKTOP_DIR to ~, I'm glad I never did the same with TEMPLATE ^_^
[11:04] <seb128> hehe

[11:27] <seb128> pitti, using an hook to do a symlink, e.g Desktop/firefox.desktop -> /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop?
[11:27] <pitti> seb128: create a .desktop file somewhere, and add it to unity/launchers.txt
[11:28] <pitti> seb128: oh, to the actual desktop, not the unity launcher
[11:28] <seb128> pitti, well, I don't want it on the launcher, I want it on the background (e.g in ~/Desktop)
[11:28] <pitti> seb128: second, phone
[11:28] <seb128> pitti, sure, no hurry
[11:49] <seb128> pitti, is there any way to add a gsettings schemas override there? or should I just add it in the debian dir and hack the rules to install it?
[11:50] <pitti> seb128: yes, you can still use the full power of debian/ to install additional files of course
[11:50] <pitti> debian/package.install, no need to hack rules :)
[11:50] <pitti> or debian/package.links for your .desktop above
[11:51] <seb128> pitti, I was going to add a debian/<source>.gsettings-override, but it's a bit weird since u-d-b already creates one for the launcher overrides
[11:51] <seb128> well I guess it's fine to have 2 overrides

[12:56] <seb128> chrisccoulson, I'm not sure to understand why the new glib creates a loop for nautilus thumbnailing, but I trust you if you say so ... going to backport that fix? ;-)
[12:56] <chrisccoulson> seb128, actually hold on a second
[12:56] <chrisccoulson> i still might be missing something yet :)
[12:56] <seb128> no hurry
[13:00] <chrisccoulson> basically, what is happening here is that glib says the thumbnail path is /home/chr1s/.cache/thumbnails/large/f030a33a884d2c13e4360c78ef5c04c0.png, but nautilus creates the thumbnail in /home/chr1s/.cache/thumbnails/normal/f030a33a884d2c13e4360c78ef5c04c0.png
[13:01] <chrisccoulson> so when it reads the wrong thumbnail and comares the mtime stored in the metadata, it thinks it's out of date, and then tries again
[13:01] <chrisccoulson> but i'm not sure why it's only for this image
[13:01] <chrisccoulson> and only in my home folder
[13:02] <seb128> weird indeed, maybe try asking #cosimoc on #nautilus on irc.gnome.org if he saw issues like that before
[13:04] <chrisccoulson> oh
[13:04] <chrisccoulson> glib returns that path merely because there is a thumbnail in /home/chr1s/.cache/thumbnails/large
[13:04] <chrisccoulson> so i wonder what put that there?
[13:05] <seb128> did you run a jhbuild version that might have created it?
[13:05] <chrisccoulson> no, i'm just using stock raring
[13:06] <chrisccoulson> -rw------- 1 chr1s chr1s 35482 Jan 11 04:16 f030a33a884d2c13e4360c78ef5c04c0.png
[13:06] <chrisccoulson> so, i guess i need to hunt down whatever is creating thumbnails in there :)
[13:07] <Mirv> mitya57: do you mean lacking themes? aren't themes mostly a KDE thing anyhow, and normal Qt applications look a bit basic?
[13:08] <seb128> chrisccoulson, well, is that an issue that you get high quality thumbnails? that shouldn't make nautilus gets crazy...
[13:08] <Mirv> (at least compared to gtk apps having ambience applied)
[13:08] <chrisccoulson> sure enough, moving that file out of the way fixes it and stops nautilus using lots of CPU
[13:08] <Mirv> mitya57: anyhow, I've most of all tested Qt Quick applications, not so much Qt Widgets apps
[13:09] <mitya57> Mirv: apps like Vlc or Virtualbox still need to look fine on any desktop...
[13:09] <mitya57> I guess they just have dropped Gtk2 themes support, but I would at least like to use "Fusion" theme
[13:09] <Mirv> mitya57: yes, similar to how they run on Qt4, but that also needs the apps to port to Qt5 - Qt4 will stay the default for 13.04 at least AFAIK
[13:11] <Mirv> I don't know if apps like Vlc or Virtualbox port themselves to Qt5 before eg. KDE starts using Qt5 more
[13:11] <Mirv> even though porting is quite easy (eg. http://www.kdab.com/porting-from-qt-4-to-qt-5/)
[13:12] <Mirv> and http://qt-project.org/wiki/Transition_from_Qt_4.x_to_Qt5 is even shorter list
[13:16] <mitya57> Mirv: I know that porting is easy, but most of my Qt code is PyQt, so I'll need to wait a little with that
[13:16] <mitya57> Mirv: btw, I've just discovered that qttools debian/watch does not work (and probably for some other components)
[13:18] <mitya57> you may want to apply something like http://paste.ubuntu.com/1566016/
[13:18] <Mirv> mitya57: ah, good catch, I can at least mark that down. the lintian exception would also need updating for others than qtbase
[13:19] <Mirv> thanks
[13:20] <Mirv> I've now been packaging first snapshots of some non-core modules like qtsensors
[13:21] <Mirv> but those I haven't yet committed towards Debian at all (not sure if they'd be interested in them before there are releases)
[13:23] <mitya57> Mirv: to sum up: thanks for your work on qt5 packages! and feel free to ping me if you become interested in the desktop integration.
[13:25] <Mirv> mitya57: no problem :) 99% of the packaging is aimed to be done in Debian, so contributions are most welcome there if they just aren't Kubuntu/Ubuntu specific
[13:25] <Mirv> http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/ -> pkg-kde/qt/*
[13:26] <mitya57> yes, I know, I built my packages from that repos :)
[13:26] <Mirv> but you're right in that currently I'm not looking directly at desktop applications, because it's not yet happening for most part
[13:26] <Mirv> cool :)
[13:26] <mitya57> I'll be maybe interested in mobile ui if PyQt is available there
[13:27] <Mirv> I joined Debian's pkg-kde because of this effort, it's pretty nice in there
[13:27] <Mirv> yeah let's see what becomes of PyQt & PySide (I'm not up-to-date at all)
[13:28] <mitya57> I'll wait for their next release which added support for 5.0.0 final, and play with that to see if it's possible to use our ui-toolkit in pyqt

[17:12] <Sweetshark> lol? https://github.com/search?p=6&q=path%3A.ssh%2Fid_rsa
[17:15] <mpt> mterry, I'm trying your update-manager branch. There's a list branch for "Firefox Web Browser", but firefox-locale-ar and firefox-locale-en are outside that branch. Do you know why that might be?
[17:16] <mterry> mpt, ah...  I bet because firefox doesn't depend on them.  I imagine the language pack does?
[17:16] <mterry> mpt, it *might* suggest them.  But doubtful
[17:16] <desrt> mterry: hey... how's the file picker coming along?
[17:17] <mterry> desrt, I haven't done much work on it, it might get postponed a cycle because of mobile focus
[17:17] <mterry> mpt, "reverse-depends firefox-locale-ar" shows language-pack-ar-base
[17:18] <mpt> mterry, huh, it seems like the language packs themselves don't have any dependencies at all!
[17:18] <mterry> mpt, firefox-locale-en doesn't have any no
[17:19] <mterry> mpt, but language-pack-ar-base does
[17:20] <mpt> mterry, that seems ... fragile. Dependency via replacement.
[17:20] <mterry> mpt, ?  does it?  Maybe I've misrepresented something
[17:21] <mterry> language-pack-ar -> language-pack-ar-base -> firefox-locale-ar
[17:21] <mpt> mterry, no, I mean, strange packaging. Not strange Software Updater behavior.
[17:21] <mterry> Yar, but there's no replacement happening
[17:29] <Sweetshark> seb128: package updated on people.canonical.com
[17:30] <Sweetshark> (and on chinstrap)
[17:30] <mpt> mterry, overall this looks splendid. Were you able to test any package with XB-Restart-Required set?
[17:31] <mterry> mpt, only by faking it.  It's not 100% done.  The icon appears on left, but the string doesn't appear on bottom.  I'll fix that later with a separate branch.  Plus, we need to get some packages to use it
[17:31] <mpt> sure :-)
[17:32] <mterry> mpt, awesome.  Well, I guess I'll push it into trunk/distro then!  :)
[17:33] <mterry> mpt, on my blog post about it, there were quite a few comments about not showing the package name anymore
[17:33] <mterry> mpt, (note that I added it in the changelog section though)
[17:34] <mterry> mpt, but I think it looks fine, the only bummer is when there are identical labels.  But those are arguably package bugs.  The debian policy says the label should make sense even without seeing the package name
[17:34] <mpt> mterry, yes. Containers get blamed for their contents. Notify OSD got blamed for bad notification text, Ubuntu Software Center got blamed for bad package descriptions, now Software Updater is being blamed for bad labels.
[17:34] <mterry> :)
[17:35] <seb128> Sweetshark, thanks
[17:38] <mterry> mpt, what wasn't working with the tri-state checkboxes?  I didn't notice a problem in my quick testing
[17:40] <mpt> mterry, unfortunately I specified it in detail only in private e-mail to dylanmccall :-)
[17:40] <mterry> mpt, ah  :)
[17:40] <mpt> mterry, basically that when a parent checkbox is in the indeterminate state, clicking it three times should return it to the indeterminate state.
[17:40] <mpt> It's a cycle: indeterminate -> checked -> unchecked -> indeterminate
[17:41] <mterry> mpt, ah interesting.  Sure.  OK, good.  as long as I'm not going to be pushing a bug, just a lack of feature
[17:42] <seb128> hum
[17:42] <seb128> desrt, pitti: do you see where/why that build is failing https://launchpadlibrarian.net/129298794/buildlog_ubuntu-raring-amd64.glib2.0_2.35.4-1~ppa2_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz ?
[17:43] <desrt> pbuilder using a line of ****** as separators makes it kinda hard to search for make errors :)
[17:45] <desrt> hmm
[17:45] <desrt> GLib:ERROR:/build/buildd/glib2.0-2.35.4/./glib/tests/gwakeuptest.c:107:context_clear: assertion failed: (ctx->pending_tokens == NULL)
[17:45] <desrt> this has my name written all over it :(
[17:45] <desrt> seb128: did you try resubmitting the build?
[17:45] <desrt> nothing changed in this area recently so i think you probably found a very thin race
[17:45] <seb128> desrt, yes
[17:45] <desrt> did it work?
[17:45] <seb128> that's the second failure in a row
[17:45] <desrt> ohhh
[17:46] <desrt> weird!
[17:46] <desrt> anything change about the builders recently, like kernel or something?
[17:46] <seb128> well, I'm backporting some commits over 2.35.4
[17:46] <desrt> hmm
[17:46] <desrt> seb128: is this the first 2.35 you've taken?
[17:46] <seb128> desrt, well, 2.35.4 built
[17:47] <seb128> so either something changed in distro
[17:47] <seb128> or it's one of my 4 backports
[17:47] <desrt> so this is a result of your backports
[17:47] <desrt> huh
[17:47] <desrt> i guess you didn't take anything related
[17:47] <desrt> gwakeup hasn't had anyone touching it since last year...
[17:47] <desrt> nor has the testcase
[17:48] <desrt> what commits did you pick?
[17:48] <seb128> http://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/commit/?id=f24594122c3e3c66702ff537d3468ed251838007
[17:48] <seb128> http://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/commit/?id=e908b50371a5052d7a9690b3409ae028d46540b4
[17:48] <seb128> http://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/commit/?id=b0d5ce16782cc06712456ffa6b8a7521a70bcd1e
[17:48] <seb128> and I reverted
[17:48] <seb128> http://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/commit/?id=5eba9784979e0b723c05a45cf767046607e4e759
[17:48] <desrt> so uh
[17:48] <desrt> 3 of those are in gio and the other is about timezones
[17:48] <seb128> since it's buggy and I care less about btrfs optimization atm than about nautilus segfaulting
[17:48] <desrt> resubmit the unpatched glib and see if it fails
[17:48] <seb128> ok
[17:49] <desrt> could easily be caused by a new kernel
[17:49] <mpt> mterry, have you reported bugs for XB-Restart-Required? If not, should I report ones for linux and glib at least?
[17:50] <desrt> doesn't mean it's still not my fault, of course...
[17:50] <mterry> mpt, I haven't started that yet, no
[17:50] <mterry> mpt, sure.  glibc or glib?
[17:50] <mpt> glibc
[17:50] <mterry> mpt, yeah, linux and glibc make sense
[17:51] <mterry> mpt, linux-meta is the source I believe
[17:51] <mpt> ta
[17:52] <mpt> mterry, <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux> has 3869 open bug reports, <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta> has 5...
[17:52] <mterry> mpt, well...  linux-meta is *a* source.  But the restart is probably actually triggered by the specific linux sources
[17:52] <lifeless> mpt: oh hi, I'm up early enough to chat :)
[17:52] <mterry> mpt, linux-meta makes the generic packages like linux-image
[17:52] <lifeless> mpt: is there some way (even if its just planned) to get rid of the 'reboot required' dialog without killing the proces by hand ?
[17:53] <mpt> lifeless, 6:52am?
[17:53] <lifeless> mpt: yeah, had to drop Lynne at the airport at 5am
[17:53] <lifeless> mpt: which is a totally antisocial hour.
[17:54] <mterry> mpt, but linux is a better source to file agains in this case I agree
[17:54] <mpt> lifeless, this page is sitting immediately to the left of my PC right now: https://launchpadlibrarian.net/128716123/p11.jpg
[17:54] <mpt> I just haven't finished speccing it yet
[17:55] <desrt> seb128: there may be a small issue in the test
[17:56] <lifeless> mpt: cool
[17:56] <desrt> seb128: the entire testcase depends on going to sleep on a GWakeup waiting for the test to finish and waking up when the poll returns
[17:57] <desrt> seb128: we don't check for EINTR returned from the poll, so it's possible that if someone delivers a signal to the process while the test is running we could wake up early and fail
[17:57] <desrt> could be something as innocent as a window size change
[17:58] <desrt> alternatively, though, i notice that we do alarm(60) for this test... maybe the SIGALRM is getting delivered because we hit the time limit
[17:58] <seb128> desrt, seems not likely on a builder though
[17:58] <desrt> hard to imagine a test that takes <1s on my laptop would take over a minute on a builder, though?
[17:59] <seb128> I doubt as well
[17:59] <desrt> plus.. that would cause it to fail like
[17:59] <desrt> /gwakeup/threaded: Alarm clock
[17:59] <desrt> not the assert we see
[17:59] <seb128> the full build is around 30min, and glib is built 3 times
[18:00] <desrt> so i'm left with two theories: the kernel changed and somehow eventfd no longer works the same as it used to
[18:00] <desrt> -or- we're getting some weird signal delivered causing poll() to return -1 (EINTR)
[18:02] <seb128> desrt, let's see if the previous version fails the same way
[18:03] <desrt> i sure hope so
[18:03] <seb128> bah, it built on i386 (the new version which failed twice on amd64)
[18:03] <seb128> could be a race...
[18:03] <seb128> Laney, pitti: ^ did you run into any glib testsuite issue when updated to 2.35.4?
[18:03] <Laney> no failures here

[18:35] <rvr_> jdstrand: Hey!
[18:35] <rvr_> One question
[18:35] <rvr_> We are pushing for an update of the firefox extension
[18:36] <rvr_> Is it safe to assume that it will be used by the last version of Firefox available in security/updates repositories?
[18:37] <rvr_> I wonder what's your policy regarding updates in this cases
[18:37] <jdstrand> rvr_: target 18.0.1. there are no plans for another firefox release before firefox 19 comes out
[18:38] <desrt> ogra_: i don't... i'm just kinda surprised to see this issue so quickly wontfixed instead of trying to figure out what's wrong
[18:38] <rvr_> jdstrand: Yeah, I mean... the 12.10 comes with Firefox 16 by default
[18:39] <rvr_> jdstrand: But any update using security and/or update repositories will upgrade users to Firefox 18
[18:39] <jdstrand> rvr_: right, but almost no one will use that. they will follow -security/-updates and have 18.0.1. do keep in mind that upstream releases every 6 weeks or so, so 19 is around the corner
[18:39] <rvr_> Should be test against Firefox 16?
[18:39] <rvr_> Ok
[18:39] <rvr_> Thanks
[18:40] <jdstrand> rvr_: I wouldn't bother. people won't get your update to the exension without getting ff18.0.1

[19:27] <bizhan_> HI I got this information from a one of our developers, I was wondering if this is a correct statement about ubuntu: "booting into a console-only environment is not possible  will require to boot into Desktop first and then kill the desktop manager to get into console-only mode" ? Thx
[19:29] <sarnold> bizhan_: server installs don't do X, and even if you did a desktop install and want to avoid X, that too is very easy: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#override-files
[19:30] <bizhan_> sarnold: Thanks very much for this info.
[19:32] <doomlord> how much is involved in adding a custom thumbnailer for the linux filebrowser
[19:32] <doomlord> an itch i'd like to scratch is some 3d file formats being thumbnailed (.obj..)
[19:34] <doomlord> presumeably there's some place where you can register file type plugins

[21:44] <seb128> qengho, try #ubuntu-unity or ping didrocks tomorrow
[22:39] <Trevinho> seb128: I'll try to ping again vuntz if it is needed...
[22:39] <Trevinho> seb128: also he was ok to give us more power on libwnck as we're the only still using it (with xfce)
[22:40] <seb128> Trevinho, well, if you are confident about the patches we should get those in
=== m_conley is now known as m_conley_away
[22:40] <seb128> it got delayed because I was travelling last week and sort of waiting for them to be in git since you said vuntz was going to commit
[22:40] <Trevinho> seb128: I am
[22:40] <seb128> ok, great, I will get them in tomorrow or monday, still ping vuntz if you can, thanks ;-)
[22:41] <Trevinho> seb128: ok
[22:43] <seb128> 'night
