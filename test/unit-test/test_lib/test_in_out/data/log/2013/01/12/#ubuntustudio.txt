[02:42] <LaRueGT> whoa
[02:43] <LaRueGT> try hooking up "aubionotes" to your mike and the midi out into a synth plugin
[02:43] <LaRueGT> it fires off notes by the tone of your voice!
[04:17] <LaRueGT> is there a virtual midi keyboard with a midi-in that will show on the keys which notes are being received?
[04:19] <len-1304> I think Yoshimi can show a keyboard which will do that.
[04:19] <len-1304> Yoshimi is a soft synth, but it has it's own KB too.
[04:20] <LaRueGT> yeah it isnt visualizing the incoming notes
[04:21] <len-1304> You have to connect up the incoming midi port... using a2j I would guess.
[04:21] <len-1304> That may not be the one I was thinking of.
[04:21] <LaRueGT> its connected, the midi is making sound come out of it, it just isnt showing me what notes it is receiving
[04:22] <LaRueGT> im making a little script that spits out midi and im trying to find a nice way to test if its working
[04:23] <len-1304> qmidiroute will show you the notes in text.
[04:23] <LaRueGT> lovely
[04:23] <len-1304> In the event log window.
[04:26] <LaRueGT> found one
[04:26] <len-1304> good
[04:26] <LaRueGT> bristol does it
[04:27] <LaRueGT> though it is kinds crashy
[04:27] <len-1304> Ah, I don't have that one.
[04:31] <LaRueGT> its kind od sweet, it emulates a bunch of different vintage synth's the prophet 10 can make some sweet nast bass
[04:31] <LaRueGT> err, nasty
[04:31] <LaRueGT> man im excited, this is gonna work
[04:32] <LaRueGT> so I hum into my mike, aubionotes spits midi out corresponding to the note im humming, bristol shows me what key that note is. So finally, I can fin the notes im looking for and get the melodies out of my head and into the computer
[04:34] <LaRueGT> I figure I keep doing this long enough and ill be able to find them on my own
[04:34] <LaRueGT> but until then, this handy little toy will keep me from getting frustrated and giving up
[04:53] <len-1304> Sounds great... I may try it.
[04:53] <len-1304> I tend to go chords first and melody from there.
[04:59] <LaRueGT> yeah I cant figure out how to hum chords
[04:59] <LaRueGT> otherwise it'd be tempting
[05:00] <LaRueGT> im thinking the best crutch I could do chord wise would be like a panel full of buttons, you pick the root note and then your bank of buttons gives you all the chords you can do from it, and you just plod your way through those until you find the one you were looking for
[05:01] <LaRueGT> do you know of any software like that, a chord picker menu of some sort?
[05:01] <len-1304> Not really, though LMMS and Gorgan do some things sort of like that.
[05:02] <LaRueGT> I guess you could further narrow down the possible chords you are looking for by also telling it what key the song was in
[05:02] <len-1304> yes.
[05:02] <len-1304> in C A is minor
[05:02] <LaRueGT> ive never heard of Gorgan
[05:03] <len-1304> It is meant as G-organ
[05:03] <len-1304> it is in the ubuntu repos though
[05:03] <len-1304> I am not sure if the G is GTK, Gnome, or general midi.
[05:05] <LaRueGT> there are windows tools like harmony navigator and harmony improvisator, im unnaware of any linux equivalents though, and they do this fancy suggestion of chord progression thing which is probably too much of a crutch even for me
[05:06] <LaRueGT> hmm im finding genpo and gmorgan, but not gorgan
[05:09] <LaRueGT> ah, it looks like its gmorgan
[07:27] <LaRueGT> these calf plugins are friggin awesome
[18:13] <jayhosh> Anybody have any experience with firewire connections in Ubuntustudio?
[20:08] <zlatko> i'm trying to get sound of my guitar using qJackCtl+guitarix. Jack will not start properly and gives me error messages. Can anybody help?
[20:09] <zlatko> Setting PulseAudio Mixer [enabling: instrument] I am now getting clean sound of my guitar using external USB [Line6 UX1] sound card.
[20:10] <zlatko> But Jack is making problem still...
[20:13] <len-1304> which version of OS are you using?
[20:13] <zlatko> latest fresh install of Ubuntu Studio
[20:13] <len-1304> 12.10?
[20:13] <zlatko> yes
[20:14] <zlatko> [done all updates]
[20:14] <len-1304> in qjackctl setup, there is a second tab
[20:14] <zlatko> Options?
[20:14] <len-1304> Ya, enable the first script:
[20:14] <len-1304> Execute script on startup
[20:15] <len-1304> And add pasuspender sleep 1 &
[20:15] <len-1304> Then save
[20:15] <len-1304> It will probably not work just yet
[20:15] <zlatko> Yes, but which script? Dropdown is empty...
[20:15] <len-1304>  pasuspender sleep 1 &
[20:16] <len-1304> Exactly that text
[20:16] <len-1304> Then save
[20:16] <len-1304> Before it will work you have to restart jackdbus (which is still running
[20:17] <len-1304> open a terminal and type jack_control exit
[20:17] <zlatko> done
[20:17] <len-1304> Then you should be able to start Jack with qjackctl
[20:18] <zlatko> I hope I saved script by clicking OK
[20:18] <len-1304> Should do
[20:18] <zlatko> There was no Save or Apply option on the window
[20:18] <len-1304> Ya, OK is it.
[20:18] <len-1304> Have you done the jack_control exit?
[20:19] <zlatko> yes and restarted
[20:19] <len-1304> (or logout and in)
[20:19] <zlatko> and got D-BUS: JACK server could not be started.
[20:19] <zlatko> oh I did not logout
[20:19] <len-1304> Do you have the right device selected?
[20:20] <zlatko> should I first logout. Yes I think I have right device... I guess
[20:20] <len-1304> If you did the jack_control exit you shouldn't have to
[20:21] <len-1304> You may have to restart qjackctl though
[20:21] <zlatko> let me logout login just for case...
[20:21] <len-1304> OK
[20:24] <zlatko> I logged in again
[20:24] <len-1304> OK
[20:25] <zlatko> should I start qJack first?
[20:25] <len-1304> Yes
[20:25] <zlatko> (qjackctl.real:10804): Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_widget_get_direction: assertion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed
[20:25] <len-1304> Don't worry about those for now.
[20:25] <zlatko> ok
[20:26] <len-1304> I am not sure what they are but they don't seem to keep jack from running
[20:26] <zlatko> Should we check do I have correct sound card in setup?
[20:26] <len-1304> Sure
[20:26] <len-1304> Right side called interface
[20:26] <zlatko> So I have 2 options Line 6 blah blah 0 and 0,0
[20:27] <zlatko> for Input device and Output device
[20:27] <len-1304> Just use the top one
[20:27] <zlatko> ok
[20:27] <len-1304> there is a > at the very right
[20:27] <len-1304> click on that and you should see a list of your devices
[20:28] <zlatko> so its hw:0 for both input & output
[20:28] <zlatko> exactly
[20:28] <zlatko> as you said
[20:28] <len-1304> Sample rate?
[20:29] <zlatko> 44100
[20:29] <len-1304> OK, Frames/period?
[20:29] <zlatko> 1024
[20:30] <len-1304> Good place to start, but you will want to go to 256 or lower after you get things working.
[20:30] <zlatko> realtime checked other things are unchecked
[20:30] <len-1304> Should be able to get to 128 on just about any card
[20:30] <len-1304> Yup
[20:30] <zlatko> yeah 256 would be nice...
[20:30] <zlatko> later
[20:30] <len-1304> I guess OK it
[20:31] <zlatko> OK
[20:31] <len-1304> Try start again
[20:32] <zlatko> no red text in message output
[20:32] <zlatko> it seems it's running!
[20:32] <zlatko> New client 'qjackctl' with PID 10804
[20:32] <len-1304> So now you can start guitarix
[20:33] <zlatko> yes I started [no errors reported]
[20:33] <zlatko> Connecting 'gx_head_amp:out_0' to 'gx_head_fx:in_0'
[20:33] <len-1304> OK, in the connections .... you seem to be ahead of what I can type :)
[20:34] <len-1304> There is a connections window in qjackctl
[20:34] <zlatko> ok got it
[20:34] <len-1304> Sort of a red crossover picture
[20:34] <zlatko> here it is
[20:35] <zlatko> yeah that's still confusing concept for me
[20:35] <zlatko> to connect it right...
[20:35] <len-1304> you want to make a connection from system capture-1
[20:35] <len-1304> Assuming that is your guitar
[20:35] <zlatko> OK
[20:35] <zlatko> I think it is
[20:36] <len-1304> to gx_head_amp in_0
[20:36] <zlatko> done - green line connected two things
[20:36] <len-1304> Then from gx_head_fx to system
[20:36] <len-1304> playback
[20:38] <zlatko> yes! it works. I even went one step further head to fx distortion to system
[20:38] <zlatko> all clear man!
[20:39] <zlatko> so the concept is: capture to gx-head to effect 1, 2, 3... and finally to system playback
[20:39] <zlatko> correct?
[20:41] <len-1304> Something like that.
[20:41] <len-1304> If you go to the engine menu, there is latency there
[20:42] <len-1304> try 128
[20:42] <zlatko> should I stop or exit jack before setting  lower latency
[20:42] <len-1304> It seems to work on the fly.
[20:42] <len-1304> If it doen't then stop and restart
[20:43] <zlatko> so Setup button on QJack
[20:43] <len-1304> (if it doesn't it may crash :)
[20:43] <zlatko> Server settings will be only effective after
[20:43] <zlatko> restarting the JACK audio server.
[20:43] <zlatko> but it did not crash
[20:44] <len-1304> ok
[20:45] <len-1304> SO are you set now?
[20:46] <zlatko> len - thank you so much. one more thing pls: I guess it is still impossible in Ubuntu Studio to let the music play trough Audiacous and play guitar using Jack+effect over it?
[20:46] <len-1304> should work
[20:47] <holstein> with JACK, you can route what you like to what you like
[20:47] <holstein> should have always been possible
[20:47] <len-1304> in the qjackctl connections window you should have seen
[20:47] <len-1304> pulse audio with some lines already connected
[20:47] <holstein> i find audacious doesnt throw out jack outputs til its playing a file
[20:48] <holstein> or, you could do the pulseaudio thing i suppose.. but i usually disable that for performance and use audacious via JACK
[20:48] <len-1304> Pulse should already be connected to jack, just start it and it should play
[20:48] <len-1304> you may in pulse have to tell it to use jack sink
[20:49] <len-1304> To get the pulse mixer, click on the speaker in the top bar and select sound settings
[20:49] <zlatko> ok
[20:50] <zlatko> I can see audiacious on playback tab
[20:50] <len-1304> There is a port assignment
[20:50] <len-1304> It may say analog output or something
[20:50] <zlatko> [but the song is not playing; it's on 0:00 still]
[20:50] <len-1304> click on that
[20:50] <len-1304> And see if there is a jack sink
[20:51] <holstein> i would troubleshoot the song playing seperately
[20:51] <holstein> could be a codec issue or anything
[20:51] <holstein> choose a known good audio file and play it without jack in a player you are familiar with
[20:51] <len-1304> He was doing it straight to device before
[20:51] <holstein> then you arent troubleshooting several things at once
[20:52] <len-1304> zlatko, Is there a box right next to the word audasious that has your card type in it?
[20:53] <zlatko> no sorry I was searching
[20:53] <zlatko> all tabs and no thing link Jack Sink found
[20:53] <len-1304> look in the output devices
[20:53] <len-1304> Do you see two devices?
[20:54] <zlatko> only thing in output I can change is what to "Show"
[20:54] <zlatko> I can see just UX1 Analog Stereo
[20:54] <len-1304> What happens when you click on that?
[20:55] <zlatko> All output devices
[20:55] <zlatko> then Hardver out* devices
[20:55] <zlatko> & virtual output devices
[20:55] <len-1304> Ya that is not the tab I meant
[20:55] <len-1304> All output devices should show jacksink
[20:55] <zlatko> This is volume control?
[20:55] <len-1304> Yes
[20:56] <len-1304> In a terminal type pulseaudio -k
[20:56] <len-1304> that will restart pulse
[20:56] <zlatko> done
[20:57] <len-1304> Volume control will blank and reconnect
[20:57] <len-1304> what output devices do you have now?
[20:57] <zlatko> now in QJack I can see PulseAudio Jack Sink
[20:57] <len-1304> click the green check
[20:58] <len-1304> You may have to restart audacious
[20:58] <zlatko> Jack Sink should be checked or unchecked, sorry
[20:58] <zlatko> ?
[20:58] <len-1304> checked.
[20:59] <zlatko> ok (clicked down button)
[20:59] <len-1304> In playback audacious may have gone away
[20:59] <zlatko> ALL WORKS
[20:59] <len-1304> Great!
[20:59] <zlatko> Len, you're genius...
[21:00] <zlatko> I will save this log!
[21:00] <len-1304> Normally you shouldn't have to restart pulse, not sure what happened
[21:00] <zlatko> Not to bother you guys if I mess things...
[21:00] <len-1304> We all had to learn
[21:00] <len-1304> Happy to share what I know
[21:01] <zlatko> Thanks [my wife got crazy... I am checking out. I will be happy to see you again on the #]!
[21:01] <Len-nb> See you later I have to go too
[21:59] <marcel_> hi people, i'm new to ubuntu studio. I got a sound problem. I only hear sound in some programs if i set its output settings to "jack". But I never hear any system-sounds, because it seems to use pulse mixer. May anybody help me with finding the right settings?
[22:01] <holstein> marcel_: pulse should be routed to JACK
[22:01] <holstein> marcel_: if i didnt need jack i woudnt run it
[22:01] <holstein> marcel_: do you need JACK and system sounds?
[22:04] <marcel_> I didnt hear any sounds since i set up the new operating system. I tried to find the problem on my own. And I only get sounds if i switch output to "jack" in "audacious" for example.
[22:04] <holstein> marcel_: what sounds are you expecting?
[22:07] <marcel_> if i start a mp3-file in audacious I expect to hear it if volume is turnt up. If I choose "ALSA" or "PulseAudio" there is no sound. If I choose "Jack" its running.
[22:08] <marcel_> I got now sounds in webbrowser and searched for its sound output setting.. I think its using pulse because i cant hear anything
[22:08] <zequence> marcel_: jack needs to be started first, in order to use it as sound server
[22:08] <marcel_> please correct me, if im not right
[22:08] <zequence> You can use qjackctl to control jack
[22:09] <zequence> marcel_: jack is not for desktop sound
[22:09] <zequence> marcel_: pulseaudio is the desktop audio server
[22:10] <zequence> marcel_: What kind of audio device do you have?
[22:10] <marcel_> okay, i understood. but in this case my desktop audio server isn't working
[22:10] <marcel_> device name is "hda_Intel"
[22:11] <marcel_> in alsamixer
[22:11] <zequence> alsamixer is not needed in this case, as pulseaudio can control your device fully
[22:11] <marcel_> or does ubuntu.studio start jack audio driver on startup automatically? and i need to close it?
[22:11] <zequence> use the pulseaudio mixer. in the volume applet
[22:11] <zequence> marcel_: no
[22:12] <zequence> marcel_: You need to make sure pulseaudio is using the right output
[22:13] <zequence> marcel_: Is it a PC, or a laptop? PC's have front and back, usually.
[22:13] <marcel_> im using pulse audio in volume applet. typed "alsamixer" in terminal to find out device's name
[22:13] <marcel_> im using a laptop
[22:16] <marcel_> okay
[22:16] <zequence> marcel_: In the pulseaudio mixer, in output, you should see something like "builtin Audio". And probably, you only have one device, since you're using a laptop
[22:16] <marcel_> its running
[22:16] <marcel_> i chose another output channel in pulse settings
[22:16] <zequence> Sometimes the default is wrong, yes :)
[22:16] <zequence> have fun with your new OS
[22:16] <marcel_> their are 4 diffrent channels i can choose but they are all named the same
[22:18] <marcel_> thank you very much. with your help it took minutes, i was searching for about an hour xP
[22:19] <marcel_> i need jack if i want to use midi-input-devices with low latency, am i right?
