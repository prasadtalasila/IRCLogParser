[02:13] <snap-l> Man, Elite Keyboards is sloooooow.
[02:13]  * snap-l wishes they sold via Amazon Prime.
[04:25] <snap-l> greg-g: You're not going to believe this.
[04:25] <snap-l> Remember tha band I posted about yesterday re: being bummed the album wasn't released under a CC license?
[04:26] <snap-l> Guess who just got done writing them about the CC license because they wanted to know more?
[05:10] <greg-g> snap-l: nice! good luck ;)
[10:35] <Wolfger> CC:FTW
[11:33] <snap-l> i'll be surprised if anything comes of it, but it's better than nothing.
[11:47] <snap-l> https://www.dndclassics.com
[11:47] <snap-l> Looks like a soft launch of titles, but yay nonetheless.
[12:26] <rick_h_> freaking brrrrr
[13:18] <rick_h_> ok, who can point me to something that explains wtf "request annotation" is as it concerns web app controllers?
[13:18] <rick_h_> jrwren: widox Blazeix ^ ?
[13:37] <snap-l> rick_h_: I'm seeing a lot of Spring stuff associated with that.
[13:39] <rick_h_> yea, my google fu is coming up with a bunch of stuff, but nothing jumping out that says why someone would file that bug against our code
[13:39] <widox> rick_h_: can't say that I've heard of it
[13:40] <widox> some annotation that specifies a uri that matches a controller method?
[13:40] <snap-l> Seems an awful roundabout way of putting it
[13:41] <rick_h_> so this is in the context of our db connection to use for the request
[13:46] <widox> hm, I dunno about that
[13:49] <rick_h_> ok, I found the guy and bugged him about it
[13:49] <rick_h_> basically he wants to have request.db vs from app.models import getdb; getdb()
[13:50] <rick_h_> so by request annotation he means custom property on the request object itself in the view
[13:53] <snap-l> Why didn't he just say so?
[13:53] <snap-l> ;)
[14:02] <snap-l> n0p: http://www.indiegogo.com/protestthehero
[14:10] <jrwren> rick_h_: does not sound familiar
[14:10] <jrwren> rick_h_: unless that is a general term for that http form work around for http verb replacement
[14:11] <rick_h_> jrwren: yea, he meant s/request annotation/request property for us normal folks
=== jon_e is now known as JonEdney
[14:37] <Blazeix> weird way of putting it. i usually s/annotation/decorator/ to translate from java-ese to python-ese
[14:38] <n0p> snap-l: awesome, thanks
[14:56] <jjesse> whose excited to have a sewer guy cleaning out his drain today?  (not this guy)
[14:57] <_stink_> hopefully it will allow you to flush, though
[14:57] <jjesse> yeah
[14:57] <jjesse> and not flood the basement
[14:58] <rick_h_> there's liquid water out there today?
[14:59] <jjesse> in my basement there was
[15:05] <_stink_> ew
[15:47] <snap-l> Ugh
[16:21] <brousch> greg-g: Does this description of your talk seem accurate? http://www.meetup.com/grwebdev/events/44262322/
[16:21] <snap-l> Buh... buh...
[16:22] <snap-l> Remote Greg?
[16:23] <greg-g> brousch: sure thing
[16:23]  * greg-g still needs to make it ;)
[16:23] <brousch> :P
[16:25] <brousch> Three of us organize the group together. For each meeting, on of us is the "Manager Of Meeting." That is not me this time, so you might get contacted by Ross Hunter
[16:25] <greg-g> ok
[16:26] <brousch> But I'll be there and helping, so feel free to go through me
[16:27] <greg-g> gotcha
[16:27] <brousch> Thanks again
[16:28] <greg-g> np
[17:41] <brousch> Interesting http://detroitdevdays.com/mobidevday/
[18:28] <rick_h_> yea, didn't someone go to that last year? Blazeix maybe
[18:30] <brousch> This says it's a new conference. Mobile only
[18:30] <rick_h_> I thought they did a mobile thing before :/
[18:30] <brousch> Or a mobile-only version of the regular one
[18:30] <brousch> Apparently they had a mobile track last year
[18:31] <rick_h_> http://mobidevday2012.eventbrite.com/
[18:33] <brousch> I submitted my Kivy talk
[18:33] <rick_h_> cool
[18:33] <greg-g> I'm able to view that site with my desktop browser just fine!
[18:34] <brousch> :P
[18:36] <snap-l> Mobile is just a fad
[18:36] <snap-l> pretty soon they'll all come back to the nice desktop like good little kids.
[18:37]  * snap-l imagines something similar being said around the PC / Mainframe era
[18:41] <rick_h_> ok, I'm wearing a cap inside my house. Maybe I'd better go get the space heater :(
[18:42] <snap-l> hah
[18:42] <brousch> hipster!
[18:42] <rick_h_> hey, this bald heat is a giant heat sink and it works too well!
[18:42] <rick_h_> /heat/head
[18:43] <brousch> Grow more hair on your face to compensate
[18:43] <greg-g> +1
[18:47] <rick_h_> I think you need to retake thermal from school :P
[18:47] <rick_h_> thermo that is
[18:47] <rick_h_> greg-g: <3 the tool check
[18:47] <rick_h_> floored it's mitered vs dovetailed
[18:48] <rick_h_> if you need to fix a few nails: http://www.leevalley.com/US/hardware/page.aspx?p=40387&cat=3,41306,41324 should hopefully match up
[18:50] <greg-g> rick_h_: floored in which way? :)
[18:50] <rick_h_> greg-g: well since these things take a lot of abuse, normally they'd be dovetailed for strongest joints in the body
[18:50] <rick_h_> mitered doesn't give a lot of strength
[18:50] <rick_h_> unless mitered dovetailed, so floored the nails held it together that well
[18:51] <greg-g> ah, right :)
[19:13] <greg-g> rick_h_: when you have time to answer (no rush, obviously), do you have suggestions on care for the toolbox? I mean, I would love to not treat it like a museum peice. It is rugged still and not likely to break anywhere, but keeping it going tips would be helpful ;) (oils? how to tell when I should replace nails?)
[21:34] <brousch> I just realized that with my switch to Kivy I no longer have a need for Eclipse
[21:46] <snap-l> Nice.
[21:46] <brousch> Now I have to go watch the rick_h_ vim tutorials again
[21:47] <rick_h_> http://lococast.net/archives/category/screencast
[21:47] <rick_h_> :)
[21:47] <brousch> I lost all knowledge of buffers
[21:54] <brousch> Hm. My talk for MobiDevDay has already been accepted
[22:05] <rick_h_> nice, go brousch go...except he left
