[00:14] <roaksoax> bigjools: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587462/ --> so that'd be the fix for raring localbooting
[00:14] <roaksoax> bigjools: i guess we should only fix that in raring and not in maas/1.2
[00:14] <bigjools> roaksoax: +1
[00:14] <bigjools> on both
[00:20] <roaksoax> bigjools: right but I don't know what will happen if this patch is in quantal or precise
[00:20] <bigjools> roaksoax: we don't need to change them, so forget 'em ;)
[00:21] <roaksoax> bigjools: the only thing is that maas 1.2 will fail to boot anything until we upload maas trunk
[00:21] <roaksoax> if all goes well, it would happen next week
[00:22] <bigjools> roaksoax: that's fine
[00:22] <roaksoax> ok cool then
[00:22] <bigjools> it's not working now, so no change there
[00:22] <roaksoax> bigjools: https://code.launchpad.net/~andreserl/maas/fix_localboot_lp1092265/+merge/145520
[00:25] <roaksoax> bigjools: and this should add raring support: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587476/
[00:26] <bigjools> +1
[00:42] <roaksoax> bigjools: https://code.launchpad.net/~andreserl/maas/maas-1.2-raring-support/+merge/145521
[00:42] <roaksoax> bigjools: https://code.launchpad.net/~andreserl/maas/raring_support/+merge/145522 (this one will update once previous fix lands)
[00:43] <bigjools> roaksoax: well you can add dependent branches which makes the diff correct
[00:50] <roaksoax> done
