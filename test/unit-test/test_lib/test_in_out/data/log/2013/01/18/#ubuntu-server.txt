[12:42] <feisar> (I did the same with /tmp and simply umounted the LV, removed the old /tmp files and remounted but I can't umount /var or course)

[16:21] <frojnd> Hi there.
[16:25] <RoyK> ho
[16:25] <frojnd> Sup, sup :)
[16:30] <TheBronx> hi!
[16:32] <TheBronx> this is probably not the best place to ask this but... any libpcap expert?
[16:33] <TheBronx> I have a simple c program using libpcap, it works but one of the CPU cores is always at 100%...
[16:35] <tboat> hey all, I am trying to get my postfix mail to forward to gmail, ive tried setting up a forward service in postfix conf, but the mail doesn't forward
[16:37] <qhartman> TheBronx, Almost certainly not the place to ask. I would guess though that you've got some expensive loop in there that you don't need.
[16:37] <RoyK> TheBronx: what sort of program are you writing? parsing a big pcap file will usually take some cpu
[16:37] <RoyK> TheBronx: perhaps ##c
[16:38] <TheBronx> thank you qhartman and RoyK. It is just a callback from pcap_loop. I've tried an empty callback but the CPU is still at 100%... weird
[16:39] <RoyK> TheBronx: try ##c
[16:41] <RoyK> TheBronx: or perhaps #ubuntu-offtopic
[16:42] <qhartman> I'd imagine there is a channel on here somewhere that would be more specific to network programming
[16:42] <TheBronx> thank you guys, I love this channel :P
[16:59] <SpamapS> smoser: so default: true doesn't seem to be a thing one can override
[17:00] <SpamapS> smoser: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1546051/
[17:00] <SpamapS> smoser: that pretty much determines if the user is "the system default user"
[17:02] <smoser> SpamapS, well, in trunk the goal here would be that the 'distro' has a 'default_user' that is set via config.
[17:02] <smoser> (config could also come from user-data)
[17:02] <smoser> and then 'user:' would ideally change that also.
[17:02] <smoser> maybe.
[17:02] <smoser> i'm   not sure.
[17:02] <smoser> sorry this sucks.
[17:02] <SpamapS> smoser: right, in this case, I think the 'user: ...' should be assumed to override the distro default.
[17:03] <SpamapS> smoser: or a user that sames default: true
[17:03] <smoser> right. i think that generally makes sense.
[17:03] <SpamapS> s/sames/says/
[17:03] <smoser> tha tits presense baically patches the distro's 'default_user'
[17:03] <SpamapS> smoser: so I may have a patch to do at least part 1, maybe part 2 of my thinking
[17:03] <smoser> on trunk ?
[17:03] <smoser> please do it on trunk.
[17:03] <SpamapS> yeah it would be trunk
[17:03] <smoser> even though thats different from quantal.
[17:04] <SpamapS> there's also something weird about my environment because if I just boot an instance on ec2 or hpcloud, that is basically what happens
[17:04] <SpamapS> thats sort of where I'm stuck and trying to figure out WTF
=== matsubara-lunch is now known as matsubara
[17:05] <eutheria> in /etc/network/interfaces i thought i could define the DNS servers
[17:05] <SpamapS> eutheria: you can but on newer systems you have to do it a little differently
[17:05] <eutheria> so i am using 12.04
[17:06] <eutheria> what do you do now
[17:06] <SpamapS> eutheria: man resolvconf
[17:06] <eutheria> ty
[17:06] <SpamapS> eutheria: you probably just want 'dns-nameservers x.x.x.x y.y.y.y'
[17:07] <eutheria> think so
[17:07] <SpamapS> smoser: is there a way to re-run cloud-init but only check local on-disk metadata? Its a pain for me to iterate by spinning new instances whenever I want to change userdata
[17:08] <eutheria> i only had used resolveconf for openvpn before
[17:08] <smoser> SpamapS, yes.
[17:09] <smoser> SpamapS, see http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/trunk/files/head:/doc/examples/seed/ for example of how to populate directory that will be read rather than user-data/meta-ata in ec2
[17:10] <SpamapS> oh duh
[17:10] <SpamapS> just use the nocloud
[17:10] <smoser> then, you're capable of reading the cloud-init upstart jobs
[17:10] <smoser> just call them in order
[17:10] <SpamapS> yeah
[17:10] <smoser> oh
[17:10] <smoser> rm -Rf /var/lib/cloud
[17:11] <smoser> (that is a bit of a pain (patches welcome) since nocloud looks there)
[17:11] <SpamapS> thats ok
[17:11] <SpamapS> thats what I've been doing to re-run w/ the existing metadata pulled from metadata service
[17:11] <SpamapS> but now i want to change said metadata
[17:11] <smoser> one thing that'd be nice for me to cdocument is how you could use this with overlayroot
[17:11] <smoser> eseentially, you can boot an instance with overlayroot, so that every reboot is "fresh"
[17:11]  * SpamapS could just login to the mysql server hosting it.. but that just seems wrong ;)
[17:11] <smoser> (still have to reboot, but no new instance)
[17:12] <smoser> and you can intentionally make changes to the real root store to persist across reboot
[17:12] <smoser> so many things i have failed to document
[17:12] <SpamapS> smoser: so like schroot, but for instances :)
[17:12] <smoser> right.
[17:17] <smoser> SpamapS, there is #cloud-init fyi.
[17:17] <smoser> and harlowja there is the brains behind the cloud-init operation :)
[17:22] <stuffthatspins> i'm in desperate help… upgraded my server from 10.04 to 12.0.4LTS yesterday. and lost all my additional IP addresses. only the main IP address works.
[17:22] <stuffthatspins> would take advice here or happy to pay offline.
[17:24] <RoyK> stuffthatspins: pastebin /etc/network/interfaces
[17:25] <RoyK> or pm it if you're nervous
[17:34] <zastern> Is there a way to list installed/available AppArmor profiles?
[17:34] <zastern> I'd like to enable the Apache/HTTPD profile but I can't really figure out how
[17:37] <frojnd> zastern | Is there a way to list installed/available AppArmor profiles? apparmor_status
[17:38] <sarnold> frojnd: that'll only show what is currently loaded; there's no easy way to list what is easily available on the system
[17:39] <frojnd> sarnold: gotcha
[17:39] <frojnd> How do I check if mysqld and nginx are automatically enabled at boot?
[17:39] <sarnold> zastern: the apparmor-profiles package will install a /usr/share/doc/apparmor-profiles/extras/usr.sbin.httpd2-prefork   file that you can copy into /etc/apparmor.d/ as a starting point
[17:40] <zastern> sarnold: thanks sir/ma'am. I'll look into thatl.
[17:42] <sarnold> frojnd: the upstart cookbook is where I turn for things like that.. http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#cookbook-and-best-practises
[17:42] <sarnold> frojnd: I think what you need is "initctl list", but it feels like there ought to be something a bit less verbose..
[17:42] <jdstrand> zastern, sarnold: do not that libapache2-mod-apparmor also ships /etc/apparmor.d/usr.lib.apache2.mpm-prefork.apache2. it has directions inside it on how to use it
[17:42] <zastern> do not that?
[17:43] <zastern> ill check that out, thank you!
[17:43] <jdstrand> s/do not/do note/
[17:43] <sarnold> jdstrand: aha, thanks :)
[17:43] <zastern> that sounds more gooder than just a recipie
[17:43] <zastern> an actual mod for apache
[17:43] <jdstrand> sarnold: it is setup so that apache2 itself is unconfined but such that it will use change_hat
[17:44] <stuffthatspins> jdstrand: :)
[17:44] <jdstrand> but that can be changed by modifying the profile obviously
[17:45] <sarnold> jdstrand: ooh, that's nice. :)
[17:45] <jdstrand> mdeslaur: did a nice job with it I think
[17:45] <jdstrand> err
[17:45] <jdstrand> mdeslaur did a nice job with it I think
[17:45] <jdstrand> mdeslaur: nm
[17:45] <zastern> im also toying with SElinux
[17:45] <sarnold> zastern: the mod is especially nice if you've got a few different applications hosted in your apache, it prevents e.g. a stupid phpbb exploit from getting to your other applications..
[17:45] <zastern> yeah i have many
[17:45] <zastern> we have a single apache cluster that hosts many apps
