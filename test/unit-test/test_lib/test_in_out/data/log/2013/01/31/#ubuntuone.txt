[09:48] <grammoboy> can't I just link directly to a mp3 file? http://blabla/bla.mp3
[09:48] <grammoboy> so people can 'save as'
[09:55] <grammoboy> Ubuntuone is slowww
[09:56] <JamesTait> Morning all! :-)
[09:56] <jgdx> grammoboy: from ubuntuone? In the "Files" view, click "More" on the file you want to share and then "Publish file"
[09:57] <grammoboy> jgdx, but then the mp3 plays in the browser
[09:57] <grammoboy> or is that a browser setting
[09:58] <grammoboy> no it isn't
[09:59] <jgdx> grammoboy: you can still "save as"
[10:00] <grammoboy> jgdx, how
[10:01] <grammoboy> jgdx, when you only have the link of the file
[10:01] <grammoboy> jgdx, I know that I as owner can save as, but that's not the queston
[10:01] <jgdx> grammoboy: depends on the browser, but when the file is playing in the browser: "File" -> "Save page as" or Ctrl/cmd + s
[10:01] <grammoboy> jgdx, ah I see, thx
[10:03] <jgdx> grammoboy: you're welcome!
[11:31] <gatox> good morning!
