[16:38] <hannie> Hi my friends. I hope it's not too late to wish you all a happy, healthy New Year
[16:39] <pleia2> happy new year :)
[16:39] <YoBoY> it's never too late :) Happy new year everyone :*
[16:40] <pleia2> and hooray for createspace.com publishing of the 12.10 manual, always nice to see it available for cheaper (I send it to schools, so very helpful!)
[16:41] <hannie> Yes, it is another step in making our manual available for people all over the world
[16:41] <pleia2> :)
[16:41] <pleia2> I brought a few copies to Ghana with me, and we shipped it on all our desktops there
[16:42] <pleia2> (the pdf version)
[16:42] <hannie> That is so nice to hear! Well done
[16:42] <pleia2> the print version was nice though, unreliable power there so folks could read it even when they weren't able to use computers
[16:42] <hannie> Should you get any feedback, please let us know
[16:42] <pleia2> will do :)
[16:44] <hannie> I hope godbyk read this. We're soooo proud of what he does
[16:44] <hannie> *reads

[16:54] <hannie> and you too, CarstenG
[16:55] <CarstenG> Thanks
[17:01] <cqfd93> Hi everybody, and Happy New Year!
[17:01] <hannie> hey Sylvie, happy new year. Still in NM?
[17:02] <cqfd93> yes, untin this Saturday
[17:02] <cqfd93> *until
[17:09] <hannie> CarstenG, I am currently installing the daily build of Raring Ringtail
[17:10] <CarstenG> oh
[17:10] <CarstenG> nice :-)
[17:10] <CarstenG> in a VM, I guess :-)
[17:10] <hannie> If it looks good, I am going to ask our authors/editors to start writing/editing again
[17:10] <hannie> Yes, in VB
[17:11] <hannie> *VM
[17:12] <CarstenG> I guess we will make a team meeting before the start?
[17:13] <hannie> Yes, but before planning a meeting I want to know if Raring is usable
[17:13] <CarstenG> sure
[17:13] <CarstenG> but this can be changed tomorrow :-)
[17:13] <CarstenG> It's a alpha
[17:14] <hannie> I think so, yes
[17:14] <CarstenG> or not yet a alpha :-)
[17:14] <hannie> As long as it contains enough new features to write about
