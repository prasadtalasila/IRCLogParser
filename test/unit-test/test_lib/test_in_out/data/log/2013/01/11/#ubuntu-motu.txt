[21:55] <Aeyoun> Hi. Regarding updating a upstream package. I have successfully followed[1] for version 1.0. Now I want to update to 1.1. But there seems to be a step missing regarding using bzr on[2]. Is there another document that explains it all? [1] http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/singlehtml/index.html#document-ubuntu-packaging-guide/packaging-new-software [2] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete#Creating_and_Using_a_debian.2BAC8-wa

[21:57] <Aeyoun> I end up with one packagename/ that is the bzr repo, and one packagename-1.1/ which is not a repo.
