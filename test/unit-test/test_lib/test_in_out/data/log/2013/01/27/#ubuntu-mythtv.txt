[00:30] <qwebirc17982> hello
[00:30] <qwebirc17982> I'm installing this for the first time can someone help me?
[00:30] <qwebirc17982> I go though the install fine but after it wont boot from the drive
[00:30] <qwebirc17982> It just goes to a black screen and say insert media and press enter
[00:31] <qwebirc17982> Anyone?
[00:31] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, bad burn?
[00:32] <qwebirc17982> no I checked the disk
[00:32] <qwebirc17982> The instal works fine and I burned Mythdora and tried that with with same results
[00:32] <qwebirc17982> it's like it doesn't see a boot drive
[00:32] <tgm4883> oh
[00:32] <tgm4883> sorry, I misread what you said
[00:32] <tgm4883> so after install, it reboots and then isn't booting
[00:33] <tgm4883> just asks for disk or something
[00:33] <tgm4883> did you install from CD or USB?
[00:33] <qwebirc17982> CD
[00:33] <qwebirc17982> Tried installing it to both a harddrive and a thumb drive
[00:34] <qwebirc17982> After the install it says remove the disk and restart
[00:34] <qwebirc17982> upon restarting it sees no boot drive
[00:34] <qwebirc17982> it's like nothing was written to the harddrive
[00:35] <tgm4883> how many hard drives do you have?
[00:37] <qwebirc17982> just the one
[00:37] <qwebirc17982> I actually removed it so I can just install it to the thumb drive now
[00:37] <qwebirc17982> to use it as the main boot partition
[00:37] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, yea it sounds like something got installed somewhere odd
[00:37] <qwebirc17982> I've installed it three times now all with the same results
[00:38] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, you are installing it to a thumb drive?
[00:38] <qwebirc17982> It's like it's just not booting a boot partition for the motherboard to see
[00:38] <qwebirc17982> Yeah after the HD wouldn't work I thought I would try the thumb drive
[00:38] <tgm4883> Did you set your bios to boot from the thumb drive?
[00:39] <tgm4883> (also, does your system support booting from USB?)
[00:40] <qwebirc17982> yes
[00:40] <qwebirc17982> to both
[00:40] <qwebirc17982> Well the thing is it wouldn't work with the HD either
[00:41] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, are you doing manual or automatic partitioning?
[00:41] <qwebirc17982> I used automatic the first time
[00:41] <qwebirc17982> Just now I used manual
[00:41] <qwebirc17982> I just made a /
[00:41] <qwebirc17982> I didn't make a swap or anything else
[00:41] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, where did you tell it to install the boot loader?
[00:41] <qwebirc17982> just to see if it would work
[00:42] <qwebirc17982> ....I didn't
[00:42] <qwebirc17982> how do I do that?
[00:42] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, it's in the installer. IIRC, at the bottom of the partitioning screen
[00:43] <qwebirc17982> so what partions should I have?
[00:43] <tgm4883> well if you are just doing the install drive and are going to have your media separate then
[00:43] <tgm4883>  / and swap
[00:43] <tgm4883> where swap is ~ RAM
[00:44] <qwebirc17982> yes
[00:44] <tgm4883> actually, you could probably go without swap if you have enough ram
[00:44] <qwebirc17982> I have 2GB
[00:44] <tgm4883> hmm
[00:44] <tgm4883> I'd probably add swap then
[00:44] <qwebirc17982> but I don't see the boot
[00:44] <qwebirc17982> do I have to make /boot?
[00:45] <qwebirc17982> and is it /swap?
[00:45] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, no, swap is specified by the partition type (eg. don't format it ext4, make it swap)
[00:46] <qwebirc17982> okay I'm starting this over again right now
[00:46] <tgm4883> ok
[00:47] <qwebirc17982> where do I make the boot?
[00:47] <tgm4883> the boot partition?
[00:47] <qwebirc17982> or how big do i make the boot partition?
[00:48] <tgm4883> you shouldn't need to specify that, it will just reside on /
[00:48] <qwebirc17982> So it will actually
[00:48] <qwebirc17982> oh...
[00:48] <tgm4883> but if you want to make it, probably 100-200MB
[00:48] <qwebirc17982> so it will be /boot
[00:48] <qwebirc17982> ...   /
[00:48] <qwebirc17982> and swap partition?
[00:48] <tgm4883> yea
[00:49] <qwebirc17982> and boot should be ext4 journalied?
[00:49] <tgm4883> yea that is fine
[00:49] <qwebirc17982> make / primary right?
[00:50] <tgm4883> yea
[00:51] <qwebirc17982> okay we'll see if this works
[00:51] <qwebirc17982> thank you
[00:51] <qwebirc17982> I'll be back soon
[02:05] <qwebirc25226> I've got mythfrontend autostarting but the menu bar still shows and clicking in the frontend doesn't make it disappear.  I have to restart the frontend manually. This just started but I can't figure out what I changed. Any ideas?
[02:07] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, are you running standard mythbuntu?
[02:07] <tgm4883> eg. xfce?
[02:07] <tgm4883> or Unity/Ubuntu
[02:07] <qwebirc25226> ya
[02:07] <qwebirc25226> xfce
[02:07] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, did you change something in screen setup?
[02:07] <tgm4883> in the frontend?
[02:08] <qwebirc25226> I don't think so...it fixes itself when I exit and start it again from the menu
[02:09] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, it fixes itself. Ok, so what do you do to make it happen?
[02:09] <qwebirc25226> reboot the computer
[02:10] <tgm4883> hmm ok, so it starts with it visable?
[02:10] <tgm4883> strange
[02:11] <qwebirc25226> ya....I've got multiple frontends too and I've only noticed it on this one
[02:11] <tgm4883> hmm
[02:11] <qwebirc17982> how to I set up a capture card?
[02:11] <tgm4883> it's a 12.04 install?
[02:12] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, via mythtv-setup
[02:12] <qwebirc25226> ya...upgraded to 12.10....well....I can't remember what version I started with
[02:12] <qwebirc25226> 11.04 maybe?
[02:13] <qwebirc17982> when I go to the set up it only lets me set up video and audio
[02:13] <qwebirc17982> I never get a tuner option
[02:14] <tgm4883> qwebirc17982, you need to exit the frontend and go to the mythtv backend setup (or run mythtv-setup from the command line)
[02:14] <qwebirc17982> how do I do that?
[02:14] <qwebirc17982> sorry I'm really new to this
[02:15] <tgm4883> exit the frontend?
[02:15] <tgm4883> or start the backend setup?
[02:15] <qwebirc17982> get to the command line
[02:15] <tgm4883> ah
[02:15] <qwebirc25226> it's in the menu....under system
[02:15] <tgm4883> in the applications menu you should have something labeled terminal
[02:17] <qwebirc17982> now what is the command for mythtv-setup?
[02:18] <tgm4883> mythtv-setup
[02:18] <tgm4883> :)
[02:18] <qwebirc25226> just run it from the menu if you're new to this...much easier
[02:18] <qwebirc17982> also how to I get the screen config to stick?
[02:18] <tgm4883> that works too
[02:18] <tgm4883> screen config?
[02:19] <qwebirc17982> it's off screen right now
[02:19] <qwebirc17982> I went to the set up for that but when I esc it defaults
[02:20] <qwebirc25226> is it nvidia?
[02:20] <tgm4883> could be, I'd have to know what parts are off the screen
[02:21] <qwebirc17982> I have a hauppauge 1600 TV tuner card
[02:21] <qwebirc17982> I don't see it on the set up list
[02:21] <tgm4883> it's DVB
[02:22] <qwebirc25226> a 1600 is atsc and analog...I'm using one too
[02:24] <qwebirc25226> for analog use the pvr-x50 or something like that
[02:29] <qwebirc25226> tgm4883: for my issue I just thought I'd check and see if you had heard of it before...I'll keep poking around...thanks
[02:30] <tgm4883> 1600 is DVB (I've got one, although I didn't use the analog side)
[02:30] <tgm4883> I'm unsure on the screen thing
[02:32] <qwebirc25226> I'm using both....it's nice to be able to add ota hd to my sd satellite feed
[02:47] <qwebirc17982> using a keyboard what is the menu key?
[03:03] <tgm4883> m
[19:17] <qwebirc7246> I am trying to install mythbuntu and can't get it to recognize the video capture card which is a hauppauge 1850.
[19:18] <qwebirc7246> I just bought a Hauppauge 1850 to use with Mythbuntu 12.04.  It does not seem to recognize the card. Any suggestions?
[19:28] <gregL> qwebirc7246, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1392684
[19:33] <qwebirc7246> That thread seems to indicate that he got the 1850 to work with Ubuntu 9.10, extracted the channel scan information, and then used that for installing another application, ME TV.  No information about how he got MythTV to see the card....
