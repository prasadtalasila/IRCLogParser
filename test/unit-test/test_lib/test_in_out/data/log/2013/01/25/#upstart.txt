[00:49] <mangoman> Howdy again. So I changed the location of my pidfile in my jobfile, but whenever I try to run it , it's still trying to write to the old location, as though upstart hasn't recognized that the file has changed. What up with that?
[01:16] <mangoman> nevermind, I'm an idiot
[01:18] <xnox> mangoman: I don't think you are an idiot. We are glad to provide forum for you to think out loud and come up with a solution! =))))
[01:39] <munderwo-work> Hi all. I have a process that is being handled by upstart. I've got it handling SIGTERM signals, and I understand that this is what upstart emits when doing a stop <service>.the problem is that upstart doesnt seem to be waiting for my process to handle the signal and shutdown gracefully. Is there an extra timeout that I need to give upstart to make it wait longer?
[01:39] <munderwo-work> or am I misunderstanding what SIGTERM is supposed to do?
[03:21] <mangoman> So now my job is hanging whenever I try to interact with it
[03:22] <mangoman> when I start it, It doesn't say anything, jsut gives me a blank line and I have to ctrl+C it
[03:22] <mangoman> but apparently it's not actually stopped, so I do `stop job` and it also hangs in the same way
[03:23] <mangoman> if I use `initctl` on it before i stop it, that also hangs
[03:23] <mangoman> and the script is fine because if I copy the exact script to a different name and run that, it works perfectly
[03:23] <mangoman> is there a cache of some sort that I can clear out?
[03:27] <mangoman> also when it does that hanging stuff it doesn't record anything to the upstart log
[15:42] <xnox> stgraber: i think jodh is deep in coding =))))
[15:44] <stgraber> jibel: :)
[15:44] <stgraber> oops, just meant ":)"
[20:26] <jodh> stgraber/xnox: indeed - apologies - only just finished.
