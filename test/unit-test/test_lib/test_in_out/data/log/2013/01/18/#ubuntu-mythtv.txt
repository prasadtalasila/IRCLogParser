[00:06] <Shadow__1> tgm4883: do you think a system that was upgraded from 8.04 through to 10.04 lts would upgrade easily to 12.04 lts? using mythbuntu the entire time
=== Shadow__1 is now known as Shadow__X
[00:07] <tgm4883> no
[00:07] <Shadow__X> :(
[00:07] <Shadow__X> does that mean a fresh install would be the best option?
[00:08] <tgm4883> I'd like to think it would, but there is/was an issue at one point where after doing so it wouldn't boot properly
[00:08] <Shadow__X> i was able to upgrade from 8.04 to 10.04 (going through each version one by one as there didnt seem to be any other choice)
[00:08] <tgm4883> I do a fresh install when I upgrade
[00:09] <Shadow__X> i guess your recordings are on another partition other than boot then
[00:09] <tgm4883> yea, they are on my NAS
[00:09] <Shadow__X> also does your mythtv server do more than mythtv?
[00:09] <tgm4883> It used to
[00:10] <tgm4883> but since then, I've farmed out my other things to my NAS
[00:10] <Shadow__X> hmm my server does a bit including housing my raid5 array and my file server it would be a pain to do a clean install
[00:12] <tgm4883> Shadow__X, bug 978464
[00:12] <Zinn> Bug 978464 in grub2 (Ubuntu) "After LTS->LTS (lucid2precise) upgrade, upon reboot drops into grub recovery shell" [Critical, Fix Released] http://www.launchpad.net/bugs/978464
[00:12] <tgm4883> that is the one I was thinking about
[00:13] <Shadow__X> you would think canocal would test lts upgrades considering what they are for
[00:13] <tgm4883> Shadow__X, lts upgrades are tested with everything in main
[00:14] <tgm4883> and this looks fixed
[00:14] <Shadow__X> so what caused this to happen? and yes its filed as fixed under 12.04.1
[00:15] <tgm4883> skimming that bug report, it was some syntax errors in the grub.cfg file
[00:16] <tgm4883> yea looks like it
[00:16] <tgm4883>  * Switch to backwards compatible ${} syntax for grub.cfg (LP: #978464)
[00:17] <Shadow__X> it seems like the bug was avoidable though if you opted to install the new packages it recommended
[00:17] <ubuntuaddicted> can anyone help me troubleshoot why mythweb is only displaying a blank page?
[00:17] <Shadow__X> i am going to do what jya did and install a 8.04 image then do the upgrades to 12.04 to check if it works properly or what i have to do to make sure it works properly
[00:19] <tgm4883> Shadow__X, IIRC, the workaround for the bug was to boot a live cd and fix/reinstall grub
[00:20] <Shadow__X> yeah i am going to check to see if its fixed by install mythbuntu 8.04 and try upgrading all the way through
[00:20] <Shadow__X> but yeah as you said luckily even if it did happen there is a way to fix it
[00:21] <ubuntuaddicted> does anyone run mythweb? can you tell me what the permissions and owner/group is?
[00:23] <Shadow__X> seems to be root root for everything except data which is root www-data
[00:23] <Shadow__X> data appears to be 775
[00:23] <tgm4883> ubuntuaddicted, probably should check apache logs
[00:24] <Shadow__X> seems like everything else is 755
[00:24] <ubuntuaddicted> tgm4883, i did, here's what it says: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2105880
[00:26] <ubuntuaddicted> Shadow__X, that's what mine is also, thanks
[00:26] <ubuntuaddicted> so I have no idea how to troubleshoot why mythweb stopped working
[00:26] <tgm4883> Looks like you need to debug PHP. Maybe since you had table corruption and Im unsure what was done to fix it, and purge/reinstall of mythweb & apache is in order?
[00:27] <Shadow__X> tgm4883: is there a way to get the mythbuntu 8.04 desktop image? only the alternative image is listed on the page
[00:28] <ubuntuaddicted> tgm4883, will that screw anything else up? removing and reinstalled mythweb and apache2?
[00:28] <ubuntuaddicted> i run phpmyadmin as well transmission-deamon website thingy
[00:28] <tgm4883> Shadow__X, nope, we built images ourselves back then, so IDK if you can find them anywhere
[00:29] <ubuntuaddicted> tgm4883, i am running mythbuntu 10.04 which is 0.23.1+fixes
[00:29] <tgm4883> ubuntuaddicted, I assume it will remove phpmyadmin as well (or at least unconfigure it), I'm not sure about the transmission thing
[00:32] <Shadow__X> tgm4883: you think this mirror is safe? http://linux.softpedia.com/progDownload/Mythbuntu-Download-27771.html
[00:32] <ubuntuaddicted> tgm4883, well, i'll try that i guess
[00:34] <ubuntuaddicted> tgm4883, you think i should use the mythbuntu-control-center to reinstall mythweb, or over ssh like I was going to?
[00:34] <tgm4883> ssh
[00:35] <tgm4883> Shadow__X, IDK
[00:35] <Shadow__X> telnet to ssh to webmin
[00:35] <tgm4883> Shadow__X, I've only got MD5SUMS back to 10.04
[00:36] <Shadow__X> hmm is there a way to get the sums for 8.04
[00:36] <tgm4883> not without a known good disk
[00:36] <Shadow__X> i dont know if i still have the disk considering i did the install in 2008
[00:38] <Shadow__X> hmm both of them link to the alternative one already linked to on mythbuntus page
[00:41] <Shadow__X> i can get ubuntu 8.04 how different is ubuntu compared to mythbuntu other than xfce? Also would upgrading from 10.04 to 12.04 be about the same as 8.04 to 10.04 to 12.04
[00:42] <tgm4883> I'd think a Ubuntu 8.04 disk would work
[00:45] <Shadow__X> i guess i could use mythbuntu alternative right
[00:45] <tgm4883> yea
[00:45]  * tgm4883 hometime
[00:45] <Shadow__X> thanks
[00:49] <Shadow__X> tgm4883: btw on the mythbuntu site about brings you to mythbuntu.org/home where as clicking the logo brings you to sites.google/com/r/mythbuntu.org/website
[00:50] <ubuntuaddicted> tgm4883, i got an error about microbridgeconfig or something and it said it had to disable that plugin? is that anything related to mythweb?
[00:54] <ubuntuaddicted> wtf, i chose to use mythbunthu-control-center to install mythweb and it didn't even reinstall apache2
[00:54] <ubuntuaddicted> that can't be write. lol
[00:54] <ubuntuaddicted> *right
[01:10] <Shadow__X> you could do sudo dkpg-reconfigure apache2 to reinstall it but i am not sure if that would help you might need to remove it then install it
[01:10] <Shadow__X> tgm is in the process of going home so you could wait for him to get back
[01:13] <ubuntuaddicted> ok, thanks. someone is attempting to help within the ubuntu channel.
[02:06]  * tgm4883 is home now
[12:19] <dekarl1> superm1: tgm4883: any news on the "build a fixes PPA with a patch" webservice? I'm about to set up a PPA with patched fixes so users can test, but I'd rather not learn how to do that now if I can do it later :)
=== dekarl1 is now known as dekarl
[14:36] <superm1> dekarl1: unfortunately not, it's gotten on the backburner.  for you to do that, it should just be to build with ./build-dsc.sh rather than ./build-debs.sh along with setting DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME.  that's how we do it with https://code.launchpad.net/~mythbuntu/mythbuntu/mythbuntu-weekly-build

[20:53] <Bray90820> so every time i startup ubuntu i get this error
[20:53] <Bray90820> mythlogserver crashed with SIGSEGV in QObject::disconnect()
=== len is now known as Guest29743
[21:04] <superm1> Bray90820: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mythtv/+bug/1029723 ?
[21:04] <Bray90820> thank you i will have a look
[21:05] <superm1> well no fix yet, but i think that's the bug
[21:06] <dekarl> I need fixes/0.26 packaging, too?
[21:06] <superm1> dekarl: well that branch is not packaging, packaging is all on github
[21:06] <superm1> it pivots around the right packaging branch from github
[21:07] <dekarl> ahh, I'm talking about manualy switching my checkout of mythtv/packaging to build the "dsc"
[21:09] <superm1> ah.  yeah you should switch the packaging to 0.26 to build the dsc
[21:09] <superm1> it's just git checkout fixes/0.26 and then rerun the command
[21:09] <superm1> because packaging is stored in the same branch that the build scripts are now
[21:09] <dekarl> do you mind if I commit that (to master and the 0.25 part to 0.26/fixes) http://paste.ubuntu.com/1546715/
[21:10] <dekarl> aye, noticed that. It reminded me of that uncommited changes :)
[21:12] <superm1> yeah that's fine
[21:12] <superm1> make sure you prefix the commit message with deb: though
[21:12] <dekarl> ok
[21:12] <superm1> at some point i'm gonna fix up the script to take all messages that start with deb: and put them in the changelog it generates
[21:12] <superm1> so i've been making sure to commit using deb: for all mine
[21:13] <superm1> we do need a better solution than this endless conflicts/replaces at some point too
[21:13] <superm1> library packages shouldn't have to conflict with each other.
[21:27] <dekarl> superm1: I'm not sure that there is any point in putting the #ABI# in the package name at the moment. I like the idea, but its not working
[21:28] <superm1> dekarl: well i think the solution might be to move the files that are in the libmyth package that don't follow the ABI in the file name out to a different package
[21:28] <superm1> so libmyth-#ABI# really can work
[21:29] <dekarl> but what do we get in return?
=== chiluk_away is now known as chiluk
[21:30] <superm1> well in theory packages can link to libmyth-#ABI# then
[21:30] <superm1> and more likely to land in debian some day (TM)
[21:30] <superm1> there's a laundry list of items in my email to fix before can go into debian though too
[21:31] <dekarl> and by packages you mean third party plugins?
[21:31] <superm1> yeah
[21:31] <superm1> or say video players or something
[21:31] <dekarl> do we have any? :D
[21:31] <superm1> haha yeah i see what you're getting at, i agree
[21:31] <dekarl> nah, video players should use the Services API
[21:32] <dekarl> and by video players I'm thinking of e.g. xbmc
[21:32] <superm1> yeah and something like XBMC should use services API too
[21:32] <superm1> or upnp
[21:34] <dekarl> does anyone support UPNP for scheduling and guide? I've seen specs but never heard of someone really implementing it
[21:34] <dekarl> LiveTV is coming to HDHR if I understood correctly
[21:35] <dekarl> ok, I got 5x mythtv*fixes* files what do I do with them?
[21:36] <dekarl> upload them to laundpad by hand?
[21:50] <dekarl> looks like I need to sign a code of conduct first (before I get my PPA's key so I can upload the source package)
[21:50] <superm1> dekarl: no one i know does upnp scheduling / guide right now
[21:50] <superm1> and yeah HDHR got live tv yesterday via DLNA
[21:51] <superm1> so the 5x files you got, you need to sign the .changes
[21:51] <superm1> and then dput it to your PPA and it will upload all the necessary files
[21:52] <dekarl> ohhh, and the key must be on the ubuntu keyserver, but no link to the search so I can check if its there, man
[21:53] <dekarl> I begin to like the idea of a web service to avoid these hoops more and more :D
[21:54] <superm1> hehe
[21:54] <dekarl> I just want to offer a PPA with the AC3 patch so the user can test it without fiddling with building his own packages... its not for me and my gain is little. so uncovering one hoop after another sucks
[21:56] <dekarl> found the keyserver, moving on http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=dekarl&fingerprint=on
[21:56] <superm1> well once you have your PPA all set up, it's trivial to upload new packages to it though in the future
[21:56] <superm1> so if you want to help other users in the future it shouldn't be as much work again
[22:40] <dekarl> yeah, signed the code of conduct :)
[22:54] <dekarl> man, now I signed the dsc and source.changes, when I try to dput it complains that the checksum doesnt match
[22:55] <dekarl> do I need to run build-dsc.sh *after* properly setting up gpg and activated the key at launchpad?
[23:11] <superm1> it shouldn't change the checksum while signing
[23:11] <superm1> but you only need to sign the changes file, not the dsc file
[23:11] <superm1> the changes file includes all the checksums for the other files, so if you independently signed the dsc it might change it
[23:13] <dekarl> dput complain if the .dsc is not signed
[23:14] <dekarl> but signind the .dsc changes its hash so the source.changes contains the wrong hash :(
[23:18] <dekarl> manually recalculation the checksums in the source.changes after signing the .dsc worked, its uploading now
[23:20] <dekarl> Now I need to figure out how to tell it to build for amd64 12.04 lts
[23:25] <tgm4883> dekarl, that would be via debian/changelog
[23:25] <tgm4883> precise
[23:27] <dekarl> that file starts with "mythtv (2:0.26.0+fixes.20120505.4b8b3cc-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low"
[23:27] <dekarl> I guess thats not what I want?
[23:28] <tgm4883> dekarl, s/UNRELEASED/precise/
[23:29] <dekarl> then build again?
[23:30] <tgm4883> yea
[23:30] <dekarl> ahh 0030 over here, I'm to tired to change / run build-dsc / manually update the checksums / wait for upload to finish ... again  new. will try again tomorrow
[23:30] <dekarl> s/new/now/
[23:31] <dekarl> thanks for help up to here
[23:32] <superm1> wait you shouldn't have to be manually updating or changing checksums or anything
[23:33] <superm1> set DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME before you run ./build-dsc.sh
[23:33] <superm1> to the same as your GPG key
[23:33] <superm1> and it should do the signing during build then instead
[23:34] <dekarl> I have "export DEBEMAIL="dekarl@spaetfruehstuecken.org"" and "export DEBFULLNAME="Karl Dietz"" checking after manual signing gets me "gpg: Good signature from "Karl Dietz <dekarl@spaetfruehstuecken.org>""
[23:35] <dekarl> gpg.conf has the right default key set
[23:35] <superm1> and try to set UBUNTU_RELEASE to precise to get it set right while going too
[23:36] <superm1> and are you signing using debsign?
[23:36] <superm1> or just gpg on it's own
[23:36] <superm1> debuild is supposed to be calling debsign anyway during build, but something sounds off
[23:37] <dekarl> just gpg
[23:37] <superm1>  ah debsign actually signs the changes and dsc at the same time
[23:37] <superm1> and probably fixes checksums if necessary
[23:38] <dekarl> I have debsign installed, so its not that
[23:39] <superm1> try calling debsign with the changes file as the argument
[23:39] <superm1> and it should sign the changes and dsc for you
[23:39] <superm1> although maybe if you're still having trouble, post the exact command you're running and the output and i'll see if the error that's coming up stands out
[23:40] <dekarl> thats the script that I call http://paste.ubuntu.com/1547080/
[23:41] <superm1> and that DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME match what's for your GPG key right?
[23:42] <dekarl> I think so Karl Dietz <dekarl@spaetfruehstuecken.org>
[23:43] <superm1> ok, so can you pastebin the output from a full run with that then?
[23:44] <superm1> the only other thing we're doing is setting the suffix and an extra DEBUILD_FLAGS in our script as far as i can tell
[23:45] <dekarl> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1547103/
[23:49] <superm1> oh it's getting called with -us -uc
[23:49] <superm1> that causes it to not sign
[23:49] <superm1> (-us no sign dsc) (-uc no sign changes)
[23:49] <dekarl> but debsign works well incl. fixup
[23:49] <dekarl> hmm, maybe that should depend on $0 ?
[23:49] <superm1> i see the problem. it's really silly
[23:49] <superm1> https://github.com/MythTV/packaging/blob/fixes/0.26/deb/build-debs.sh sets DEBUILD_FLAGS not to sign by default
[23:49] <superm1> unless you override ahead of time
[23:50] <superm1> most people don't need to sign with builds, which is why it was set that way
[23:50] <superm1> so in your script set DEBUILD_FLAGS="-S -i -sa"
[23:50] <superm1> -S is to build a source package, -i ignores .git and -sa include orig.tar.gz tarball in upload
[23:54] <dekarl> -S gets dynamically prepended but somehow its still getting -us -uc
[23:55] <superm1> hmm as long as you export DEBUILD_FLAGS before calling the script i don't see how, but i guess you'll need to set -x if you can't find it
[23:56] <dekarl> funny, it prints -us -uc but does sign later
[23:57] <dekarl> but I have signed .dsc .changes and  mythtv (2:0.26.0+fixes.20130119.8f8274a-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low
[23:58] <dekarl> uploading again... btw how long does it take until I see any change related to the upload of the source package?
[23:59] <superm1> glad that worked.  um probably within 5-15 minutes you'll see it on the PPA
[23:59] <superm1> and then the PPA has an estimate of the time to build
[23:59] <dekarl> hmm, then the first upload did not work
[23:59] <dekarl> I'll see if it worked out tomorrow :)
