[16:50] <qwebirc62201> I would like to buy a hd tuner ''Hauppauge 1213 WinTV-HVR2250 PCIe Dual TV Tuner''
[16:50] <qwebirc62201> Will it work with mythbuntu?
[17:08] <rhpot1991> grumble, wait for an answer

[18:35] <rhpot1991> grrrr
[18:35]  * rhpot1991 gets back from lunch
[18:58] <tgm4883> lol
[20:12] <tgm4883> dmfrey, ping
[20:13] <tgm4883> dmfrey, when you download the schedule from the backend in the android app, are you just getting the basic info, or are you doing a details grab too (eg. for description)
[20:18] <dmfrey> tgm4883, we are just doing the basic stuff right now
[20:18] <dmfrey> it is quicker to download
[20:18] <tgm4883> yea it is
[20:18] <tgm4883> I was just wondering if that is why it took so long to run
[20:18] <dmfrey> it is my thinking that eventually, we will be able to click on a episode in the guide, then do a quick download of the full program details
[20:19] <dmfrey> i am going to be switching it at some point to load it into a content provider and not store the files
[20:19] <tgm4883> I was just testing it in a unity scope and it goes from 20 seconds to 90 minutes on my laptop
[20:19] <tgm4883> dmfrey, so is it just the slower processor on the phones that is causing it to take so long?
[20:20] <dmfrey> i am still struggling with how to present it
[20:20] <dmfrey> i think so
[20:20] <dmfrey> it downloads really fast on my n7
[20:20] <tgm4883> hmm ok
[20:20] <tgm4883> takes forever on my nexus 4
[20:20] <tgm4883> define really fast
[20:21] <dmfrey> when I first installed the app on it, it took maybe 10 or so to do the whole 2 week guide
[20:21] <tgm4883> 10 minutes?
[20:21] <dmfrey> yes, sorry, forgot that part :)
[20:21] <tgm4883> I wouldn't call that really fast :/
[20:21]  * rhpot1991 agrees
[20:21] <dmfrey> compared to what it was
[20:22] <dmfrey> and it is only the first time through
[20:22] <rhpot1991> doesn't seem like its /that/ much data to take that long
[20:22] <tgm4883> dmfrey, I'm not a java programmer (I haven't done java since college), but mind if I take a look at that part?
[20:23] <rhpot1991> tgm4883: its on github you know?
[20:23] <tgm4883> yea, but IDK where everything is on there
[20:23] <tgm4883> I kinda looked a bit once
[20:24] <tgm4883> dmfrey, so for my unity scope, currently I download everything in the background and stick it in a sqlite db, then just search the db
[20:25] <dmfrey> yes, feel free to take a look
[20:25] <tgm4883> it sounds like you are planning that, but it's all in files right now?
[20:25] <dmfrey> let me find you the class
[20:25] <dmfrey> right
[20:25] <dmfrey> then it has to load the files, parse the json and render it
[20:25] <dmfrey> db will be much faster...i hope
[20:27] <dmfrey> https://github.com/MythTV-Clients/MythTV-Android-Frontend/blob/master/src/org/mythtv/service/guide/ProgramGuideDownloadService.java
[20:27] <dmfrey> this is the one that is currently in use
[20:27] <dmfrey> this is the new one that will load the data to the content provider
[20:27] <dmfrey> https://github.com/MythTV-Clients/MythTV-Android-Frontend/blob/master/src/org/mythtv/service/guide/ProgramGuideDownloadServiceNew.java
[20:27] <dmfrey> you should probably pull down the whole code base so you can link to any dependencies
[20:29] <dmfrey> tgm4883, how are you planning on loading the interface from sqlite
[20:29] <tgm4883> dmfrey, loading the interface? I suppose you mean getting the right layout for a tv guide?
[20:29] <dmfrey> it is not a straight forward join between the channels and programs as it has to span across time
[20:30] <dmfrey> yes, in your unity lense
[20:30] <dmfrey> i am thinking it will be possible in android to generate list of channels
[20:30] <dmfrey> somehow maintain a link of timeslot headers
[20:31] <dmfrey> and then only load from the db what is on the screen and try to no load the whole guide for the timeslot range
[20:31] <tgm4883> dmfrey, yea, I'm not doing that part. There is a developer working on layout stuff for Ubuntu TV that should resolve that
[20:31] <tgm4883> so I'll just pass along starttime/endtime/etc
[20:31] <dmfrey> gotcha
[20:32] <tgm4883> haven't figured out how we'll display search results though
[20:32] <tgm4883> probably similiar to how it's done with videos currently with just a tile
[20:34] <dmfrey> other thing is the programs aren't always going to be a standard width
[20:34] <dmfrey> i.e. half hour, hour, multi-hour programs
[20:35] <tgm4883> dmfrey, yea, my initial thoughts were  doing 5 minute increments in a table like structure
[20:35] <tgm4883> and then taking as many as necessary for width

[22:30] <qwebirc76931> Can anyone help me downgrade from 0.25 to 0.24? I've just reinstalled Mythbuntu but now it says my database is too old, and I need to run mythtv-setup for versions 22,23,24 instead.
[22:33] <qwebirc76931> I've tried setting the repos in Mythbuntu Control Centre, but can only select 25 and upwards.
[22:34] <qwebirc76931> I've also done sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mythbuntu/0.24
