[14:49] <deepee> hi all. I'm doing an install of mythbuntu and want to customise partitions, so that I can choose the disk it installs the o/s to, what partitions get created on the boot (o/s) drive by default ?
[14:54] <deepee> just realised that accepting the default lets you pick the disk - no reply needed ! :-)
