[09:02] <czajkowski> avtobiff: dosnt sound like a lp issue. you'll need to ask in #canonical-isd or fill in https://forms.canonical.com/sso-support/
[09:05] <avtobiff> ok, why isn't it an lp issue?
[09:05] <czajkowski> It sounds like a SSO on issue.
[09:06] <avtobiff> ok
[09:06] <avtobiff> i asked there
[09:06] <avtobiff> thanks!

[12:20] <DavidInPerth> Hi all
[12:22] <DavidInPerth> I have a problem
[12:24] <czajkowski> DavidInPerth: which is ?
[12:24] <DavidInPerth> The situation is:
[12:24] <DavidInPerth> I've been looking into an ubuntu bug for a little while now (maybe a couple of weeks)...
[12:25] <DavidInPerth> There is a bug listing on launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/casper/+bug/932663), which is marked as Fix Released
[12:25] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 932663 in casper (Ubuntu) "kernel upgrade failed on a USB live system created by usb-creator" [High,Fix released]
[12:25] <czajkowski> DavidInPerth: right but we don't control Ubuntu bugs
[12:25] <czajkowski> you'd need to ppke someone in #ubuntu-bugs
[12:25] <czajkowski> I think that's the right channel
[12:25] <czajkowski> let me check
[12:26] <DavidInPerth> I was wondering... yeah, thanks, that would be good
[12:26] <czajkowski> yup that's the channel
[12:26] <czajkowski> DavidInPerth: LP is the hosting side of things, lots of projects use it especially Ubuntu
[12:27] <DavidInPerth> yeah, I only knew about #ubuntu-discuss and #ubuntu-phone (and #launchpad)
[12:27] <DavidInPerth> I think I'll load up the channel list again, see if I can sort alphabetically
[12:27] <DavidInPerth> ...see all channels starting with #ubuntu
[12:27] <DavidInPerth> thanks for your help

[17:48] <knipwim> hi people, does launchpad support translating multiple branches?
[17:50] <czajkowski> knipwim: https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/Guide  and https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/StartingToTranslate  should be able to help you
[17:51] <knipwim> reading those already
[17:54] <knipwim> but, as far as I can tell, you can only select one branch to import from
[17:54] <knipwim> i'll keep looking though

[19:28] <YoBoY> Hi
[19:30] <YoBoY> I don't know if it's a bug or not but, I requested an account merge and I was a bit surprised to see the email of the account I want to merge to my main account in clear. This account don't have public email adress, I shouldn't be able to see this email before the merge is confirmed ^^" (don't know if I'm clearâ€¦)
=== deryck[lunch] is now known as deryck
[19:35] <dobey> what account doesn't have a public e-mail address?
[19:38] <YoBoY> the account I want to merge into my main account
[19:38] <YoBoY> https://launchpad.net/~test-yoboy
[19:40] <dobey> where did you see the e-mail in the clear?
[19:40] <YoBoY> I can make a screenshot of the "Merge request sent" page where this "not public" email appears
[19:40] <dobey> you filed a bug or asked a question to request the merge?
[19:41] <YoBoY> http://ubuntuone.com/6rNtw1KFyepcfr4ABvqpLo
[19:41] <YoBoY> I was in the process of the merge
[19:42] <YoBoY> and came here to know if it's a feature or a bug ^^" I can oppen a bug on that if needed :)
[19:42] <dobey> oh, ok; looks like a bug to me
[19:43] <YoBoY> I open a bug here : https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+filebug ?
[19:43] <dobey> yes
=== slank is now known as slank_away

[20:34] <Annabel> hi all, I can not access http://bazaar.launchpad.net/ (to view source code), though any other launchpad site is accessible for me. Has anyone else encountered this problem?
[20:36] <lifeless> Annabel: what exact url ?
[20:36] <Annabel> lifeless: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/inkscape/trunk/files
[20:36] <lifeless> Annabel: ok, that worked for me. What happens when you try ?
[20:36] <Annabel> though access to the source code via the bazaar client in windows also returns in a tryout
[20:36] <Annabel> *return in a timout
[20:37] <Annabel> in linux I get a message saying that the connection is refused
[20:37] <Annabel> so windows: timeout / linux refused connection
[20:39] <lifeless> your host may have been blocked for some reason. Do you have another machine you can test from, to rule that out ?
[20:39] <YoBoY> work for me too
[20:39] <lifeless> Or, you may have incorrect DNS details for the host (e.g. if you have a hosts file override for it)
[20:39] <lifeless> Annabel: can you ping 91.189.95.84
[20:40] <Annabel> lifeless: successfull ping within roughly 50 ms
[20:40] <lifeless> ok
[20:40] <lifeless> so you have ip level connectiivty
[20:40] <lifeless> try
[20:40] <lifeless> telnet 91.189.95.84 80
[20:41] <lifeless> GET /~inkscape.dev/inkscape/trunk/files HTTP/1.1
[20:41] <lifeless> Host: bazaar.launchpad.net
[20:41] <lifeless>  
[20:41] <Annabel> oops, I should chenge to linux then ...
[20:41] <Annabel> I have no telnet app on windows
[20:41] <lifeless> windows has telnet
[20:41] <lifeless> or it used to
[20:41] <lifeless> might be in a download pack these days or something
[20:42] <Annabel> I guess since windows vista not anymore
[20:43] <Annabel> hmmm ... putty should do
[20:43] <Annabel> though I do not seem to get access at port 80
[20:44] <Annabel> nor default port 23
[20:45] <Annabel> I suspect there is a router / firewall problem
[20:47] <Annabel> either at launchpad or at my ISP (195.130.128.0/19)
[20:48] <Annabel> so I came here ...
[20:48] <lifeless> ok
[20:48] <lifeless> I suggest you ask in #canonical-sysadmin, as the UK LP folk have finished and the AU folk are still asleep :)
[20:49] <lifeless> but sysadmin coverage is 24x7
[20:49] <Annabel> ok, thanks for the suggestion
[20:49] <lifeless> or x5, depending on ugency :)
[20:49] <Annabel> :-)

[22:14] <paultag> I'd be happy to share links in query
[22:15] <paultag> (it's an alioth list, so everyone got a copy)

[22:35] <czajkowski> not sure you;ll find him here tbh any more
[22:35] <czajkowski> perhaps in #bzr

[22:35] <paultag> sorry :)
