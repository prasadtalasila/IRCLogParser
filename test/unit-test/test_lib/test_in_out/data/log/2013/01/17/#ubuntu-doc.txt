[04:46] <keisterstash> Hello, I'm a contributor to the netsniff-ng project and I would like to write Ubuntu documentation on it. How do I go about creating a community pages with installation instructions and examples?
[04:47] <keisterstash> this page isn't really helping me, am i missing something: https://help.ubuntu.com/community
[05:16] <Atamira> you should email the mailing list
[05:16] <Atamira> thats your best bet
[05:16] <Atamira> otherwise you might have to wait a while for a reply to your question
[05:17] <Atamira> and when i say a while, the last time anything was said in here was....nearly 3 days ago..heh
[05:18] <Atamira> uh, make that 6-7 days ago
[05:21] <keisterstash> k thx for the response
[06:11] <Flannel> keisterstash: The community section is a moin wiki, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HelpForBeginners will get you started, with https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HelpOnEditing helping on actual markup syntax (I'm sure it's linked somewhere in the previous page)
