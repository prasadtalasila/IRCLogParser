[02:52] <skellat> Hmm...it looks like we're going to skip the releases between LTS releases.  This may be a good thing.
[04:32] <Unit193> paultag: Poke, got a sec?
[12:48] <dzho> meet the new Debian, same as the old Debian
[14:27] <paultag> Unit193: yessir.
[14:27] <paultag> What can I do to help?
[14:28] <Unit193> Well, nothing at the moment, was/am looking into the route of getting a package in Debian, don't think it'd go so well. :P
[14:31] <paultag> ah :)
[14:31] <paultag> why not? :)
[14:31] <paultag> I'd be happy to help you get started, and if it's within my core bits, i'd be happy to sponsor
[14:33] <Unit193> Debian is quite strict, but the larger one is I'm guessing they'd want a name other than "Unit 193" (which happens to be what I'm known as), and history of the package, last person that tried was an issue.
[14:33] <Unit193> (So says the dev of it)
[14:33] <paultag> well
[14:33] <paultag> I'm a fairly average DD
[14:33] <paultag> Debian is about as strict as me
[14:33] <paultag> don't worry about that
[14:34] <paultag> as for the name thing, we can find a way around that, no problem.
[14:34] <paultag> and what do you mean, the last person was an issue
[14:36] <Unit193> <@h2> Unit193: oh, sorry, I left out some stuff, the last guy who tried packaging it ended up constantly bugging me about this or that, and telling  the debian guys wrong things where I had to do all this research just to make sure he didn't totally mess it up, ie, it wasn't labor saving for me.  <@h2> he also kept misreading and misunderstanding simple documentation and creating issues where none existeed  <@h2> thus my fear that the ...
[14:36] <Unit193> ... debian guys remember inxi, lol
[14:37] <Unit193> Registered and uploaded to mentors. :P
[14:37] <paultag> cool
[14:37] <paultag> email me the pointer to the .dsc or a vcs link
[14:37] <paultag> if you have any other information, that'd help too
[14:37] <paultag> my usual sponsorship guidelines are @ http://people.debian.org/~paultag/sponsorship
[14:38] <Unit193> Heh, thanks, I'll take a read!
[14:38] <paultag> but don't worry if you don't understand some of them, I'll clarify as needed
[14:38] <paultag> sure, Unit193 :)
[14:38] <paultag> sponsoring is one of my favorate Debian things
[14:38] <paultag> I try to do a lot of it
[15:24] <Cheri703> why would some OTHER guy being annoying stop YOU from doing something? If nothing else, they'd be like OMG SOMEONE ELSE, PLEASE DO THIS!
[15:24] <Cheri703> I'd think at least
[15:38] <skellat> Well, this sucks: http://ohiolmi.com/laus/ColorRateMap.pdf
[15:45] <Cheri703> I don't click on random pdf links....what is it?
[15:46] <skellat> The current unemployment rates breakdown by county
[15:46] <Cheri703> ah
[15:46] <skellat> Ashtabula isn't the worst BUT we still come in at 9%
[15:48] <skellat> Worst in the state is Pike County at over 11%
[15:53] <Cheri703> what's richland county?
[15:54]  * dzho always thinks of Montgomery Cty. being further north than it is.
[15:58] <skellat> Richland County is 7.6%...just barely below the US average
[15:58] <Cheri703> surprising
[16:00] <skellat> The bad part is that even with holiday hiring, our percentage in Ashtabula County went UP from November 2012
[16:05] <Cheri703> uuuuuuuuuggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh I hate my one monitor so much
[16:05] <Cheri703> it flickers and I hate it
[16:05] <Cheri703> I can't stand flickering lights when they're in the ceiling, let alone staring at one >_<
[16:06] <skellat> Are you able to go buy a new one?
[16:08] <Cheri703> I'd been holding off in case I have to buy a new computer, but it is driving me nuts. usually it evens out after ~5-10 minutes, but it's been over 30 min and still doing it >_<
[16:10] <Cheri703> also because at the point that I buy ONE new monitor, I'm probably going to just bite the bullet and buy TWO new monitors
[16:13] <skellat> Have you applied percussive maintenance?
[16:14] <Cheri703> it's an old monitor, I am assuming that the fluorescent backlight is going out
[16:14] <Cheri703> considering that I got it ~2 years ago for $38 in a thrift store, I'm not complaining at the life I got from it. it's a 20" 16:10 dell monitor
[16:23] <skellat> Ah
[16:28] <Cheri703> I just can't keep staring at a flickery screen. I get headaches just being in rooms with flickery overhead lights. Today is especially bad for the monitor :( Might have to modify my amazon order
[16:28] <paultag> :(
[16:38] <Cheri703> paultag: here you go: http://www.tomshardware.com/news/AOC-i2757fh-IPS-borderless-HDMI,18078.html
[16:38] <paultag> swag
[16:39] <Cheri703> That would be NUTS to go from a 20" and a 19" to TWO 27" :D :D
[16:39] <Cheri703> I'd be like O_O all the time
[16:40] <Cheri703> also: $300
[16:40] <paultag> :D
[16:40] <Cheri703> Yeah...if it is vesa compliant (haven't checked) this might be my next monitor(s)
[16:41] <Cheri703> hmm...does not look like it so far, let me keep checking
[16:42] <Cheri703> D: "Its really attractive looking and even though it doesn't have VESA mounts"
[16:43] <Cheri703> this one does though: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236103
[16:43] <Cheri703> not borderless
[16:48] <Cheri703> either my optic nerve has burned out or the flickering has finally stopped/eased. >1 hour after powering on the monitor. If it goes to sleep for more than a few minutes, the process will start again D:
[16:55] <Cheri703> ah, nope flickering just sped up a lot
[18:29] <thafreak> I'm so f**ckin' tired of java apps...
[18:29] <thafreak> seriously
[18:29] <thafreak> my brain is melting...
[18:29] <thafreak> stupid xml configs...
[18:30] <paultag> +1
[18:30] <thafreak> oh, and facebook sucks too
[18:30] <thafreak> I used to be able to look at lists of "friends" grouped by the groups I made up
[18:30] <thafreak> now it's just one big freaking pile...
[18:30] <thafreak> have to scrol through over 100 people to find ones to remove...then you remove them and the whole list refreshes...IN A DIFFERENT ORDER
[18:31] <thafreak> so I have to scan the entire list AGAIN...
[18:31] <thafreak> took way to long to remove like 19 people...
[18:31] <thafreak> and what's up with it leaving people in my friends list who deactivated their accounts...what's the point in that?
[18:31] <Cheri703> thafreak: sometimes easiest to just search and unfriend from their actual profile
[18:32] <thafreak> well, part of my problem, I don't really know who's on my list...
[18:32] <Cheri703> gotcha
[18:32] <thafreak> part of the need to purge
[18:33] <thafreak> probably could/should have purged more...
[18:40] <andygraybeal_> is rolling releases a good thing?
[18:57] <jandrusk> If the process is clean.
[18:58] <jandrusk> I think if they are using the same QA process it should work.
[19:01]  * skellat lowers periscope on IRC, returns to driving in the bad weather where it is still snowing in Ashtabula...
[19:07] <andygraybeal_> cool
[19:07] <andygraybeal_> can i expect never to 'distro-upgrade' ever again?
[19:07] <andygraybeal_> or whatever it is called
[19:07] <andygraybeal_> i mean, if that happens?
[19:07] <Unit193> It's just a thought at this point.
[19:07] <paultag> well
[19:07] <paultag> not quite
[19:08] <paultag> dist-upgrade doesn't upgrade the suite exactly
[19:08] <paultag> and Debian's been doing this in sid / unstable / testing for years (like, 20+)
[19:08] <Unit193> paultag: And I did actually get the right email, right?
[19:08] <paultag> dist-upgrade is sometimes needed for unstable with big things

[19:08] <paultag> Unit193: I did get your mail, but I've not ack'd it yet :)
[19:08] <paultag> I need to sit down with my mail after work
[19:09] <paultag> I need to finish slides for a talk tom. afternoon
[19:09] <paultag> but I should be able to give it a quick lookover, you're about #3 in the queue
[19:09] <Unit193> paultag: Heh, you should have seen -motu, bit funny.  Na, just making sure I got the right one. :)
[19:09] <paultag> heh :)
[19:09] <paultag> yep! totally! :)
[19:09] <paultag> btw, Unit193, for future uploads, http://mentors.debian.net/ is awesome
[19:09] <paultag> also helpful to get used to dput :)
[19:10] <paultag> but yep, all set, no need to push it there yet
[19:10] <Unit193> Been getting used to it with launchpad, put it on mentors once but should update that one.
[19:11] <paultag> kk :)
[20:54] <Cheri703> if I want to try out kubuntu, xubuntu, and lubuntu, should I go with 12.04 or try 12.10? I reverted to 12.04 with vanilla ubuntu because 12.10 had issues.
[20:55] <paultag> (Debian!)
[20:55] <Cheri703> point me at the best version of debian to try as well then
[20:55] <Cheri703> I'm going to make my new 32gb microSD card into a multi-boot liveUSB, so...I'm trying a bunch of stuff
[20:56] <Cheri703> what is the best for multiple monitor setups? Anything more/less friendly with them?
[20:56] <Unit193> Lubuntu doesn't do an LTS, Xubuntu got Xfce 4.10 in 12.10, and testing or Sid. ;)
[20:56] <Unit193> :D
[20:56] <paultag> testing++
[20:56] <paultag> also unstable++
[20:56] <Cheri703> ok, stable stable stuff
[20:56] <Cheri703> I don't want to constantly be fiddling with junk
[20:56] <paultag> stable is too stable
[20:56] <Unit193> Xubuntu works pretty good, just install arandr to setup.
[20:56] <paultag> an Ubuntu LTS is roughly similar to Debian testing
[20:56] <Cheri703> for ME, for NEW things to play with, stable is GOOD
[20:57] <paultag> Debian Stable will literally never break, but it's old
[20:57] <Unit193> But Debian stable is stale.
[20:57] <paultag> so not great for new hardware
[20:57] <paultag> Debian Stale! :)
[20:57] <Unit193> ...I randomly read it as that.
[20:57] <paultag> it's a common joke
[20:57] <paultag> Cheri703: http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/
[20:57] <paultag> Cheri703: if you want 64 bit linux
[20:58] <paultag> there's also 64bit Debian kFreeBSD
[20:58] <paultag> but linux might be easier on your hardware
[20:58] <Cheri703> paultag: is there a torrent of the debian version?
[20:58] <Cheri703> if I get debian will I have to get all new variations of software than what I'm used to using?
[20:58] <Cheri703> because that is a rabbit hole I do NOT want to go down
[20:59] <Unit193> Cheri703: I have a multi-boot flash, very nice.  I didn't go with full desktops as much, though.   Custom respin of Xubuntu is on the other flash (and no cheap way, the chroot method to respin)
[20:59] <paultag> Cheri703: of the stable releases, I think, but that link is the updated testing one
[20:59] <paultag> Cheri703: hum? no?
[20:59] <paultag> Ubuntu is Debian
[20:59] <Cheri703> ok, I dunno what stuff works on what
[20:59]  * Cheri703 hasn't been in the "try new stuff" realm for a while
[20:59] <Cheri703> do I really need 8 cds worth?
[21:00] <Cheri703> or do I download one of them?
[21:00] <Unit193> Except, Ubuntu has more closed type stuff, mp3 and such.
[21:00] <Unit193> (And real firefox)
[21:00] <Unit193> Easy to get netinst and install Xfce.
[21:02] <paultag> no, just the first, Cheri703
[21:02] <paultag> the others are an entire dump of the archive
[21:02] <paultag> in case you don't have internet
[21:04] <Cheri703> gotcha
[21:04] <Cheri703> I was hoping it was just one!
[21:04] <paultag> there's also a netinst cd
[21:04] <paultag> but that might be harder
[21:04] <paultag> oh and none of these have nonfree wifi drivers
[21:04] <paultag> you need some udebs to do that
[21:05] <Cheri703> for now this is just desktop so wifi is not an issue
[21:05] <paultag> kk
[21:14] <Cheri703> ugh, just got to a semi-stopping point on work project, so now I can play with this stuff for a bit
[21:15] <paultag> https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/184618_437180606353412_2035887196_n.jpg
[21:15] <Cheri703> I saw that, is it referring to something specific, or just in general?
[21:15] <paultag> Ⓐ
[21:18] <Cheri703> well, I guess the yoga bit..like is there something that says you can't do yoga AND smash the state?
[21:19] <paultag> it's tough :)
[21:20] <Cheri703> :( I like torrents better than direct downloads
[21:20] <Cheri703> I had 3.5MB/s on torrents and am getting 232KB/s on debian download
[21:26] <Cheri703> uuuuuggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh paultag, I might have to abandon debian just for slow download time
[21:26] <paultag> no patience
[21:26] <Cheri703> NOT WHEN I AM PAYING AS MUCH AS I AM FOR INTERNET!
[21:26] <Cheri703> that is the whole point!
[21:26] <paultag> why not use a netinst, then?
[21:27] <paultag> that's a 41 meg download
[21:27] <Cheri703> besides, OS isos are like the ONE time I can legitimately torrent things!
[21:27] <paultag> try this, Cheri703 - http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/wheezy_di_beta4/amd64/iso-cd/debian-wheezy-DI-b4-amd64-netinst.iso
[21:27] <Cheri703> I mean..the ONLY time I torrent, because obvs I wouldn't be doing illegitimate torrenting >_>
[21:27] <Cheri703> paultag: but I'm going to make a liveUSB, will that work with it?
[21:28]  * paultag shrugs
[21:28] <paultag> I assume so
[21:28] <paultag> I think youc an dd that into an usb disk
[21:28] <paultag> like actually
[21:28] <paultag> because of magic
[21:28] <Cheri703> that sounds like more work than I'm willing to do
[21:28] <paultag> but I don't know
[21:28] <paultag> o.O
[21:28] <paultag> that's less work then making a live cd
[21:28] <paultag> erm, usb
[21:28] <Cheri703> eh

[22:42] <thafreak> Well, just applied to another job on campus that I'm probably under qualified for
[22:43] <thafreak> just hope word doesn't get back to my boss...that'd be awkward
