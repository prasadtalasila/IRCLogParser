[00:23] <erenilson> can anyone help me??
[00:23] <stlu> Is there a way to force apt-get to remove all dependencies of the packages I want to purge?
[00:23] <ActionParsnip> Schumi24: if you run:  sudo apt-get update     is it smooth?
[00:23] <stlu> This is the tutorial I am trying to follow: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12469027#post12469027
[00:23] <jrib> stlu: apt-get autoremove   (in theory :))
[00:23] <nabblet> erenilson, i had a similar problem with my wireless card - since ubuntu 12.04 - it was no problme under 10.04
[00:24] <ActionParsnip> bianca: what game are you trying to launch?
[00:24] <bianca> League of legends
[00:24] <stlu> jrib: that will only install the old linux headers from the last update.
[00:24] <Schumi24> That worked. Thanks ActionParsnip  :D
[00:24] <jrib> stlu: what?
[00:24] <stlu> *that will only remove ...
[00:24] <k1l_> stlu: do it the other way. first install mate and then remove unity
[00:24] <Schumi24> I really gotta change the default nick, I made a typo when I entered it
[00:25] <erenilson> I installed ubuntu 12.10, is to fix this problem?
[00:25] <gunarm_> what does it mean when my server that I ssh into every day suddenly says "The autheticity of host can't be established"  Did something expire or am I getting hacked?
[00:25] <ActionParsnip> bianca: did you patch wine?
[00:25] <jrib> stlu: it will only work if the dependencies were installed *automatically* because you manually installed some other package
[00:25] <gunarm_> it gives the ECDSA finger print and asks if I want to continue as if it was a new server
[00:25] <stlu> kll_ I did install MATE, it has no effect on my problem, apt-get wanted to install 100MB+ of KDE packages and libs - this is not Kubuntu, its mainstream ubuntu
=== Schumi24 is now known as Schumi23`

[00:28] <stlu> sorry, its this tutorial: http://askubuntu.com/questions/6302/how-can-you-remove-unity
[00:29] <Falados_> Having a problem booting 12.10.  It seems once it runs initrd the system reboots - no errors. Any way to see what's going on?
[00:29] <ActionParsnip> Falados_: have you tested your ram?
[00:30] <Falados_> ActionParsnip, no have not tested ram.  Had 12.04 Kubuntu installed before with no issues.
[00:30] <ActionParsnip> Falados_: its a good starting point
[00:30] <Falados_> ok I'll try that.  If that isn't the problem - is there any other next step?
[00:31] <Falados_> ActionParsnip, I also have my root fs on LVM, if that makes a difference.
[00:31] <stlu> Is there a way to discover the packages that rely on others in a system?
[00:32] <fbdystang> I just installed an server instance, but I keep getting incorrect password attempts. Is there a way to find out my password?
[00:32] <stlu> That way I could add them in and then there wont be any reason to install the extra crap.
[00:32] <nabblet> problem solved http://blog.schmidt.br.com/2012/04/installing-dyndns-inadyn-as-service-on.html
[00:32] <dr_willis> fbdystang:  not really. normal method would be use recovery mode or a livce cd and reset the password to a known one.
[00:33] <LiThiuME3> Hmm quick question should : iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 58846 -j ACCEPT     forward port and accept connection from the port 58846
[00:33] <jrib> stlu: apt-cache depends?  apt-cache rdepends?  I'm not sure what you are actually doing.

[00:34] <fbdystang> dr_willis: is there a way I can just get to be root to fix?
[00:34] <dr_willis> wachpwnski:  you wouldent use startx to start a loginmanager like slim
[00:34] <k1l_> wachpwnski: no not startx
[00:34] <dr_willis> fbdystang:  recovery console from the grub menu
[00:34] <erenilson> quit
[00:34] <stlu> jrib: I am removing the packages listed on this tutorial, so that MATE won't conflict with Unity or Gnome3 daemons. http://askubuntu.com/questions/6302/how-can-you-remove-unity
[00:34] <ActionParsnip> fbdystang: www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/resetpassword
[00:34] <wachpwnski> k1l_:  How do I configure Cinnamon with startx then?
[00:34] <fbdystang> ActionParsnip: thnx :)
[00:34] <jrib> stlu: and?  what's the output?
[00:35] <k1l_> wachpwnski: start a desktopmanager and start cinnamon from there
[00:35] <jrib> stlu: also, are you sure you need to?  Why don't you just install mate?  What conflicts?
[00:35] <stlu> jrib: apt-get progressively wants to install more alternate packages as I try to remove them.
[00:35] <jrib> stlu: that's too vague
[00:35] <dr_willis> wachpwnski:  the login manager should show a listg including the available desktops
[00:36] <stlu> jrib: it got ridiculous and actually tried pushing KDE packages and libs on me when I tried to remove the Gnome3 ones.
[00:36] <k1l_> wachpwnski: as slim is in the repos why not installing slim? it should configure itself as the dm
[00:36] <wachpwnski> dr_willis:  how do I configure the login manager to start?
[00:36] <dr_willis> wachpwnski:  it should be doing that allready. unless you disabled it.
[00:36] <wachpwnski> k1l_:  I did, so I just reboot now?
[00:36] <jrib> stlu: does official mate documentation say you need to remove them?  Might be easier to just leave the alternate desktop and not use it
[00:36] <wachpwnski> dr_willis:  this is a server install
[00:37] <dr_willis> wachpwnski:  shouldent matter. you install the lightdm or whatever dm and it sets up as a service
[00:37] <jrib> stlu: see here: http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/download
[00:37] <stlu> Official MATE documentation will probably end up being modified by me for Ubuntu -specific problems.
[00:38] <jrib> stlu: what do you mean?  They have ubuntu-specific directions there
[00:38] <wachpwnski> dr_willis:  it is saying "failed to load session "ubuntu"
[00:38] <stlu> gnome-settings-daemon, for one, will crash the mate-settings-daemon and all icons and styles will be missing.
[00:38] <dr_willis> wachpwnski:  what is saying that
[00:38] <jrib> stlu: so don't run it?  Is mate running gnome-settings-daemon for some reason?
[00:39] <stlu> jrib: the ubuntu-specific documentation does not take these problems into acount. I will probably be the only one who updates it.
[00:39] <wachpwnski> dr_willis:  when I login with slim
[00:39] <dr_willis> wachpwnski:  select a differnt desktop   to use from the login manager screen
[00:40] <stlu> jrib: that isn't the only problem.  I'll spare you the details but the bottom line is, I can't wate for Mubuntu to materialize, I need Unity and Gnome3 OUT.
[00:40] <jrib> stlu: have you actually verified that it's still a problem?  For example here http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-mate-desktop-environment-in-ubuntu-12-04precise11-10-oneiric.html there is mention of conflicts with gnome being fixed
[00:41] <wachpwnski> dr_willis:  i think i have to link my session to cinnamon
[00:41] <stlu> jrib: that is the same documentation as in the MATE wiki.  I don't think many users have actually tried it because there are lots of unsolved problems even with the current version 1.4
[00:41] <dr_willis> wachpwnski:  i would hope that cinnamon adds a proper .desktop entry for the login managers to use.. if not - i wouldent put much faith in cinnamon

[01:08] <ubuntuapps> how do i promote my app?
[01:08] <justmeh> cjae, yup
[01:08] <cjae> justmeh: http://www.dumpt.com/img/viewer.php?file=7qp4ntjoxodv4k0let07.png
[01:09] <seamus_> pcspkr and snd_pcsp are already blacklisted and not running, but I still get beeps.
[01:09] <justmeh> ok
[01:09] <justmeh> then set the ip explicitly, with a /32
[01:09] <justmeh> that would only give it one ip to choose from..
[01:10] <justmeh> and gateway shouldnt matter as long as the machines making requests were on the same /24
[01:10] <justmeh> but perhaps you should ping the freenas doods?
[01:10] <cjae> right
[01:10] <cjae> dont know what you mean by a /32
[01:11] <cjae> give an ip instead
[01:11] <MarasLy> m√Ωnayim bura ne ya

[01:11] <seamus_> They don't happen in the terminal, but xchat's message prompt, chromium's url, and system settings prompts all beep loudly if I press backspace or left at the end. This is especially painful when browsing and listening to music, as the beep is far, FAR louder than the music.
[01:11] <justmeh> good google search: "gnome samba slow freenas" no quotes
[01:12] <cjae> right like cidr
[01:12] <justmeh> yes
[01:12] <ActionParsnip> seamus_: in sounds, I belive there is a bell volume
[01:12] <justmeh> so if it zeroconf's to an ip in that range then setting it to a /32 is effectively giving it a static ip
[01:12] <justmeh> if instead that's an ACL it could break it
[01:12] <justmeh> (like an allowed hosts setting)
[01:12] <cjae> ok
[01:13] <seamus_> In settings, under sound, there are five tabs: Output, Input, Hardware, Sound Effects, and Applications. Sound Effects has an alert volume option, but it is already muted.
[01:14] <seamus_> And in alsamixer, Beep is muted and set to zero.

[01:15] <justmeh> would also do it with a double tab doing a bash tab complete with multiple matches
[01:15] <seamus_> Also, for some reason, changing the default alert sound more than once causes the settings program to crash....

[01:17]  * justmeh is do'ing it
[01:17] <seamus_> pcspkr is already blacklisted. 'modprobe -r pcspkr' doesn't do anything and 'rmmod pcspkr' raises an error saying the proc doesn't exist.

[01:19] <ActionParsnip> Kajover: not sure, sorry
[01:19] <confused_> I have two drives I could erase and put ubuntu and windows on each, or its better just dual boot one drive?
[01:19] <justmeh> then try toggling the setting in alsamixer
[01:19] <Kajover> thank you anyway
[01:19] <confused_> alsamixer, I will look that up
[01:20] <ActionParsnip> confused_: i'd put ubuntu on the same drive as windows, then have a shared ntfs area for user data on the other drive as well as an ntfs partition for pagefile and %tmp% then a partition for swap

[01:21] <Annette01> Im trying to install ubuntu on my computer, but when i run the live usb both to install, and run off the usb it freezes after a ton of command line stuff
[01:21] <Annette01> Ive tried three usb sticks, all differnt sizes and brans

[01:22] <Annette01> i also disabled the ufei thing in the bios
[01:22] <seamus_> "Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS \n \l" Sorry, I know I said 12.10 earlier. I'm helping a friend fix this machine and forgot he wanted the LTS....
[01:22] <blkadder> We'd need the error message in order to help...
[01:22] <ActionParsnip> Annette01: did you MD5 tes the ISO you downloaded?
[01:22] <blkadder> Or at least I would. :-)
[01:22] <seamus_> It's an odd set-up for an old machine. Installed Lubuntu to get around a compatibility issue with the CPU, then put GNOME 3 over it, but he runs GNOME Classic.
[01:22] <ActionParsnip> seamus_: did you look in sound settings, there is a bell volume
[01:23] <Annette01> Im not super in the know. But what is a md5 test?
[01:23] <ActionParsnip> !md5 | Annette01
[01:23] <ubottu> Annette01: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[01:23] <seamus_> There doesn't appear to be such a thing in sound settings, in any of the five tabs or any of the lists inside those..... However, I may have solved it by disabling something in alsamixer called "external amplifier". Let me test real quickly.
[01:23] <Annette01> Thanks ^_^
[01:23] <Annette01> Ill look here!
[01:24] <seamus_> Nope. It turned off all sound.
[01:24] <seamus_> Turning it back on leaves me with the same problem.
[01:24] <Sgt_Shultz> seamus_, change keyboard or maybe look in BIOS to see if "beep on error" is on, it maybe a hardware thing
[01:25] <seamus_> Ok. Can't change keyboards, since it's a laptop, but will check BIOS.
[01:25] <Annette01> IT says the checksums are differnt, what does that mean?
[01:25] <Annette01> oh wait
[01:25] <Annette01> i missed a step
[01:26] <seamus_> Though, would it be a hardware thing if it sounds like the default alert sound? Like someone strumming some weird metallic but not-instrument string thing. xP
[01:26] <seamus_> Not like a pure tone or harsh generic beep. Just way too loud.
[01:26] <ActionParsnip> Annette01: different hashes means the image is corrupted

[01:28] <seamus_> Oddly, it throws an error at me if I try "xset -b off", suggesting the syntax is "xset -b b off". Neither command helped though. :/

[02:26] <BeefTaco> I have an external drive mounted at /media/username/MediaDrive. What I want to do is create a user called Friends that will have ONLY read and execute permissions on a couple of folders on this drive via ssh. How do I do this?
[02:26] <escott> BeefTaco, is the external drive NTFS?
[02:26] <mox> Hola
[02:27] <BeefTaco> escott: Yes, I made sure not to set it up as FAT32 when I formatted it.
[02:27] <escott> BeefTaco, then what you propose is impossible
[02:27] <linux_is_my_hero> micmic: io non parlo italiano, ma Google Translate fa. quando si dice che non pu√≤ entrare nel sortcenter, vuoi dire il menu cruscotto?
[02:27] <BeefTaco> escott: Even if it is being ssh'ed into from an NTFS system?
[02:28] <escott> BeefTaco, to some extent what you propose is impossible even with a proper partition. depends on whether or not you accept chroot jails as a legit solution
[02:28] <BeefTaco> escott: What are chroot jails?
[02:28] <micmic> ma su canaIe ita non mi caga nessuno
[02:28] <escott> BeefTaco, NTFS is not POSIX. you cannot enforce POSIX permissions on it, hence you cannot apply different posix permissions to the same NTFS mountpoint
[02:29] <BeefTaco> escott: Meaning that the permissions cannot be set per user?
[02:29] <micmic> softwarecenter
[02:29] <escott> BeefTaco, there is one fake set of permissions per NTFS mountpoint.
[02:30] <micmic> aiutami Iinux
[02:30] <escott> BeefTaco, on top of that you have noexec and a host of other annoyances
[02:31] <escott> BeefTaco, assuming you switch to a proper posix filesystem then you could attempt a chroot jail but these days i would recommend a virtual machine over a chroot jail
[02:31] <micmic> heIpppppppppppppppppppp
[02:31] <BeefTaco> escott: What about a way to allow access to entire drive regardless of permissions? Would simple ssh do this?

[02:32] <micmic> si, apre Ia pagina ma poi non mi fa connettere
[02:33] <escott> BeefTaco, one thing you need to understand is that a user only exists on a system to the extent that they can run binaries. For example when I ssh into another machine I *am* /bin/bash
[02:34] <ActionParsnip> linux_is_my_hero: there are lots of channels for lots of languages :)
[02:34] <BeefTaco> Okay, that makes sense. Guess what I am try to do then is create a "restricted" user.
[02:34] <escott> BeefTaco, so removing execute permissions from someone is also a way to deny them access. you could copy /bin/bash and libc and some other basic necessities into a folder and chroot them to that, but (a) its a very limited environment (b) its hard to update (c) its security is no greater than what you copy to that directory
[02:35] <micmic> heIppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
[02:35] <BeefTaco> escott: Limited environment is what I want. The whole purpose is to allow friends to access content on the drive remotely.
[02:35] <escott> BeefTaco, my recommendation if you wanted to give access to someone who you didnt trust would be to consider either an sftp jail (which means they can only upload/download) or a virtual machine (so you can trash the whole thing/start over if it gets compromised)
[02:35] <BeefTaco> Or have me access it on the restricted user from their house.
[02:35] <linux_is_my_hero> micmic: hai provato a spostare il computer a un altro collegamento ad internet? forse alcune porte sono bloccate.
[02:36] <ActionParsnip> micmic: what is the issue?
[02:36] <BeefTaco> escott: What is a good vm environment for ubuntu 12.10?
[02:36] <escott> BeefTaco, the NTFS thing just makes stuff more complicated because you dont have real permissions on those files (you cannot change them except for the entire disk at a time)

[02:37] <micmic> si vede che carica ma non si coIIega
[02:37] <micmic> mi da iI simboIo e basta
[02:38] <escott> hoechts, you might be able to play around with udev rules
[02:38] <hoechts> escott, where can i find more about this? i dont know udev
[02:38] <linux_is_my_hero> wifi come rete dati cellulare (4G), o come hotspot wifi coffee house?
[02:39] <xangua> !it | micmic linux_is_my_hero
[02:39] <ubottu> micmic linux_is_my_hero: Vai su #ubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie! (per entrare, scrivi ¬´ /join #ubuntu-it ¬ª senza virgolette)
[02:39] <micmic> suI canaIe in itaIiano non mi risponde nessuno
[02:40] <micmic> aItrimenti non sarei qui, non sono idiota
[02:40] <escott> hoechts, you can see some rules in /etc/udev/rules.d otherwise just look at man udev
[02:40] <hoechts> do you know if i can stop rebuilding an array which i have started manually?
[02:42] <micmic> sono anche suI canaIe itaIiano in questo momento
[02:42] <escott> hoechts, you can just stop the array
[02:42] <hoechts> escott, and then?
[02:42] <linux_is_my_hero> micmic: hai provato google translate? allora si pu√≤ provare camere in molte lingue tra cui inglese :-)
[02:42] <escott> hoechts, and then hopefully it is stopped
[02:43] <hoechts> and how do i start it? there is data on that raid ;)
[02:43] <hoechts> i dont like loosing this data
[02:43] <escott> hoechts, stopping and starting an array does nothing to the data inside it
[02:43] <hoechts> it cost me 3 days to copy the data to that raid ;)
[02:43] <micmic> adesso ci provo, sperando bene
[02:43] <hoechts> escott, ok then i try it ;) good to know i have backups ;)
[02:44] <ULO> I tried 12.10 (full install) the other day dual boot w/ W7 and it ran like ass. My machine can run W7 just fine (everything is snappy and fast) but for some reason 12.10 is meh. Should I go back to 12.04 or should I just install 13.04 as my daily driver (I plan on using it just for fun). Are there any nagging bugs?
[02:45] <ActionParsnip> ULO: what video chip do you use?
[02:45] <ULO> ATI 5400
[02:45] <hoechts> escott, thank you! mdadm --assemble --scan now mounted my raid on /dev/md1 - like i wanted ;)   i check what happens after a reboot
[02:46] <ULO> ActionParsnip:  Radeon HD 5450
[02:46] <ULO> 512MB
[02:46] <ActionParsnip> ULO: did you install the proprietary video driver
[02:47] <randimiller> Any suggestions for a linux mmorpg? bored and looking for a new game to play
[02:47] <ULO> ActionParsnip: Yup. Loading programs and switching from programs was really slow too. Logging into Ubuntu (compared to 12.04) was extremely slow.
[02:48] <ActionParsnip> randimiller: http://mmohuts.com/editorials/linux-mmorpgs
[02:48] <ActionParsnip> ULO: tried a different desktop, like xfce?
[02:49] <ULO> ActionParsnip: Yeah, I tried it and it runs a better. I'd like to keep using Unity though :S
[02:50] <fbdystang> ULO: Install android. hehe j/k
[02:50] <Mamo-chan> wee... more kubuntu errors.. It wont allow me to set images i download to desktop background.
[02:50] <Mamo-chan> Any thoughts? :(
[02:50] <ActionParsnip> Mamo-chan: asked in #kubuntu
[02:50] <hoechts_> :/ my raid is always starting as /dev/md1 when i reboot although i wrote /dev/md1 in mdadm.con :/
[02:50] <ULO> fbdystang: Already got a Nexus 4 & 7 for that ;)
[02:51] <Mamo-chan> heh.. ok
[02:52] <escott> hoechts_, have you run an update-initramfs?
[02:52] <hoechts_> escott, ill try it
[02:52] <ULO> How is 13.04 running? Any weird experience breaking bugs?
[02:52] <ActionParsnip> ULO: is this an upgrade from Precise?
[02:52] <escott> !ubuntu+1 | ULO
[02:52] <ubottu> ULO: Raring Ringtail is the codename for Ubuntu 13.04 - Support only in #ubuntu+1
[02:52] <ActionParsnip> ULO: #ubuntu+1 for Raring
[02:53] <hoechts_> escott, hmm im not sure what option i should give this command ;) .. -u?
[02:53] <ULO> ActionParsnip: It was a clean install
[02:53] <hoechts_> i dont know initramfs either ;)
[02:53] <ActionParsnip> ULO: works ok here but my hardware is super Linux friendly
[02:53] <escott> hoechts_, i always have to check... -a i think helps
[02:53] <ActionParsnip> ULO: I know the xorg in Quantal hates 2xxx 3xxx and 4xxx ATi GPUs and there is a PPA with a fix, may help you
[02:54] <ULO> ActionParsnip: Yikes. I'd like to give the PPA a try :) Where can I find it?
[02:55] <ActionParsnip> ULO: http://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/how-to-install-amd-catalyst-legacy.html
[02:58] <hoechts> escott, thank you very much - it worked! Now i will kill my old raid. cu
[03:03] <seamus_> There was no BIOS option I could tell was making it buzz. It doesn't seem to matter what I do. I can't get rid of this alert sound. Also, it seems the sound is actually more of a gong.
[03:08] <seamus_> So, I'm getting gong-like alert noises whenever I backspace or scroll too far in a text bar. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on an old Dell Latitude D600. The sound settings dialog doesn't include a terminal bell checkbox or slider of any kind, pcspkr module is not running, AlsaMixer's Beep volume is at 0% and muted, and my BIOS only mentions one keyboard-related beep option, and it is disabled.
[03:08] <halp-pl0x> hello
[03:08] <halp-pl0x> i have a minor problem
[03:08] <halp-pl0x> and can probably be fixed very easily
[03:08] <ActionParsnip> seamus_: what if you set the sound scheme to none?
[03:09] <seamus_> My sound settings dialog doesn't mention any scheme or theme -like options. Can I do that by terminal?
[03:09] <halp-pl0x> how do i change the network interface "wlan0" to have a static ip? when i edit /etc/../interfaces  and set it up there, terminal tells me it "failed to bring up wlan0"
[03:10] <ActionParsnip> seamus_: http://toastytech.com/guis/ubuntu10sounds.png   like that
[03:10] <ipank> hello
[03:11] <ipank> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1561522/
[03:11] <ActionParsnip> halp-pl0x: in network manager -> wired tab, click the wired connected and set it to manual
[03:11] <ipank> I can't boot into windows partition
[03:11] <ActionParsnip> halp-pl0x: you will need to set the name servers too
[03:11] <thetinyjesus> Is there a way to get an iphone to sync with ubuntu yet?
[03:12] <thetinyjesus> I noticed in the new ubuntu development video he's wearing the apple headphones so i figured theres a trick to get it to sync
[03:12] <ipank> can anyone help me?
[03:12] <stlu> halp-pl0x: I beleive you need the wpa-supplicant to provide a Passphrase to your wireless router in order to manage the wifi from the command line.
[03:12] <ipank> !grub
[03:12] <ActionParsnip> ipank: what happens when you try to boot WIndows?
[03:12] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[03:12] <ipank> ActionParsnip, no, the windows 7 is not listed
[03:13] <thetinyjesus> do the restore grub link, happened to me as well
[03:13] <seamus_> The sound effects tab contains "Alert Volume", with a slider and on/off switch (set to "off"), and a selector labeled "choose an alert sound" with five options (set to "default").
[03:13] <ActionParsnip> ipank: if you run:   sudo update-grub    do you see Windows mentioned?
[03:13] <seamus_> Nothing else.
[03:13] <stlu> I'm still needing assistance removing Unity in 11.10.  Jrib?
[03:13] <ipank> ActionParsnip, no
[03:13] <ipank> ActionParsnip, it just generic kernell, recovery, and memtest
[03:13] <ActionParsnip> stlu: Oneiric is EOL in April. Is it worth it?
[03:14] <stlu> Yes, because f***ing dell won't use newer versions and I just bought a laptop from them.
[03:14] <seamus_> The other options are "Bark", "Drip", "Glass", and "Sonar".
[03:14] <seamus_> There is no "none".
[03:15] <stlu> Plus, my bet is it will be just as nasty with 12.04 or 12.10.
[03:15] <thetinyjesus> stlu: Samsung is the WORST computer manufacturer in the world
[03:15] <ActionParsnip> stlu: I recommend upgrading to 12.04, it is LTS so supported til April 2017
[03:15] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: I'd say Acer
[03:15] <stlu> Well if I can't do it here then it wont work in 12.04.  this is apt-get I am fighting with.  http://pastebin.com/2JU2BUtq
[03:15] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: My samsung laptop was purchased in august this year, and they will not support windows 8
[03:16] <ipank> any help?
[03:16] <ActionParsnip> stlu: if you simply install xfce4 or another desktop, you will get a new session to log in at the login screen
[03:16] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: do you want windows 8?
[03:16] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: no drivers at all, thats why im desperately looking for a way to transfer songs to my iphone
[03:16] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: i thought i did, upgraded and found out no drivers work
[03:16] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: didnt think a brand new laptop with an I7 wouldn't work
[03:16] <stlu> Action-Parsnip: I am perfectly happy using TTY1, all I want is Unity and the crud gone. http://pastebin.com/2JU2BUtq
[03:17] <joseneto> My display driver is not working as a result my computer is really slow, please help
[03:17] <ActionParsnip> stlu: then uninstall xorg and the other apps will fail deps and when you use autoremove it will haul the rest of the stuff off
[03:18] <BillyZane> thetinyjesus: i know that out of principal, a new laptop should be windows 8 compliant, but do you think you would really need windows 8 over 7? i personally prefer 7, unless you have a touch screen monitor
[03:18] <BillyZane> then again, i have not tried windows 8, maybe it's really cool
[03:18] <seamus_> In fact, my whole desktop doesn't really look like the one in that picture. It is much plainer. Let me put up a screenshot.
[03:18] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: of course i didn't think i needed it but it's always fun to play around with new software and now im stuck and cannot transfer songs to my iphone
[03:19] <halp-pl0x> i have another question, why isnt my computer's ip adress showing up in my routers list? my router is showing that something is there (showing a mac address, but no name or ip adress). and im still able to access the internet from my computer???????
[03:19] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: os in this case
[03:19] <BillyZane> thetinyjesus: i recommend just sticking with 7 and if you want to try a new OS, try a linux OS if you haven't already, or maybe a BSD flavor
[03:19] <bean> halp-pl0x: have you rebooted your router?
[03:19] <halp-pl0x> yes
[03:19] <BillyZane> oh wait, i'm in #ubuntu, n/m you already have
[03:19] <eamon> what do I do if I forgot my sudo password?
[03:19] <bean> halp-pl0x, then your computer probably has a DHCP lease from before the reboot.
[03:20] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: i have windows 8 and ubuntu partitioned, windows 8 has ruined that partition and the only thing i ever used windows for was for syncing the iphone
[03:20] <halp-pl0x> bean: how to i renew it?
[03:20] <bean> halp-pl0x: it doesn't really need to be in your lease list
[03:20] <joseneto> My display driver is not working as a result my computer is really slow, please help. Acer aspire 5532 ATI Radeon HD3200. HELP!!
[03:20] <halp-pl0x> oh okay
[03:20] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: and i know how time consuming it would be to downgrade to windows 7 without screwing up the linux partition
[03:21] <BillyZane> thetinyjesus: i wouldnt use 8 even if i could :P
[03:21] <eamon> I forgot my sudo password; what do I do?
[03:21] <halp-pl0x> well also, i recently reinstalled windows on my computer, and it destroyed the grub menu,(it doesnt eve show it) and boots straight to windows. how do i fix that?
[03:21] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: neither would i it sucked for the few minutes it worked
[03:21] <stlu> ActionParsnip: I'll take you up on that.  Don't go anywhere.
[03:21] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: to be fair the week it worked and then suddenly all the drivers went haywire
[03:21] <BillyZane> thetinyjesus: wow that sucks
[03:21] <seednode> Not sure what's going on here, but I kinda like Win8
[03:22] <eamon> How do I reset the password?
[03:22] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: im just in disbelief that with 100 million + iphones no one has figured out how to sync them up to ubuntu the most popular distro
[03:22] <kion> eamon: you need to log in with a live disk and reset it from there
[03:23] <bean> halp-pl0x: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[03:23] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: and as far as i know isn't apple based of unix? idk why it would be so difficult
[03:23] <BillyZane> thetinyjesus: i'm starting to regret even having an iphone/ipad. there's too much baggage
[03:23] <halp-pl0x> ty bean
[03:23] <eamon> kion, what is the command?
[03:23] <BillyZane> thetinyjesus: because unix and linux are free, and apple is slavery
[03:23] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: well after owning an HTC Hero, HTC Evo, Galaxy SII/SIII I've given up with androids
[03:23] <seednode> BillyZane, tell me about it. I just use a dumbphone now
[03:24] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: all the same crap, the battery life is horrible and after a month the phone just simply sucks
[03:24] <BillyZane> the phone slows down to a crawl.
[03:24] <BillyZane> yeah, my ihphone 4 should not be this slow
[03:24] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: are you running ios 6 on it? that is probably why it started to run slow with even ios 5
[03:24] <BillyZane> thetinyjesus: what's wrong with androids?
[03:25] <BillyZane> no, i'm running iOS5, i wouldn't dare use 6
[03:25] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: battery life/ running slow after a month
[03:25] <linux_is_my_hero> lets not forget that sometimes poorly programmed apps can kill a phone no matter what os its running
=== c_smith is now known as c_smith_afk
[03:25] <BillyZane> thetinyjesus: but if the battery didn't slow, would it be ok?
[03:25] <linux_is_my_hero> *cough* facebook
[03:25] <BillyZane> linux_is_my_hero: i gotta delete some apps then
[03:25] <BillyZane> i have a 32gig iphone with 100mb free space
[03:25] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: not going to lie i just don't like them, even on the SIII the touch screen wasn't as responsive, the apps load slower,
[03:26] <stlu_> ActionParsnip: the good news is 'apt-get remove xorg' isn't trying to install OS/2 or some nonsence.  Nothing would surprise me anymore.
[03:26] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: youtube videos still have difficulty loading on google's own phone and probably the worst part is the fragmentation, everyone has their own software except if you get googles phone
[03:26] <BillyZane> thetinyjesus: i wish phones were more like PCs. where i can just install my own OS. i heard about that ubuntu OS. that sounds interesting
[03:26] <linux_is_my_hero> billyzane: its not anything you did.  the apps just keep getting bigger no matter what phone you have.  i had to delete some apps too.
[03:26] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: i looked into it, looks awesome obviously right now it's slow if you watch the demo videos but it has potential
[03:27] <XMLnewbi> so I'm failing to get nginx to work. Trying to go back to apache. I did a sudo apt-get install apache2           but there is no folder apache2 in the etc folder now
[03:27] <stlu_> ActionParsnip: now what - "suduo apt-get autoremove" ?
[03:27] <XMLnewbi> I need to figure out how to backup a clean install so I can restore it when I get myself in trouble like this
[03:27] <Keshav> HI guys
[03:28] <thetinyjesus> BillyZane: my problem with with owning android phones is unless you choose google's nexus phone or whatever they call it now, don't expect to get their lasted OS for months IF  ever
[03:28] <Keshav> I wanted to install cinamon on ubuntu 12.04 using cli
[03:28] <Keshav> How should I proceed
[03:28] <bean> Keshav what is cinnamon
[03:28] <Keshav> I have the ppa, but not the steps
[03:29] <Keshav> Desktop environment
[03:29] <thetinyjesus> cinnamon is a window manager
[03:29] <Keshav> for ubuntu
[03:29] <Keshav> anybody using it?
[03:29] <thetinyjesus> i am but i'm also running mint 14
[03:29] <spizzo> cinnamon? I'm using it on mint
[03:29] <stlu_> ActionParsnip: nothing is auto-removing >:|
[03:29] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: i did install it on ubuntu 12.04 with no problems
[03:30] <eamon> is the sudo password the same as the root password?
[03:30] <spizzo> I'm reading up on apt-get commands and wondering why upgrade exists since the only difference between that and dist-upgrade seems to be smarter dependency resolution.
[03:30] <stlu_> 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove...
[03:30] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: if you want it sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable
[03:30] <thetinyjesus> then sudo apt-get update
[03:31] <spizzo> eamon: root password should be the password for the root account, sudo password should be the one for whichever account you're using.
[03:31] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: followed by sudo apt-get install cinnamon
[03:31] <eamon> spizzo: this is ubuntu, there is no root account‚Ä¶
[03:32] <eamon> So I don't know if that guide will work‚Ä¶
[03:32] <kion> eamon no, it is not the same, but gives you the same potential
[03:32] <eamon> ( http://en.kioskea.net/faq/3457-gentoo-linux-restoring-the-root-password )
[03:32] <stlu_> eamon: sudo gives you the same level of authority *as if* you were root.  Just add sudo before any commands in your tutorial.
[03:33] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: did you have a question on cinnamon or what?
[03:33] <stlu_> Keshav wants a cinnamon install tutorial
[03:33] <Keshav> yea
[03:33] <Keshav> Following your instructions downloading the package :)
[03:33] <eamon> would editing /etc/shadow from a livecd work?
[03:33] <joseneto> I cant install ati Radeon HD3200 on ubuntu 12.10 .Please HELP!!!!
[03:33] <kion> eamon
[03:33] <joseneto> acer aspire 5532 3GB
[03:33] <eamon> kion
[03:34] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: oh :P btw you should like it, been using it for a while with not a single crash yet, the last version had tons of bugs but not this one
[03:34] <kion> Go on a live cd and se the command sudo passwd USER
[03:34] <kion> where user is your lost password user
[03:34] <stlu_> eamon: if you are trying to change the root password then you haven't got it.
[03:34] <Keshav> Okay, never had this repository
[03:34] <stlu_> eamon: you only need your user password in Ubuntu.
[03:34] <Keshav> And is mint 14 a desktop environment or an altogether different OS?
[03:35] <LiThiuME3> should : iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 58846 -j ACCEPT     forward port and accept connection from the port 58846
[03:35] <ActionParsnip> joseneto: the xorg in quantal hates your gpu
[03:35] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: as far as i know its not different from ubuntu but i could be wrong i never really researched it that much, i think they use different file managers
[03:35] <joseneto> :(
[03:35] <Keshav> I see
[03:35] <ActionParsnip> joseneto: there is a fix
[03:35] <ActionParsnip> joseneto: http://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/how-to-install-amd-catalyst-legacy.html
[03:35] <Keshav> btw do you type my name each time? Or is there a reply button on right click :|
[03:35] <spizzo> mint is another OS, but it is strongly related to ubuntu
[03:36] <joseneto> ActionParsnip
[03:36] <thetinyjesus> i type Kes and press tab
[03:36] <stlu_> Lithiume3: ACCEPT only allows the connection to your computer.  You need to make further changes to forward it to a second machine.
[03:36] <tonsofpcs> k<tab> = Keshav
[03:36] <joseneto> what do i do?
[03:36] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: for me its probably thet tab
[03:36] <Keshav> hmmm
[03:36] <ActionParsnip> joseneto: read the link I gave, why do you think I went and got it?
[03:36] <Keshav> When I Press tab it shows all the names starting with t
[03:36] <Keshav> Fiddling around
[03:36] <joseneto> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh sorry
[03:36] <Keshav> should get it
[03:36] <joseneto> :0
[03:36] <joseneto> :)
[03:36] <Keshav> tonsofpcs,
[03:36] <Keshav> got it looks like
[03:36] <tonsofpcs> Keshav:
[03:36] <FloodBot1> Keshav: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:37] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: theti TAB should be enough
[03:37] <LiThiuME3> stlu_ it's on my VPS I have Deluge running with a daemon on the for 58846 I cant connect from my home computer, So if I understand well i need to apply other commands in order to forward the port?
[03:37] <Keshav> yeah
[03:37] <Keshav> thetinyjesus :
[03:37] <Keshav> Phew
[03:37] <tonsofpcs> theti tab should pay for my drinks
[03:37] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, should pay for my drinks
[03:37] <Keshav> what, no, it shows comma after thetinyjesus!
[03:38] <thetinyjesus> lol
[03:38] <thetinyjesus> im broke unless the hartford insurance hires me after our phone interview
[03:38] <Keshav> lol :D
[03:38] <tonsofpcs> thetinyjesus: well, hopefully they hire you.  we need drinks :)
[03:38] <thetinyjesus> :P
[03:39] <pepee> anyone having problems with USB devices in 12.10?
[03:39] <thetinyjesus> tonsofpcs: ever drink some johnny walker blue label ?
[03:39] <tonsofpcs> thetinyjesus: not that I can recall.
[03:39] <stlu_> Lith: no, if you are trying to connect to a service on the same VPS then you only need to accept.  Forward would only be used to go from your VPS, to another VPS for example.
[03:39] <thetinyjesus> tonsofpcs: its friggin amazing
[03:39] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, after following the three commands, cli stopped downloading packages, so guess its time to restart?
[03:39] <nearst> hi all
[03:39] <Keshav> Or should I see the change without restarting the system
[03:39] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: you might be able to just log out and change environment if it doesnt work than yah have to reboot
[03:40] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Okay
[03:40] <tonsofpcs> ever spit 151 into a fire and had it light back close enough to your face that people think you set your eyebrows on fire?
[03:40] <Keshav> lol
[03:40] <LiThiuME3> stlu_ Ok thanks for the answer I guess I was looking at the wrong "solution" for my problem
[03:40] <thetinyjesus> lmao never drank 151
[03:40] <LiThiuME3> Thanks
[03:40] <thetinyjesus> i enjoy whiskey
[03:40] <stlu_> Lith: no problem, I figured that out back when I wanted to make a computer into a router.

[03:42] <stlu_> I removed xorg your silly suggestion.  How do I automatically get rid of all the higher level dependant packages?
[03:42] <stlu_> "autoremove" does not show any candidates.
[03:42] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: I remember the early CS betas etc, great times
[03:42] <nearst> cs 1.6
[03:43] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: hell yah dude, never in my life have i went to a LAN party other than once for counter strike tournament best time ever playing a game
[03:43] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: where the Ts were short sleved versions of the CTs
[03:43] <kewel> which is faster on an old machine running lubuntu, chrome or firefox?
[03:43] <nearst> cs and dota
[03:43] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: where did cs_industry go :(
[03:44] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: no idea, i wonder if anyone still plays 1.6.. source ruined it

[03:45] <stlu_> Action...
[03:47] <thetinyjesus> no way people actually still play counter strike ?? i might have to install steam
[03:48] <Keshav> Ofcourse people play it a lot
[03:48] <Keshav> Well, Cs Go is catching steam right now
[03:48] <joseneto> ActionParsnip can i get corelDraw x6 working in ubuntu 12.10 how about adobe products?
[03:49] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: how's that cinnamon
[03:50] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Well, checking the settings, I do not see any difference in the interface, its weird, something's wrong probably
[03:50] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: do you know if you can play 1.6 with an integrated graphics card on laptop? nvidia 310m
[03:50] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: yeah the interface should be completely different
[03:50] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Ofcourse you can
[03:50] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, No there is no change in interface :o
[03:51] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: damn.. hmm did you reboot too?
[03:51] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, hmmm
[03:51] <joseneto> can i get corelDraw x6 working in ubuntu 12.10 how about adobe products?
[03:52] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: im looking into that, strange someone else said that happened to them and if they login with guest cinnamon looks perfect
[03:52] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Its loaded, maybe I should check, what I was expecting to change
[03:52] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: unity should be gone :P
[03:52] <Keshav> maybe
[03:53] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Trying to login via Guest lets see what happens
[03:53] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: okay
[03:55] <guest-tXq38B> thetinyjesus, looks like I don't know what should change :P
[03:56] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, nothing changed lol
[03:56] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, time to switch to youtube video
[03:56] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: hmm yeah ill watch some too save you some time
[03:57] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: cinnamon isn't supported here, it may also cause issues as its  3rd party package
[03:57] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: ugh 2nd video exact same way i showed you
[03:58] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, No its ok, I'll try and help myself
[03:58] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: i've gotten it to work perfect on ubuntu
[03:58] <ActionParsnip> Keshav: just install xfce4 package and log off, log in to the xfce session
[03:58] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: its still 3rd party, so there is no real way of knowing it will fly
[03:58] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: the packages in the official repo are tested and are known to work
[03:59] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: could it have something to do with them switching to nemo file manager?
[03:59] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: no idea, sorry
[04:00] <Keshav> ActionParsnip, you mod?
[04:01] <kion> When I upgraded to 12.10, my google earth was gone!   I downloaded the .deb and when I run it, the software manager says it is of bad quality. Has anyone had this problem?
[04:01] <ActionParsnip> Keshav: mod what?
[04:03] <stlu_> ActionParsnip: I reported your suggestion to a Ubuntu Admin.  I know how to fix that but I don't know how to stop you from being a jerk.
[04:04] <stlu_> Have a nice day
[04:04] <thetinyjesus> lol

[04:05] <pyro254750> anybody have any experience with internet connectivity issues on the client side of openvpn?
[04:05] <PhatTony> Nothing to fear but fear its self
[04:05] <kion> ActionParsnip: you are not a jerk, actually thanks for all your help and effort that you put in supporting Ubuntu!!!! I am with you,
[04:06] <thetinyjesus> i didnt see actionparsnip say one negative thing
[04:06] <dah81> Hi all, I've tried the forums and searched the zillions of topics on the issue but I am still stuck and wondering if anyone can help me get my NVidia GT 520 working in either 12.04 or 12.10?
[04:07] <kion> dah81: have you tried installing Nvidias Drivers?
[04:08] <dah81> yes, tried nouveau and nvidia proprietary
[04:08] <dah81> from x-swat and from nvidia.com
[04:09] <kion> dah81: it is not complicated, 1st you download the latest driver from Nvidia,      2nd you make it executable,     3rd you switch to a tty ctrl+alt+f1    4th  sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm stop  5th sudo sh NVIDIA_Driver_Naem
[04:09] <dah81> yup, that's what i tried
[04:09] <kion> dah81 6th you reboot
[04:09] <dr_willis> and hope it worked.
[04:09] <dah81> i get to reboot, and it just loads a blank aubergine coloured screen
[04:10] <kion> strange I usa an NVIDI GTX 260M and it works
[04:10] <dr_willis> tried the nomoseset option?
[04:10] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Bingo!
[04:10] <dah81> yes, nomodeset tried
[04:10] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: got it?
[04:11] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, It worked :D Didn't do that interface change thing at the logon screen, Yeah!
[04:11] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: lol
[04:11] <dah81> as well as various other grub options found on the net and forums
[04:11] <kion> dah81: the same driver has an uninstall option
[04:11] <kion> try uninstalling it
[04:11] <kion> and re installing
[04:11] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: thats the best part, it it doesnt work as planned or you dont like it you just switch back to unity
[04:11] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Thanks a lot mahn :D
[04:11] <kion> dah81: I am guessing
[04:12] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: glad it did, you can customize tons of stuff on it too
[04:12] <Keshav> Yeah, will do that :D
[04:12] <reb_> hi
[04:13] <rdsm> hi
[04:13] <avickery> Need advice on best command line diff tool to integrate with git
[04:13] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, One query, any way to find out the  total memory used by the setup files in File system?
[04:13] <dah81> hmmm, k, I'll try it. If it doesn't work maybe I'll make a forum post detailing what I've tried and my setup and the results so far
[04:13] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, or specifically the drive on which ubuntu is installed
[04:13] <dah81> thanks for your help kion
[04:13] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: hmm, never even looked into that TBH
[04:14] <thetinyjesus> menu-admin-system info
[04:14] <kion> dah81: sorry I dont know more, I have been frustrated with my Nvidia card in the past
[04:14] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: seems to have quite a bit
[04:14] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, hmmm, switched to Ubuntu from Win last week, doesn't look like I'll switch back to Win again except for games
[04:14] <avickery> good boy
[04:15] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: i switched linux like 2 years ago, never use windows other than games/ transferring songs to iphone
[04:15] <reb_> i'm having trouble with my CDs.  ubuntu wont read them
[04:15] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, hmm
[04:15] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: do all your torrenting on linux and even use as media server
[04:15] <dr_willis> reb_: what kind of cd
[04:15] <rdsm> After a kernel panic on a Sony Vaio Duo , The keyboard is not responding even on the bios, any one knows if the keyboard on this machine needs a specific driver on the UEFI boot files? The original boot partitions were overwritten by ubuntu during install process.
[04:16] <reb_> normal -R CD
[04:16] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: i also made a 3rd partition on mine, one that both windows and linux reads so all my downloads are visible on windows as well
[04:16] <Keshav> Didn't try making this as media server, however as of torrenting, when the net gets dc, the files go corrupt :\
[04:16] <dr_willis> reb_: try mounting them by hand
[04:16] <reb_> it works when i boot up in windows
[04:16] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, yea even I did that
[04:16] <reb_> it just wont read them otherwise
[04:16] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: nice dude, best way to do it
[04:17] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: did you try menu> admin> system info for what you were looking for
[04:17] <Keshav> Oh wait
[04:19] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, No, why, I didn't find system info in admin!
[04:19] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: hmm maybe that's just a mint thing im not sure where that option is for ubuntu, it shows your filesystem and memory usage
[04:19] <kion> How do I get rid of the guest account?
=== ke5pcv is now known as ke5pcv-away
[04:19] <dr_willis> reb_: try mounting them by hand. look for error messages
[04:20] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Okay maybe
[04:20] <reb_> it's kinda hard to make a Linux live CD when it says please insert CD when ever i try to add files
[04:20] <kion> Keshav what info are you looking for?
[04:20] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Any suggestions for torrent files? They go corrupt, sometimes, if the net gets dc
[04:20] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: really even with transmission ?
[04:20] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Yep!~
[04:21] <Keshav> kion system info, that is the memory used by the partition on which ubuntu is installed
[04:21] <dr_willis> reb_:  that made no sence.. add files where?
[04:21] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: does the same thing happen if you close transmission and re open it?
[04:21] <kion> Keshav I am trying to remember the command for that, unfortunately I left my Ubuntu laptop at office
[04:22] <reb_> i want to make a Linux live CD but every time i try putting anything on the CD it says there's nothing there
[04:22] <dr_willis> reb_:  you mean you are trying to  burn an ISO file to a cd?
[04:22] <reb_> yes
[04:22] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Yea, unfortunately it won't do the integrity check either, so I have to re download the torrent everytime and make it read the downloaded files
[04:23] <dr_willis> that wasent what you were asking earlier,
[04:23] <kion> Keshav try fsck -l
[04:23] <kion> on a terminal
[04:23] <dr_willis> reb_:  what burner app are you trying to use
[04:23] <reb_> just the normal file
[04:23] <Keshav> kion, did that, it open settings for repair

[04:29] <itsrachelfish> ...why
[04:29] <itsrachelfish> okay how about this
[04:29] <kion> keshav if you type "man -k partition" it should give you a list of commands that have the word partition on their manual pages
[04:29] <itsrachelfish> I want a simple command line temperature monitoring program

[04:36] <itsrachelfish> rdsm: thank you for the watch -n tip
[04:36] <itsrachelfish> :)
[04:36] <itsrachelfish> that's exactly what I needed
[04:36] <itsrachelfish> #useful
[04:36] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: at bottom incomplete check keep incomplete torrents in: and select whatever folder you want
[04:37] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: start a download wait till it gets to like 5 megs or 10 megs w/e close program
[04:37] <kion> itsrachelfish: I would just cat the /proc file contaning the temperature your are looking
[04:37] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: when you reopen right click the torrent and verify local data

[04:38] <Daxter> er wrong app. darnit
[04:38] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: its definitely working for me doing it that way, every time i reopen transmission its paused and i just have to re verify the data and its back to where it was
[04:39] <fred-fri> rdsm: thanks, i ran that and entered my password but now it looks like that terminal froze lol
[04:39] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Okay, checking it
[04:39] <selite> How do I install sun's java?
[04:39] <fred-fri> rdsm: the caret is blinking but i get no new prompt
[04:40] <Daxter> hey i messed up my java install somehow when I tried upgrading to java7 via webupd8's ppa for it. now minecraft won't run (except in a VM) :(. Any ideas?
[04:40] <rdsm> fred-fri, the nc is now listening on port 25 until you close that program , run telnet in other terminal and it will connect
[04:40] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: i noticed i loose like 5-10 megs my guess is maybe instead of having corrupt data it backtracks itself a little bit
[04:40] <fred-fri> rdsm: ok
[04:41] <grim4593> I have used gsettings to move my minimize, maximize, and close buttons to the right side of the screen. However, when the window is maximized the buttons jump back to the left. Is there a way to fix this?
[04:41] <fred-fri> rdsm: cool thanks
[04:41] <rdsm> fred-fri, glad to help.
[04:42] <dr_willis> grim4593:  no. since the buttons are part of the global menu stuff. and not part of the window after you  maxamize

[04:46] <b1lly> when downloading packages, I always get confused -- is there an easy way to tell which ones I need
[04:46] <b1lly> sometimes it asks for my "architecture" etc, and theres always different versions
[04:47] <cfhowlett> b1lly, use software center
[04:47] <elky> cfhowlett, they quit on their own
[04:47] <cfhowlett> elky, so I see.
[04:47] <cfhowlett> b1lly, "architecture" asks if you're on a 32 or 64 bit machine
=== dankest|away is now known as dankest
[04:47] <Daxter> soupwell: I don't remember why, but if there is a LAN conflict with addys and your VPN, the computer will always try to connect to whoever has the address on the LAN your on, not your VPN
[04:48] <b1lly> cfhowlett: so amd64 is 64 bit and i386 is 32
[04:48] <cfhowlett> b1lly, correct
[04:48] <Daxter> the easy trick is to set your 3rd octet to something that isn't default (eg 192.168.SETTHIS.blah)
[04:48] <rdsm> cfhowlett, I haven't thought about that but if I need to do it I'll take it to technical service tomorrow , sony created that mess machine , I'll let sony handle it... thanks tor the tip anyway :)
[04:49] <soupwell> Daxter: does that mean I'm SOL if I'm on a LAN that conflicts with my VPN? It seems like this would be a common enough problem that there would be a workaround
[04:49] <cfhowlett> rdsm, best of luck.  don't tell them *ubuntu* or they will likely claim a warranty violation
[04:49] <soupwell> ah
[04:49] <soupwell> thanks
[04:49] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, it won't work

[04:50] <soupwell> argh, I was hoping not to have to restructure the home network
[04:50] <Daxter> soupwell: yes you are SOL till you can get back to your lan and change your addressing. As far as a workaround I dont knwo of any
[04:50] <rdsm> cfhowlett, Oh, I'll delete the partitions before, (their rescue utility already erased one of them for me anyway...) , thanks again.
[04:50] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, No you did not understand, if I would download the torrent again, it would verify the cache, but suppose if a torrent while downloading, the net gets disconnected, then the downloads cannot be started from the same torrent file
[04:50] <soupwell> thanks for the input. I'll see if I can get it done via ssh

[04:52] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Is there any way to save torrents?
[04:52] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Instead of directly allowing them to open in Transmission or another client?
[04:53] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: i cant seem to get magnet links to work on linux to be able to save as
[04:53] <TheLordOfTime> Keshav, right click the link, save target as, <save> ?
[04:53] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: some websites i go to allow that option but like piratebay never has that
[04:53] <thetinyjesus> TheLordOfTime: its grayed out on most sites
[04:53] <TheLordOfTime> thetinyjesus, screenshots or lies, its worked for me for eons
[04:54] <thetinyjesus> TheLordOfTime: okay ill screen shot
[04:55] <dr_willis> greying out the save as? i think theres extensions to get around that. ;)
[04:55] <Keshav> TheLordOfTime, no it won't save :o
[04:56] <Keshav> TheLordOfTime, btw am using firefox
[04:56] <thetinyjesus> TheLordOfTime: is there a reason i cant take a screenshot with right click option open
[04:56] <rdsm> Keshav, there are firefox add-ons to get the .torrent from the magnet, googled here and found one called magrent. but I never used it...
[04:57] <TheLordOfTime> Keshav, there's probably extensions to get around that.  I've never had issues with it, but i don't use piratebay.  for anything.
[04:57] <thetinyjesus> TheLordOfTime: im using chrome and it wont allow me to either
[04:57] <thetinyjesus> and it comes up with this message under the link
[04:57] <thetinyjesus> Problems with magnets links are fixed by upgrading your torrent client!
[04:58] <Keshav> yep it says that, and to go awy with it, it requires to download some another crappy browser

[04:59] <Keshav> Open software center> All softwares Type xmonad in search bar, check if you have it

[05:00] <b1lly> rdsm: ok, great, where can I configure it

[05:03] <Keshav> Sgt_Shultz, it was about being able to save torrent files and not opening them directly in deluge
[05:03] <folorn> any idea how to see your ip information etc from the terminal ? i forget
[05:03] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: just found out something weird.. it depends on the torrent file itself i opened that torrent link in chrome and it worked too and tried "the hobbit" and there was no get torrent file option
[05:03] <xubuntu_> Has anyone else had issues with htop displaying certain threads using 100% when idle?
[05:03] <Sgt_Shultz> well firefox saves a copy in downloads, 4 me anyway
[05:03] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Download magrent addon in firefox,
[05:03] <Daxter> Somehow I messed up my java install when I tried upgrading to java7 from java6-openjdk via webupd8's ppa for java7. But now any JAva apps won't run, except in a VM. Any ideas?
[05:04] <pyro254750> folorn: try ifconfig
[05:04] <dr_willis> Daxter:  uninstall them all and reinsrtall the one you  want perhaps.
[05:04] <thetinyjesus> magnet fixer?
[05:04] <dr_willis> Daxter:  check what java you are using also.. java -version
[05:04] <ActionParsnip> Daxter: i suggest you contact the ppa maintainer
[05:04] <dr_willis> !java
[05:04] <ubottu> To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[05:04] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, magrent
[05:04] <folorn> thanks pyro254750
[05:05] <dr_willis> the webupd8 ppa is just a script  that does what i think the java factoid outlines.
[05:05] <fred-fri> rdsm: so if i telnet i get the output with your command
[05:05] <fred-fri> rdsm: my mail program seems to be able to open a connection to port 25 too, but i dont see any output produced
[05:05] <rdsm> fred-fri, if you telnet you will be sending information for the netcat application.
[05:05] <Daxter> i unistalled java7, but java6 isnt running right. java -version reports the OpenJDK, java 1.6
[05:05] <b1lly> rdsm: any "easier" window manager utilities like xmonad?
[05:06] <fred-fri> rdsm: right, but i actually want my mail program that im developing to connect to it
[05:06] <fred-fri> rdsm: which it does, i just dont get any output
[05:06] <fred-fri> rdsm: even though my mail program is sending stuff there
[05:06] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: yup works new option download .torrent file when right click
[05:06] <nebula> bhu123
=== Karl is now known as Guest49029
[05:06] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: nice one
=== nebula is now known as Guest11205
[05:07] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Say thanks to rdsm  :)
[05:07] <thetinyjesus> rdsm: you rock :D
[05:07] <Keshav> :po
[05:07] <Keshav> :P
[05:07] <rdsm> b1lly, what do you mean like xmonad? what kind of feature are you looking for?
[05:07] <b1lly> something to manage my windows
[05:08] <dr_willis> thats a little vague b1lly
[05:08] <b1lly> I want to be able to snap applications/windows to the left/right side of my screen easily
[05:08] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: did that fix your problem you were having
[05:08] <rdsm> b1lly, gnome...
[05:08] <b1lly> with keyboard shortcuts
[05:08] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Probably it should,
[05:08] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane: compiz has the grid plugin
[05:08] <Daxter> hmm now it seems to work. I don't knwo what to say...
[05:08] <pyro254750> billy, if you are running gnome you can use ctrl+alt+ left and right
[05:08] <pyro254750> compiz also has similar features
[05:08] <b1lly> pyro254750: that just switches my workspace
[05:08] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane: you can assign a shortcut key to it too (i belive)
[05:08] <b1lly> compiz doesnt seem to work on my machine for some reason
[05:08] <b1lly> even though I have it enabled
[05:09] <rdsm> fred-fri, you will receive the output of the connection on the terminal with netcat open , I don't remember eSMTP RFC from my mind, you should read the documentation regarding the protocol or install a smtp server on your machine.
[05:09] <pyro254750> ah you mean to snap the app from space to space?
[05:09] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: thats the benefit of linux always keeps your brain active :P
[05:09] <b1lly> sure
[05:09] <b1lly> yeah
[05:09] <b1lly> so if i had 2 apps open
[05:09] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, :P
[05:09] <b1lly> i can snap one to the leftside taking up 50% and one to the right side taking up 50%
[05:09] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, I just wanted even the games to work :D
[05:10] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, They would work with Wine but fps is comparatively lower as compared to win
[05:10] <rdsm> b1lly,  ctrl+super(windoze key)+ left/right
[05:10] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: sometimes its possible to get certain games to work but its hit or miss and a pain in the ass lol
[05:10] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, yea that is
[05:10] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, true
[05:10] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: theres not a lot of documentation on how to do it either
[05:11] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: like wine will work for a lot of games but the performance kinda sucks at least in my experience
[05:11] <pyro254750> billy: ctrl + alt + num will snap windows to left/right in varying sizes
[05:11] <b1lly> rdsm: the left and right dont work
[05:11] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Yeah, but wine does it flawlessly for some games I tried, Yeah the performance is low
[05:11] <b1lly> rdsm: only up and down (to maximzied)
[05:11] <b1lly> pyro254750: that don't work either
[05:11] <b1lly> I believe those are both "features" of compiz
[05:11] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Nevermind one or two quarters and we will have steam box for linux as well :D
[05:11] <b1lly> and like I said, compiz isn't working properly on my machine
[05:11] <pyro254750> ctrl + alt + num is a unity feature
[05:12] <b1lly> well it doesn't do anything on my machine
[05:12] <thetinyjesus> psh that would be great playing some CS on linux
[05:12] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, Then it would be possible to play games on ubunut too :D :P
[05:12] <pyro254750> whatchu talkin bout, its already possible
[05:13] <thetinyjesus> pyro254750: with good performance
[05:13] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, That torrent thing works great, now no corrupted files :P
[05:13] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: good deal man
[05:13] <pyro254750> yes, with good performance
[05:13] <thetinyjesus> pyro254750: have a guide for it? or is it just wine
[05:13] <pyro254750> its wine, but its not just simply launching with wine. youve gotta play with the settings
[05:14] <rdsm> b1lly, open system preferences , go to keyboard,  shortcuts tab , navigation option , you should be able to it there.
[05:14] <pyro254750> but after a bit of tweaking ive got wow running at 60fps+ on 3 screens
[05:14] <rdsm> *you should be able to set it there.
[05:14] <thetinyjesus> hmm going to have to look into this i wanna play some CS
[05:14] <Keshav> thetinyjesus, you stay in?
[05:15] <thetinyjesus> Keshav: huh?
[05:15] <Keshav> Vinius I meant to ask :)
[05:16] <pyro254750> thetinyjesus, im pretty sure there is a counterstrike port
[05:16] <thetinyjesus> pyro254750: looking into it now
[05:16] <b1lly> rdsm: that only allows me to setup controlling workspaces
[05:16] <thetinyjesus> pyro254750: i hope so :)
[05:17] <thetinyjesus> would you look at that, 14 hours ago Steam released Ubuntu Beta
[05:17] <pyro254750> I also seem to recall reading somewhere that valve was going to be doing alot with steam and linux, which should mean native for most of their games
[05:17] <thetinyjesus> it just came out for beta :)
[05:18] <dr_willis> the not so beta beta
[05:18] <thetinyjesus> whats that mean lol
[05:18] <pyro254750> probably that its buggy, lol
[05:19] <pyro254750> going to find out soon enough, dling
[05:19] <thetinyjesus> where the hecks the dl link lol
[05:19] <pyro254750> http://store.steampowered.com/about/
[05:19] <pyro254750> click install
[05:19] <thetinyjesus> nvm
[05:20] <thetinyjesus> i really hope its playable
[05:20] <thetinyjesus> it uses your normal steam account im assuming ?
[05:20] <pyro254750> yeah
[05:21] <thetinyjesus> going to have to get a new one its been like 8 years since i played CS
[05:21] <keshav_> thetinyjesus, Do you play kz?
[05:21] <thetinyjesus> keshav_: naw only played CS from steam
[05:21] <thetinyjesus> or you mean kill zone
[05:21] <keshav_> thetinyjesus, Kz = kreedz mod in CS, wonder you don't know it :o Bhop and climbing maps?
[05:21] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: Urban terror is a lot like couter strike, plus it has wall jumping :)
[05:22] <thetinyjesus> keshav_: naw man never played those damn i cant wait and is urban terror free?
[05:22] <rdsm> b1lly, sorry , you're right. my mistake, have you tried Ctrl + (Win key) + left or right , and it didn't worked?
[05:23] <pyro254750> it looks like they want you to pay for games again for linux version
[05:23] <rdsm> b1lly,  Are you using unity? what application are you trying to do it?
[05:23] <b1lly> rdsm: yeah, yeah
[05:23] <b1lly> well, any (even chrome)
[05:23] <rdsm> b1lly, ubuntu 12.10?
[05:24] <thetinyjesus> pyro254750: really dan
[05:24] <thetinyjesus> damn
[05:24] <ActionParsnip> keshav_: that kreedz mod looks like the jump levels from UT
[05:24] <keshav_> Btw anybody tried using any cleaning software? Like ccleaner for windows, does anything exist on similar terms for 12.04?
[05:24] <ActionParsnip> keshav_: bleachbit
[05:24] <keshav_> ActionParsnip, maybe, never played UT
[05:24] <keshav_> ActionParsnip, Thanks
[05:24] <thetinyjesus> mines still updating steam
[05:24] <pyro254750> yeah, all the games I have purchased on my account dont come up, but when i search for them they are "linux games" and they want like 20 bucks a peice for them, lol
[05:25] <pyro254750> I guess no native halflife on linux right now
[05:25] <thetinyjesus> jesus
[05:25] <ActionParsnip> pyro254750: it runs excellently in Wine
[05:25] <thetinyjesus> the games still cost 20 bucks?
[05:25] <keshav_> pyro254750, yep use wine!
[05:25] <b1lly> rdsm: i'm trying to use compiz to do any of the effects, but unfortunately not of them work
[05:25] <kewel> how to change lubuntu menu items to run chrome with flags? much thx
[05:25] <pyro254750> sounds good to me
[05:25] <dr_willis> hmm. my games showed a few weeks ago
[05:25] <rdsm> b1lly, oh you are using compiz?
[05:26] <ActionParsnip> keshav_: I recommend you make a copy of the file that launches it in /usr/share/applications   and then open it in gedit. You can then make your own options and so forth
[05:26] <b1lly> rdsm: I tried to use it, but it doesn't work for me
[05:26] <rubiconjosh> I remember reading you may have to pay for the same game for each operating system due to development costs for the porting
[05:26] <b1lly> rdsm: nothing compiz related seems to work
[05:26] <rdsm> b1lly, are you on ubuntu 12.10?
[05:26] <b1lly> yeah, the latest
[05:26] <dr_willis> kewel: find the chrome.desktop file copy it. customize it
[05:27] <kewel> dr_willis: sweet thanks!
[05:27] <ActionParsnip> keshav_: sudo cp /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop /usr/share/applications/my-google-chrome.desktop; gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/my-google-chrome.desktop
[05:27] <ActionParsnip> keshav_: ^
[05:27] <pyro254750> oh wait I see. when I search for it, it shows a price, but if you click on it then it tells you that you own it
[05:27] <rdsm> b1lly, hold down the super key , and see if a keyboard shortcuts list appear.
[05:27] <ActionParsnip> keshav_: sorry, wrong target
[05:27] <keshav_> ActionParsnip, Trying to understand
[05:27] <thetinyjesus> so everything is universal ?
[05:28] <rdsm> b1lly, the one you're looking for is supposed to be in the lower right of that list.
[05:28] <ActionParsnip> kewel ^   sorry
[05:28] <thetinyjesus> im willing to buy CS for linux but wanna make sure i can play on windows if it doesnt work
[05:28] <ActionParsnip> its been a long night
[05:28] <b1lly> i dont see keyboard shortcuts
[05:28] <b1lly> the super key is the "windows" key correct?
[05:28] <thetinyjesus> i lost all my old information
[05:28] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: yes
[05:29] <rubiconjosh> billy: did you hold the super key for at least three seconds?
[05:29] <rdsm> b1lly, exactly , you should hold it for a few seconds.
[05:29] <b1lly> ya
[05:29] <b1lly> nothing shows up
[05:29] <keshav_> ActionParsnip, how do I fine the file that launches it :|
[05:29] <b1lly> the only thing that shows up are numbers and stuff
[05:29] <b1lly> on my icons to the left
[05:29] <b1lly> aka my toolbar or w/e
[05:29] <keshav_> ActionParsnip, actually new to Ubuntu, installed it jsut a week ago
[05:29] <kewel> actionparsnip: cool .. checking it out ...
[05:29] <ActionParsnip> keshav_: I just gave you it. run the command in terminal
[05:30] <rdsm> b1lly, I guess these features are from compiz, unity uses it asbackend.
[05:30] <b1lly> yeah, but compiz doesn't work for me
[05:31] <b1lly> I can configure the settings
[05:31] <b1lly> but nothing I choose in it actually has any effecty
[05:31] <rdsm> have you restarted the graphical interface?
[05:31] <pyro254750> rdsm, i had those features on my laptop prior to compiz install, im pretty sure its a unity thing
[05:31] <keshav_> sudo cp /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop /usr/share/applications/my-google-chrome.desktop; gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/my-google-chrome.desktop
[05:31] <keshav_> what will the above command do? Is it one? Or any colons that differ it into two commands ActionParsnip
[05:32] <pyro254750> also, some apps will not allow the shortcut popup to come up, its best to click on the desktop and THEN hold down the super key
[05:32] <OptimizedCoder> In gdb, how do I redirect the o/p of a certain gdb command to a file (instead of stdout)?
[05:32] <ActionParsnip> keshav_: yes its all one, you can then edit the Exec= line as you wish, and the Display Name line, so that it appears differently in the menus
[05:33] <rdsm> pyro254750, ohh yeah, that's is true , you should try it b1lly. also have you tried restarting the graphical interface after config with compiz?
[05:33] <b1lly> rdsm: how do I do that
[05:34] <b1lly> rdsm: and yeah, I think I have video card issues or compiz is conflicting withs omething
[05:34] <rdsm> pyro254750, ctrl + alt + backspace still works?
[05:34] <b1lly> rdsm: is there anyway to check if compiz is working properly
[05:34] <keshav_> ActionParsnip, it opened two documents in gedit, thats it
[05:34] <rdsm> b1lly, compiz is not my strong point , maybe pyro254750 can help you better.
[05:35] <ActionParsnip> keshav_: it should only open one. the desktop file is what manages the menu items. you can then edit it as you wish. You need to make a copy or the updates will overwrite your efforts
[05:35] <pyro254750> rdsm, yes ctrl + alt + backspace works, but you have to enable it in keyboard layout options
[05:36] <b1lly> ctrl+alt+backspace doesnt do anything for me
[05:37] <kewel> cool it werked.
[05:37] <thetinyjesus> omfg i think i just found my old steam account
[05:37] <pyro254750> rdsm, you can also use sudo restart lightdm
[05:37] <rdsm> b1lly, sorry man I suggest asking on the channel I am not the best one to help with it , but certainly gnome fits your needs.
[05:38] <rdsm> b1lly, I suggest trying this command last informed by pyro254750
[05:38] <XMLnewbi> so I accedently edited my original default nginx config file.             I keep reinstalling nginx with sudo apt-get uninstall but files dont change back
[05:38] <b1lly> ;/
=== dark3n is now known as dark3n|off
[05:39] <kewel> √ü
[05:39] <rdsm> b1lly, sorry dude I am not god. :))
[05:39]  * kewel found the character map
[05:39] <b1lly> no doubt, thanks for effort
[05:39] <thetinyjesus> whattt counter-strike not available for linux steam??
[05:39] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: run:  killall -u $USER    and it will do the same
[05:39] <rubiconjosh> billy: I missed what your problem is. Compiz settings are not doing anything?
[05:39] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: i'd ask in the channel for the app
[05:40] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: what you mean?
[05:40] <pyro254750> billy, you should be able to get compiz settings up with ccsm
[05:40] <rdsm> rubiconjosh, shortcuts ctrl+super+left/right are not half-maximizing the app and holding super is not showing the shortcuts.
[05:40] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: well, this is the channel for ubuntu, is there a channel for steam?
[05:40] <Avinash> hi
[05:41] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: not sure theres a bunch of us figuring it out in here
[05:41] <ActionParsnip> pyro254750: ccsm is known to cause issues
[05:41] <keshav_> thetinyjesus, No there isn't one for linux
[05:41] <ActionParsnip> !alis
[05:41] <ubottu> alis is a services bot that can help you find channels. Read "/msg alis help list" for help and ask any questions about it in #freenode. Example usage: /msg alis list #ubuntu* or /msg alis list *http*
[05:41] <keshav_> thetinyjesus, That's why people suggested wine here
[05:41] <thetinyjesus> pyro254750: is it allowing you to install CS?
[05:41] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: try in  #ubuntu-steam
[05:42] <thetinyjesus> keshav_: im about to try wine
[05:42] <thetinyjesus> keshav_: soo excited i found my old CS account
[05:42] <pyro254750> thetinyjesus: no, so far the only one I can find thats linux compatible is TF2
[05:42] <keshav_> yea do that, the performance decreases is only 5-10%
[05:42] <Avinash> tnx
[05:42] <rubiconjosh> billy: What graphics card do you have?
[05:42] <keshav_> hi Avinash
[05:43] <Avinash> hi
[05:43] <rdsm> XMLnewbi, purge instead of uninstall will remove everything including the config files, but I guess that it's easier to find the default config file on google...
[05:44] <Ben64> How can I tell which DNS servers a system is currently using? (12.04)
[05:44] <b1lly> pyro254750: ccsm?
[05:44] <ActionParsnip> Ben64: nslookup bbc.co.uk     may show it
[05:44] <Nach0z> check /etc/resolv.conf
[05:44] <Nach0z> may or may not have a nameserver listed
[05:44] <thetinyjesus> pyro254750: any tips on using wine for steam?
[05:44] <rdsm> XMLnewbi, just installed nginx here, I can send you the default .conf at pvt if you want.
[05:44] <Ben64> ActionParsnip: nice, thanks
[05:45] <pyro254750> billy: ccsm is the compiz config settings manager. I personally havent had any issues with it, but actionparsnip indicated that it is known to cause issues
[05:45] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: why wine for steam, there is a native app
[05:45] <thetinyjesus> ActionParsnip: counter-strike isn't part of the native app
[05:45] <ActionParsnip> pyro254750: Billy: there is a warning now when you first use it
[05:45] <ActionParsnip> thetinyjesus: i see
[05:46] <Ben64> thetinyjesus: steam works really well on wine, i never had a problem with it
[05:46] <pyro254750> thetinyjesus: counterstrike should be capable of running independant of steam direct from the .exe. If i were going to try it with wine, thats how I would do it
[05:46] <XMLnewbi> sure just pastebin it plz
[05:46] <keshav_> Ben64, +1
[05:46] <njd001> i have a stupid user question if i download ubuntu 12.10 desktop will it contain ubuntu liveCD ?
[05:46] <rdsm> XMLnewbi, include my nickname when talking to me , otherwise it's hard to see your answer.
[05:47] <rubiconjosh> b1lly, What graphics card or graphics chipset do you have?
[05:47] <rdsm> XMLnewbi, just a sec, I'm on a fresh install here, no plugin at vim to pastebin.
[05:47] <pyro254750> njd001: the 12.04 cd has an option to boot as a live cd, the 12.10 should as well
[05:47] <njd001> excellent
[05:47] <b1lly> well, I have an nvidia graphics card
[05:47] <b1lly> but I couldn't get it to work properly
[05:47] <rubiconjosh> b1lly,  Which one and which driver?
[05:47] <njd001> my friend here at work said i can use clonentfs to clone the local disk image of the physical disk
[05:47] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: pyro254750 http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/01/should-ccsm-be-purged-from-the-ubuntu-repos :)
[05:47] <b1lly> so I think it's using the onboard graphics
[05:48] <rubiconjosh> b1lly, I have a gtx760 that worked before and after I installed the latest nvidia driver
[05:48]  * njd001 wants to make the corporate image his vm within ubuntu 12.10 :) as i had asked earlier apparently clonentfs will do this :D
[05:48] <rdsm> XMLnewbi, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1561761/
[05:48] <b1lly> rubiconjosh: I tried installing latest drivers and it gave me a lot of trouble
[05:48] <rubiconjosh> b1lly,  If you launch the details program and look under graphics what does it say?
[05:48] <njd001> not sure if you guys use a knowledge bot but thats a good one to add clonentfs
[05:49] <b1lly> rubiconjosh: Driver
[05:49] <b1lly> rubiconjosh: Experience: Standard
[05:49] <jeeves_moss> how can I import the e-mail folder files from my dovecot server back into thunderbird so I can push them to my exchange server?
[05:49] <pyro254750> actionparsnip: very intersting, I guess I havent flipped the self destruct switch yet, lol
[05:49] <rubiconjosh> b1lly, which nvidia card do you have? and what onboard graphics chipset?
[05:49] <njd001> pyro254750 one other good point to ask this laptop im installing on has both nvidia and intel video cards (independent) which one should i make ubuntu 12.10 use?
[05:49] <cloudgeek> i am running a program from shell in python ,triangle.py ,i write it in vim and also make it executable but it is giving wrong answer ,but on a online compiler it's giving correct answer! so help me
[05:49] <b1lly> I think a geforce gt 435m or 420m
[05:50] <b1lly> one of the
[05:50] <b1lly> i think its the 420
[05:50] <rubiconjosh> b1lly, lspci | grep VGA
[05:50] <ActionParsnip> cloudgeek: i'd ask in #python
[05:51] <pyro254750> njd001: while im no expert, I suspect that the nvidia will require a proprietary driver installed while the intel will not. If you dont plan to do much 3d rendering (gaming), then I would let ubuntu pick what it wants. otherwise, id use the nvidia.
[05:51] <b1lly> 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 18)
[05:51] <b1lly> 02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 0df1 (rev a1)
[05:51] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: is the system a laptop?
[05:52] <njd001> pyro254750 its a work laptop and im not much of a gamer ;-)
[05:52] <b1lly> yeah
[05:52] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: oh then you want bumblebee
[05:52] <njd001> but great insight thanks!
[05:52] <rubiconjosh> Oh, you have the optimus setup
[05:52] <zykotick9> b1lly: do did need to use lspci -v to get both cards to output like that right?
[05:52] <b1lly> rubiconjosh: yeah, I remeber reading about that somewhere
[05:52] <rubiconjosh> b1lly, I have never configured that, the m at the end of the card name should have tipped me off
[05:52] <pyro254750> njd001: in that case I would just let ubuntu pick its own drivers. Either card should have more than enough for what you are doing. I have an older laptop running with compiz, and its very smooth, all using built in ubuntu drivers
[05:52] <njd001> pyro254750: I have a thinkpad T430
[05:52] <thetinyjesus> so far so good steam seems to be installing cs through wine perfect
[05:52] <b1lly> zykotick9: no
[05:53] <zykotick9> b1lly: interesting, thanks.
[05:53] <b1lly> ActionParsnip: what is bumblebee
[05:53] <rubiconjosh> b1lly, sorry I do not know anything about the optimus setup other than installing the regular nvidia driver will not work and will probably cause X to not run
[05:54] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: its a project to accomodate switchable GPUs using nvidia (aka Optimus)
[05:54] <b1lly> is it on software center?
[05:54] <ActionParsnip> !optimus
[05:54] <ActionParsnip> !bumblebee
[05:55] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee
[05:55] <cloudgeek> ActionParsnip: can i use the above /env/python like same
[05:55] <ActionParsnip> cloudgeek: I don't code python, sorry
[05:55] <MichaelP> What is better for a live usb stick ext2 or fat32 ?
[05:56] <ActionParsnip> MichaelP: fat32 is advised in the guides
[05:56] <b1lly> ActionParsnip: ok, installing
[05:56] <MichaelP> ActionParsnip, okthanks
[05:56] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: bumblebee is far from perfect
[05:56] <dr_willis> MichaelP:  the live tools will normally wan tto use fat*
[05:57] <rdsm> cloudgeek, if your script is running but the result output is wrong probably your code is wrong , check if the indent correct, but here is not the best place to ask.
[05:59] <kewel> well peeps, I got my PIII 1GHz 512MB up and running with lubuntu 12.04 .. had to use an old version of flashplugin, but it can youtube and run libreoffice ..
[06:00] <ActionParsnip> kewel: awesome
[06:00] <kewel> =)
[06:00] <ActionParsnip> kewel: I'd use minitube for youtube, its less taxing on the CPU
[06:00]  * rdsm remembers when p4 came out and p3 was better.
[06:01] <kewel> actionparsnip: cool.  I'll look into it
[06:01] <kewel> how do I get ubuntu 10.04 off of sda1?
[06:02] <kewel> delete the partition and then stretch this one?
[06:02] <rubiconjosh> kewel: before you delete a partition to remove linux make sure your boot loader is not getting its config file from that partition
[06:02] <b1lly> bumblebee great sucess
[06:02] <b1lly> thanks alo0t
[06:03] <ActionParsnip> kewel: its an option, you may have to rejig Grub if it uses the partition to store the configs
[06:03] <b1lly> OS runs really slow but
[06:03] <rdsm> b1lly, hooray!
[06:03] <b1lly> it worked lol
[06:03] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: use:  optirun firefox     to make the app use the nvidia gpu and not the Intel one
[06:03] <kewel> rubiconjosh: thx
[06:03] <kewel> actionparsnip: thx
[06:03] <b1lly> ActionParsnip: how do I do that
[06:03] <b1lly> in terminal?
[06:04] <xrs> i deleted a 3 GB folder to free up some space (deleted as root) its not in the trash and i didnt get that space back. how do i get rid of that 3GB folder i dont want / where did it go?
[06:06] <kepler> xrs, how did you delete it as root?
[06:06] <rubiconjosh> xrs: what folder did you delete and how did you delete it?
[06:06] <b1lly> ActionParsnip: ?
[06:06] <vhadil> hy
[06:06] <rubiconjosh> b1lly,  I am pretty sure he meant type that into a terminal to force that application to use your nvidia graphics card
[06:07] <b1lly> oh
[06:07] <b1lly> so I have to type that into terminal every time I want to launch an application
[06:07] <b1lly> ?
[06:07] <vhadil> on ubuntu 12.04 i'l instal squid, but squid3 installed no squid2, why
[06:07] <xrs> sudo sudo thunar, navigated to /media/$myuser/$USBdisk/media/$user/USBdisk/ right clicked on the folder i wanted gone and selected delete. (its from a diff comp that ran out of space and wouldnt boot so i slapped it into this computer to delete some files)
[06:07] <rubiconjosh> b1lly,  No
[06:08] <xrs> vhadil,  install manually specifying the version you want with apt-get (ensure backports are enabled in software sources)
[06:08] <vhadil> xrs, how to , im beginner
[06:08] <ActionParsnip> b1lly: yes, or ALT+F2

[06:11] <jcxl> kewel i've had what i thought was organ pain for the last 4 months to the point where i could barely shower or shave, had soo many tests done even a colonoscopy and endoscopy because they thought it was gi problems based on where the pain was,  i had my kidneys ultrasounded etc. and 3 ctscans.. all was fine...  then last night i got them ultrasounded again and they found a 4mm kidney stone in

[06:11] <jcxl> sooo relieved.. i thought i was going to be stuck in mystery pain for life
[06:12] <jcxl> thing is i've had it for so long, i don't think its going to pass on its own
[06:12] <IdleOne> xrs: no idea
[06:12] <kewel> jcxl: ya they're not cool .. and depending on where the get stuck, it can be like labor pains or gettting kick in the groin by a mule

[06:12] <jcxl> sorry

[06:31] <carl1> xubuntu recognizes the unused space on hard drive as dec and pen drive dec
[06:32] <xrs> this is ubuntu studio trying to delete files off a xubuntu hard drive
[06:32] <carl1> now my pen drive is format in dos/need a way to format and get it to recognize as dec or vice versa
[06:34] <carl1> take it this isn't really a help group.
[06:34] <xrs> i dont know what your asking for
[06:34] <xrs> over my head
[06:35] <carl1> i used to use eugene geeks but haven't seen a geek on there in a long time.
[06:35] <xrs> what is dec
[06:35] <majnoon> carl1, fdisk or gparted (or equivalents) SHOULD work
[06:35] <xrs> digital computer corp?
[06:35] <carl1> what the pen drive as recognized by xubuntu
[06:35] <xrs> digital equipment corp*
[06:35] <rubiconjosh> xrs, You could try du, dont run it with no arguments though... just learned what that does
[06:35] <carl1> dec the opposite
[06:36] <xrs> what is dec?
[06:36] <ActionParsnip> xrs: i was thinking the same
[06:36] <carl1> it is a label placed upon a drive
[06:36] <xrs> gparted, dont use labels
[06:36] <carl1> like c drive
[06:37] <carl1> yes it kind of does
[06:37] <carl1> unetbooten certainly does
[06:37] <carl1> and so does xubuntu or any other linux
[06:37] <xrs> gparted will format it. dont use labels, i have trouble when i try changing the volume name
[06:37] <carl1> no it won't
[06:37] <ActionParsnip> carl1: so what is the issue, you cannot mount the partition?
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[06:37] <carl1> it formatted by default as dos
[06:38] <xrs> yes lets get down to what are you relly here for? whats the error / root cause
[06:38] <carl1> couldn't make it format anoither way
[06:38] <ActionParsnip> carl1: when you last unplugged it, did you safely remove it in software before physically removing it
[06:38] <carl1> unetbooten would identify my hard drive as the only acceptable drive to load an iso onto.
[06:39] <carl1> its ok I am tired after a long day of virus battle and trying to work xubuntu.
[06:39] <antonio__> I'm trying to upgrade to 10.10 and I get a "fetching the upgrade failed. there might be a network problem"...yet I have an internet connection..what gives?
[06:39] <carl1> forget it I will get sleep and try again
[06:40] <carl1> probably have to go find a windows computer so it will do what I tell it to.
[06:40] <ActionParsnip> antonio__: i'd use the alternate maverick ISO and upgrade that way. Why not upgrade to Precise directly. LTS to LTS upgrades are very supported
[06:40] <antonio__> how can I upgrade to it directly?
[06:41] <ActionParsnip> !upgrade | antonio__

[06:41] <antonio__> Can I upgrade all the way to the current version?
[06:41] <carl1> If I could just load precise puppy on my flash I'd be ok but now I am stuck with a dos pen drive that linux won't recognize.
[06:41] <rubiconjosh> See you guys later
[06:41] <rdsm> rubiconjosh, cya.
[06:43] <ActionParsnip> antonio__: you'd need to upgrade to Precise first, then to Quantal
[06:43] <ActionParsnip> antonio__: or you could do a clean install
[06:43] <antonio__> which version is precise?

[06:47] <antonio__> aloha
[06:48] <tripelb> antonio__: basically you cant. you will need to back up and reinstall. but.make sure you get another opinion. there could.be something.i dont k ow.about
[06:52] <antonio__> how can I tell if my machine is 386 or 64?
[06:53] <ketan985> just type uname -a in terminal
[06:53] <antonio__> 686 is 64 bit, right?
[06:53] <tripelb> my friends. i have now deleted my extra partitions and will create new ones. it took 2 patient days to get an answer here but it was nowhere on tje foir how to repartion webpages, askubumtu (sic) and ubuntuforums and linuxbsdos and howtoplaza. Whew. -- now I have 22963 of space and 1G of RAM
[06:53] <SwedeMike> antonio__: no.
[06:54] <ActionParsnip> antonio__: thats the arch of the kernel, won't necessarily match the cpu :)
[06:54] <antonio__> how can I tell what my cpu is?
[06:54] <SwedeMike> antonio__: x86_64 means it's a 64bit kernel
[06:54] <SwedeMike> antonio__: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[06:54] <aeon-ltd> is there any problem in having / as ext2 and /home as ext4?
[06:54] <ActionParsnip> antonio__: cat /proc/cpuinof | grep -i model    then use the web to find out
[06:54] <ActionParsnip> aeon-ltd: none at all :)
[06:54] <tripelb> so i shold make 2 G of swap amd the rest /  ... AmIRite?
[06:55] <ActionParsnip> aeon-ltd: ext2 has no journal, so sudden power offs will be a bit scary
[06:55] <aeon-ltd> ActionParsnip: thanks, what about performance or errors? is journaling worth reinstalling / for?
[06:55] <ActionParsnip> tripelb: yes, you have less than 2Gb RAM so double RAM as swap is good
[06:55] <tripelb> ActionParsnip: can home be ntfa? i have been.wondering.that.
[06:56] <ActionParsnip> aeon-ltd: you can add a journal to ext2 to make it into ext3
[06:56] <tripelb> ok. wow am happy ActionParsnip
[06:56] <antonio__> swedemike: this is the pastebin I got from that process
[06:56] <ActionParsnip> tripelb: no, but you can have a small (2Gb) /home partition then store casual data like images and music etc on the NTFS
[06:57] <ActionParsnip> tripelb: you can then symlink to the ntfs for easy access
[06:57] <antonio__> I think its 64 bit, not sure though
[06:57] <ActionParsnip>  antonio__: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i model
[06:57] <antonio__> does Instruction Set - 64bit mean my processor is 64 bit
[06:57] <antonio__> tried that actionparsnip:
=== BEC is now known as alpha_
[06:58] <antonio__> cat: /proc/cpuinof: No such file or directory
[06:58] <ActionParsnip> antonio__: yes that's why I tweaked it

[06:59] <antonio__> when it says instruction set - 64 bit..does that mean its 64 bit?

[07:10] <BeautFreedom> foo357, with chmod -r a+rwx <device>
[07:10] <tripelb> crazybrain: that is on the live cd. y??ou have to use apt-get to pit it on your installed.system.
[07:10] <ActionParsnip> foo357: manually mount the device with better options is another way
[07:11] <crazybrain> tripelb: i typed apt-get install gparted

[07:14] <foo357> BeautFreedom: um, isn't it impossible to change permissions like that? Anyway I tried chmod'ing the particular files but it had no effect.
[07:14] <foo357> ActionParsnip: having to manually mount and deal with this would be undesirable
[07:15] <ActionParsnip> foo357: when you last unplugged the device, did you safly eject it before you removed it physically?
[07:15] <ActionParsnip> foo357: or did you just yank it out?
[07:16] <foo357> ActionParsnip: well yes, since the last boot
[07:17] <ActionParsnip> foo357: what file system is it using?
[07:17] <foo357> ActionParsnip: ntfs
[07:18] <ActionParsnip> foo357: have you chkdsk'd it in Windows?
[07:18] <foo357> ActionParsnip: no... but as far as I knoe there haven't been any indications of anything being wrong... what do you suspect?
[07:19] <ampalaya> hello. can anyone tell me the command to know the ip addresses/hosts/clients in a network?
[07:19] <ubuntun00b> Anyone here well versed with issues concerning wubi installations?
[07:19] <ActionParsnip> ampalaya: use nmap
[07:20] <dr_willis> ubuntun00b:  i would say - its best to avoid wubi whenever possible
[07:20] <ubuntun00b> dr_willis: I'm seeing this.
[07:20] <ampalaya> thanks but if i want to know all the clients connected in a network?
[07:20] <dr_willis> ampalaya:  clients for what service?
[07:20] <tripelb> ActionParsnip: i chose ext4 and swap tuened out as 1998M. -- now previously i booted into grub recovery ... so should i niw do "install the boot loader" ?  and what Device? ... or.skip.this part?  thanks.>
[07:21] <dr_willis> ampalaya:  you can scan the network to see all pcs on the network via nmap  - it should show most all of them
[07:21] <ampalaya> everything. all the services a client is running
[07:21] <dr_willis> ampalaya:  what if a pc on the network is not using the services :)   you want to know abbout it also?
[07:22] <tripelb> ubuntun00b:  avoid wubi.
[07:22] <ampalaya> yes their open ports as well
[07:22] <dr_willis> ampalaya:  sounds like a job for nmap of similer network scanners
[07:22] <ubuntun00b> I re-sized my Wubi install using the official manual from the website. After successfully completing the re-sizing, and successfully booting into Ubuntu via Wubi, I thought everything was great, except that it could not detect that I had enlarged the available disk space by 20GB.
[07:22] <dr_willis> or similer..
[07:23] <ampalaya> yes like a network scanner
[07:23] <dr_willis> ampalaya:  it is a network scanner. ;) not like one.
[07:23] <Pierreb> how can i add 24th of last month to a file with date if i run the script on the 1th of the new month so i can't use -X days as it will be different each month
[07:23] <dr_willis> !info nmap
[07:23] <ubottu> nmap (source: nmap): The Network Mapper. In component main, is extra. Version 6.00-0.1 (quantal), package size 4223 kB, installed size 14862 kB
[07:23] <ampalaya> lol yeah network scanner can nmap do that?
[07:24] <ubuntun00b> When I went to port it to a pre-formatted 100GB ext4 partition, I can no longer boot to Ubuntu. It states it cannot detect my display, and cannot detect my input. I have tried everything I can think of, but my irc handle says it all, I'm afraid
[07:24] <dr_willis> nmap IS a network scanner
[07:24] <tripelb> ubuntun00b:  wubi has imafinary disl.space. if windows falters oe cannot.be booted, aay different hardware then all your quni data is gone .. like mu.ponyo.disk image :(
[07:24] <dr_willis> ubuntun00b:  its possible to mount the wubi hd image from a live ccd and get files from it,
[07:25] <tripelb> dr_willis: e
[07:25] <ampalaya> yes it is, how can i display clients connected and the open ports in a wireless network
[07:26] <tripelb> dr_willis: really? oh hug!!! thats a project.for later.
[07:26] <iceroot> ampalaya: nmap host
[07:26] <ubuntun00b> tripelb: I had no such issue there. All the hardware is working great, no Windows failures, etc. That was the first thing I thought of, and spent a couple hours running various video diagnostics and hard drive diagnostics, including the standard windows chkdsk, and linux fsck
[07:26] <dr_willis> ampalaya:  its worth th etime to read the nmap docs
[07:26] <ubuntun00b> dr_willis: How is this possible, and where can I find documentation on how to make it happen?
[07:27] <ubuntun00b> I'd rather not clog up the channel with you walking me through it, you know?
[07:27] <dr_willis> ubuntun00b:  the wubi hd is a  file on the windows drivce. you can mount it via mounts loopback file feature
[07:27] <iceroot> ampalaya: nmap 192.168.0.0/24   change the network to the network you are using
[07:27] <ampalaya> will do. thanks
[07:27] <dr_willis> i dont use wubi. so cant walk ya through it. I dont know th efile names.. ;)
[07:27] <ubuntun00b> lol I do.
[07:28] <tripelb> ActionParsnip: i chose ext4 and so the swap turned out to be 1998M. --  previously i booted into grub recovery ... so should i now do "install the boot loader" ?  and what Device? ... or.skip.this part?  thanks.
[07:28] <ubuntun00b> Think I could do it using a GParted live disk?
[07:28] <ampalaya> thanks iceroot thats it i could nmap the whole subnet
[07:28] <__Hackuin__> ampalaya: Nmap is a over kill for your task, just try ping your /24 address and try a "arp -a", Don't just blindly scan a network.
[07:28] <dr_willis> the same can be done for a casper-rw file also. I recall others doing it for the wubi files. but ive never done so
[07:28] <dr_willis> gparted is not for disk image files last i tried it... but
[07:29] <dr_willis> im not sure it cant do it. ;) but gparted wont let you copy files from the image
[07:29] <iceroot> __Hackuin__: he wants all services
[07:29] <iceroot> __Hackuin__: on all clients of the network
[07:30] <dr_willis> if a client is running a servicce.. isent it a server? ;)
[07:30] <ubuntun00b> damn. I have an empty 100GB ext4 partition, and if I can rescue the 25GB of crap I have in my home folder, I'll be happy as hell.
[07:30] <tripelb> ubuntun00b:  can i pm you? if it works i want to give you my i fo so i can pick your brain later. i want my Ponyo disk image back.
[07:30] <iceroot> dr_willis: good point ;)

[07:31] <__Hackuin__> @ iceroot, didn't read next convo.. just read.. (12:49:00  IST) ampalaya: hello. can anyone tell me the command to know the ip addresses/hosts/clients in a network?

[08:43] <histo> ripthejacker: you'd have to man gnome-terminal most likely to find out how to open a new tab.  I'm sure you'd somehow have to specify which window you want a new tab in.
[08:44] <ripthejacker> histo, the window from which i run the script
[08:44] <histo> ripthejacker: also in a bash script program1 &   program 2 &   will run both at the same time.
[08:44] <apos> but i come fro the windows world where 1 txt based adv is made of thousands of scripts
[08:45] <dr_willis> i dont think it works that wat
[08:45] <dr_willis> way
[08:46] <histo> dr_willis: who?
[08:46] <commode-man> dr.willis: hi
[08:48] <dr_willis> reading tge man pages for gnome-terminal  i dont recall it wotking the way hes wanting.  i do see a neat profile feature. that wiuld eliminate the needs for the scripts
[08:49] <ripthejacker> dr_willis, eliminate the needs for the scripts???
[08:49] <ripthejacker> o.O
[08:49] <dr_willis> you can set a profile to run a command.
[08:49] <histo> ripthejacker: using just 1 & symbol like I suggested would start program1 and background it start program2 in the fg.  You could program1 &   program2 && fg    that way when you exit program2 you get the output for program1
[08:50] <ripthejacker> histo, i want fg for both, thats why i asked if i could start a new tab
[08:50] <histo> ripthejacker: why not just start a new terminal?
[08:50] <histo> ripthejacker: if you are tabbing them isn't that the same thing as jobs?  You could also use nohup so it doesn't exit when the shell dies
[08:51] <histo> ripthejacker: since you cant view both tabs at once.
[08:51] <ripthejacker> ripthejacker, but then why does gnome-terminal allow tabs if you cant view more than one at a time ?

[09:39] <ubottu> To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin.

Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.

[10:04] <holybladder> Hi guys. This one might need to go to a more specific Compiz/Unity/whatever channel, but I've been looking for an answer for ages and haven't found a satisfactory one...I would like a way to run an arbitrary application (mostly social networking) as a sidebar in Ubuntu. I can position and pin it with Devilspie or to an extent with Compizconfig, but I can't get other windows to "maximise around" it. IE I want to
[10:04] <holybladder>  reserve a section of screen space for that app and know that other apps won't invade it. Any suggestions?
[10:05] <Kalidarn> holybladder: you might be better off posting that on the forums

[10:24] <klawd> so what's the best and safest way to switch to testing then?

[10:25] <invariant> noxygen, this channel is about support; to me it seems more about trolling if people ask really dumb questions in response to questions.
[10:25] <inverse> i actually do have a spare hard drive, but i would like to install it on the same hard drive just so i don't have to waste time switching.
[10:25] <inverse> wouldn't that be easier?
[10:25] <MonkeyDust> noxygen  invariant is the only intelligent person in the channel, we ought to be aware of that
[10:25] <bianca> anyone?
[10:25] <dr_willis> inverse:  depends on the details.. my pc has  4 hard drives. ;)
[10:25] <auronandace> inverse: dual boot doesn't restrict you to one harddrive
[10:25] <IdleOne> invariant: consider that removal your only warning to change your attitude.
[10:25] <noxygen> inverse: Burn the cd, boot on and install on another partition or even better on a second hd
[10:26] <inverse> i see.
[10:26] <dr_willis> inverse:  you asked what was 'best' - its very handy to have the linux install totally on itss own hard drive on your  desktop machine.
[10:26] <inverse> i noticed on the website that you can download the Windows installer for Ubuntu
[10:26] <inverse> any benefit to that?
[10:26] <auronandace> inverse: avoid wubi if you can
[10:26] <dr_willis> inverse:  thats 'wubi' ....  dont use wubi.
[10:26] <dr_willis> thats a far far way from 'best'
[10:26] <dr_willis> ;)
[10:27] <IdleOne> invariant: in response to your question I suppose you could write a script that looks for newer installed version of the kernel headers and removes the old ones. I wouldn't know how to do that though.
[10:27] <inverse> lol
[10:27] <invariant> IdleOne, yes, I thought of that myself already.
[10:27] <inverse> okie well i want to install it on my hard drive, is there another way to do that without using Wubi?
[10:27] <invariant> IdleOne, and I can write that script.
[10:27] <IdleOne> invariant: well then, get to it :)
[10:27] <invariant> IdleOne, however, I thought Ubuntu was for human beings, meaning that such things should already work.
[10:27] <dr_willis> inverse:  the  normal install CCAN  dual boot from a single hard drive. you just need to resize your windows partions during install.
[10:28] <dr_willis> inverse:   be  sure to make backups of your system first..
[10:28] <invariant> IdleOne, these are practical features that an OS should have (clearning up the mess it creates)
[10:28] <dr_willis> inverse:  a power failure during resizeing = bad...
[10:28] <ikonia> invariant: stop
[10:28] <ikonia> invariant: leaving legacy kernels in place is not a mess
[10:28] <inverse> just out of curiosity, what's wrong with Wubi?
[10:28] <inverse> just for my own general knowledge.
[10:28] <IdleOne> invariant: feel free to create the script and package it, it may some day get added as a default.
[10:28] <invariant> ikonia, leaving a few around is not a problem.
[10:28] <ikonia> invariant: apt-get has clean up fuctions to remove obsolote packages, which you can run if you need to
[10:28] <dr_willis> inverse:  its fragile.  pron to crashing/brekaage. and hard to fix
[10:28] <invariant> ikonia, leaving 15 around is a problem.
[10:28] <ikonia> invariant: then remove them,
[10:29] <inverse> hmm.
[10:29] <ikonia> invariant: see if the apt-get clean up functions mark them as obsolte
[10:29] <dr_willis> They finally  got rid of that 'computer janitor' tool. ;) it caused more problems then it fixed
[10:29] <ikonia> (which will auto remove them)
[10:31] <bianca> i need help running a .sh file in playonlinux
[10:31] <lauksas> hi all, looking for an advice about ubuntu... I thinking to migrate to kubuntu, since unity is full of bugs, someone can tell me the pros and cons?
[10:31] <inverse> doesn't Wubi create the partition itself once it starts to install Ubuntu?
[10:31] <dr_willis> lauksas:  try it out.. see if you like it.
[10:31] <inverse> i have a lot of questions concerning Ubuntu, i'm glad someone is here.
[10:31] <dr_willis> Ill stick with Unity.
[10:32] <dr_willis> lauksas:  its trivial to have both desktops installed on the same system. you can switch  easially
[10:33] <Kartagis> bianca: make it executable with chmod +x file.sh, then use it like ./file.sh
[10:33] <bianca> Kartagis i have no idea what that means
[10:33] <lauksas> you mean install de KDE in my ubuntu? .. I know that it is possible, but the unity... is giving me headache
[10:34] <Kartagis> bianca: oh, and this is #ubuntu, join playonlinux channel
[10:34] <lauksas> since I install KDE, unity will still going up?
[10:34] <penguinman> lauksas: not at the same time, no
[10:34] <bianca> how do i find that channel
[10:34] <invariant> lauksas, the only limitation to the amount of desktop environments you can install is your diskspace.
[10:34] <penguinman> lauksas: you have the option to chose which de you use at login

[10:37] <blackbeard> can anybody help me with python macros discoverability?
[10:37] <blackbeard> I was using LO 3.6.2 but then tried 4 alpha 1 - and could not see my scripts,
[10:37] <blackbeard> which I copied to ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/Scripts/python
[10:37] <blackbeard> so I purged LO 4, removed ppa repositories and installed 3.6.2 from standard Ubuntu repos, alongside  with libreoffice-script-provider-python 1:3.6.2~rc2-0ubuntu4

[10:38] <antonio_> Aloha folks...
[10:38] <antonio_> So I finally installed the latest version :D
[10:38] <antonio_> Going to take a bit to get used to this..went from 10.04 to 12.10

[10:45] <foo357> dr_willis: I got the 64 bit version of the sources.list file, appending the whole 32 bit version seems like it could be a bit overkill
[10:46] <IdleOne> bianca: We don't need an update every 5 minutes on what the other channel is or isn't doing. Your issue appears to be a playonlimux problem and playonlinux is not supported in this channel.
[10:46] <antonio_> argh
[10:47] <antonio_> for some reason I can't get my wireless connections to work in 12.10
[10:47] <dr_willis> foo357: you have a 64 bit ppa you are using?

[10:49] <amcsi_work> I'm using ubuntu 12.10 and it doesn't let me change the date and time in its settings. Please help.
[10:50] <kaka> hi
[10:50] <emx> how do i get the ips of the used nameservers?
[10:50] <Sling> emx: cat /etc/resolv.conf
[10:51] <amcsi_work> it's like greyed out for me
[10:51] <emx> Sling, nameserver 127.0.1.1 <-- there must be more to it.
[10:51] <ikonia> /etc/resolv.conf should point at 127.0.1.1 on ubuntu
[10:51] <Sling> ah
[10:51] <ikonia> due to the way the dns resolution is setup on ubuntu - it uses local naming service to forward to external resources
[10:51] <Sling> of course, something out of the ordinary :)
[10:52] <Sling> the ubuntu way
[10:52] <mz`> dnsmasq used by networkmanager
[10:52] <Klojum> amcsi_work: how different is your time? Perhaps you selected the wrong timezone during installation?
[10:52] <mz`> completely out of control. etc/resolv.conf should contain the dns caches of the ISP, damnit.

[10:52] <kaka> hello
[10:53] <kaka> SB
[10:53] <ikonia> mz`: what ?
[10:53] <kaka> ‰Ω†ÊòØSB
[10:53] <antonio_> can someone help me to get my wireless connection working?
[10:53] <mz`> it is not right to use local dns cache, to use the real dns caches
[10:53] <thec4ke> ubuntu devs: lets make dns resolution dependent on a desktop app!
[10:53] <mz`> more processes for no gain
[10:54] <thec4ke> for people who wanted to use ubuntu as a server.. yyyyea sorry
[10:54] <mz`> 1 network manager + 1 dnsmasq ... instead of one dhclient and normal resolv.conf..
[10:54] <emx> so there is no way in ubuntu to read out the used nameservers?
[10:54] <mz`> there is
[10:54] <mz`> connection information in the network manager
[10:55] <mz`> if i remmeber well
[10:55] <thec4ke> pretty sure you can still use resolv.conf if you want
[10:55] <thec4ke> it will just break networkmanager
[10:55] <thec4ke> i run a router/firewall that completely ignores network manager
[10:56] <thec4ke> just add whatever dns you want to it or use dhclient

[11:01] <Klojum> Is networking altogether enabled?
[11:01] <antonio_> networking is enabled..the wired connection works fine

[11:03] <antonio_> k1l: how can I get that?
[11:03] <antonio_> actually..let me restart..brb
[11:03] <kepler> does wireless disable automatically when wired?

[11:54] <dr_willis> cristian_c:  No idea. It can be very hardware specific
[11:54] <cristian_c> dr_willis, ok
[11:54] <dr_willis> I would check the forums and bug reports for your specific hardware
[11:54] <cristian_c> ok
[11:55] <dr_willis> I never use suspend or hibernate. It just causes more troubles then its worth on linux and windows

[11:58] <vivek_> i have a problem at hand with ubuntu 12.04 pls can somebody help
[11:59] <_JF1976_> Q)> is there an easy way to include auto wireless WPA2/PSK connection for i386_netboot_12.04.iso ?
[11:59] <antonio_> k1l: and anyone else that can help.  When I try to install the WL driver I get this http://pastebin.com/t3LKK8sA
[12:01] <dr_willis> Module build for the currently running kernel was skipped since the
[12:01] <dr_willis> kernel source for this kernel does not seem to be installed.
[12:01] <dr_willis> So install the kernel source. :) most likely you just need the headers
[12:01] <dr_willis> !headers
[12:01] <ubottu> To install the Linux (kernel) headers, open a terminal and: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) To install headers for libraries, you need the accompanying -dev packages
[12:03] <foo357_> Hello, where can I configure the network setting for 12.04?
[12:03] <antonio_> dr_willis: was that for me?
[12:04] <dr_willis> antonio_:  that was your error message.. you need the proper kernel files to compile the driver
[12:04] <antonio_> dr_willis: so will sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) do that for me?
[12:04] <dr_willis> seems weird the package dident pull them in when you installed it
[12:05] <dr_willis> thats the command for the kernel headers.. yes..  You need those
[12:05] <antonio_> Thanks
[12:05] <dr_willis> you might need the full soruce.. but that would be weird.
[12:05] <MonkeyDust> antonio_  it looks something went wrong with wifi, during installation

[12:07] <cristian_c> :(
[12:08] <antonio_> still giving me that error

[12:22] <aged> what amount of memory would you reccomend for 11 10 in vbox please
[12:23] <cfhowlett> aged, half of your available ram
[12:23] <PatrickDickey> aged, what are you going to use it for, and how much memory do you have total?
[12:23] <FlowRiser> aged, the amount required by your os + the amount required by 11.10
[12:23] <nbubuntu> phoenix_firebrd : because I tested a thumb drive benchmark a must to format to test the write seq. I dont want to test again since I have file save in it and I need to format it empty. There's a log somewhere which save under disk utility
[12:24] <aged> 2gb vbox on xp pro dual boot with win7
[12:24] <PatrickDickey> aged I'd say no more than 1GB then. Otherwise vbox will give you warnings.
[12:25] <aged> thanks
[12:25] <PatrickDickey> aged no problem. If you're doing this to decide whether you like ubuntu or not, bear in mind that it acts differently in a virtual environment.
[12:26] <dr_willis> lubuntu works well in vbox
[12:26] <dr_willis> very handy tool to have
[12:26] <aged> yep then will have to learn how to triple boot with 7and xp pro and run raid with eigh hdd
[12:26] <cfhowlett> aged, slower for one thing.  also, unless you install guest additions, you won't see native resolution
[12:27] <cjae> jabulmer12: gnome-nettool
[12:27] <aged> tried 1210 did not like unity launcher bar on the side
[12:27] <PatrickDickey> aged Yeah, I can't help with the RAID part, but the triple boot won't be too bad. Just make sure you install Ubuntu last.

[12:30] <PatrickDickey> I like Unity. I just like trying different things. Plus, I was having "issues" with my computer, so I thought switching to a lighter desktop would help.... Nope.

[12:31] <bizhanMona> HI I am using Ubuntu 12.10. I am trying to utility from www.flashfrom.org to update the bios on my PC. I have used the same utility on Fedora 17, which can detect the SPI BIOS on the board, but it fails on Ubuntu? Thx
[12:31] <PatrickDickey> Yeah. it definitely is.
[12:31] <MonkeyDust> cinnamon on ubuntu (ppa) was a buggy failure here
[12:31] <andygraybeal> can someone briefly explain a "rolling release"  ... sounds like "moving target" to me :P
[12:32] <jrib> !sru | andygraybeal
[12:32] <ubottu> andygraybeal: Stable Release Update information is at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates
[12:32] <PatrickDickey> andygraybeal: It basically is a moving target. They set up a specific timeframe, and continually create new versions.  Think major versions not so much the .1 or .3 versions.
[12:32] <jrib> andygraybeal: that's ubuntu's update policy.  On a stable release, they just keep updating things to new versions as they are released
=== ulti-cleaner is now known as commode-man
[12:32] <jrib> andygraybeal: s/stable/rolling release/ sorry :)
[12:32] <cfhowlett> andygraybeal, consider that LTS releases are every 2 years, supported for 5 years.  Interim releases are every 6 months, supported for 2 years.  NOW: eliminate the interim release.  You'd have LTS's with point releases i.e. 12.4, 12.4.1, etc.
[12:32] <MonkeyDust> andygraybeal  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release
[12:32] <BluesKaj> andygraybeal, a rolling release doesn't have any dated releases, the OS is constantly upgraded
[12:33] <andygraybeal> thank you guys
[12:33] <PatrickDickey> bizhanMona: was it flashfrom.net or flashfrom.org? I ask, because I can't get to flashfrom.org.
[12:35] <PatrickDickey> bizhanMona: try joining #flashrom and ask there. That's their channel for IRC. I'd imagine they'll be able to guide you better than we can.
[12:35] <bizhanMona> PatrickDicky: flashfrom.org and thank you so much for your help.
[12:36] <auronandace> cfhowlett: interim releases are 18 months support, not 2 years
[12:36] <blackangel> guys had anyone have any issues with ati cards on 12.10 ?
[12:37] <auronandace> blackangel: many people have
[12:37] <adamk> blackangel: Someone, somewhere, probably has an issue with ati cards on 12.10.
[12:37] <cfhowlett> auronandace, ah ya?  I thought that got increased as well.  thanks for correcting my bad intel.
[12:37] <adamk> blackangel: What's the real question.
[12:37] <PatrickDickey> blackangel: yes. Which card do you have?
[12:37] <blackangel> i have the 5XXXX its supported but when i try to install the latest driver it show me this http://paste.ubuntu.com/1559445/
[12:38] <adamk> The log specifically mentions the need to have the kernel headers installed... Do you have them installed?
[12:39] <blackangel> i honestly dont know how to verify that :(
[12:39] <blackangel> i am learning
[12:39] <PatrickDickey> blackangel: you need to run sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[12:40]  * PatrickDickey easier to give the command, since kernel-headers doesn't exist.
[12:40] <blackangel> Patric that code gives unable to locate package
[12:41] <PatrickDickey> blackangel:  one second then.
[12:41] <dr_willis> !headers
[12:41] <ubottu> To install the Linux (kernel) headers, open a terminal and: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) To install headers for libraries, you need the accompanying -dev packages
[12:42] <dr_willis> done a sudo apt-get update recently?
[12:42] <blackangel> yes
[12:42] <blackangel> just did it
[12:42] <blackangel> carzy i try again now it worked
[12:42] <cfhowlett> serious question ... I just learned that macs keeps a log of EVERY file you download.  Does linux/ubuntu also?
[12:42] <Ben64> dr_willis: that doesn't seem like the best way to install headers
=== Jikan is now known as Jikai
[12:43] <Ben64> I'd do... sudo apt-get install linux-headers`uname -r | sed s/^.*[0-9]\-/-/g`
[12:43] <dr_willis> it worked for someone just 10 min ago
[12:43]  * PatrickDickey hopes ubuntu doesn't keep track of every file I downloaded... it might get jealous of all the Fedora iso's that I got. :P
[12:44] <Ben64> pretty sure ubottu's method only works for the current kernel, and then doesn't get new headers when the kernel changes
[12:44] <blackangel> trying to install the driver lest see
[12:44] <dr_willis> they needed the headers and sorce
[12:44] <PatrickDickey> Ben64: what exactly does your version of the command do? And for what blackangel needed, he only needs the current version.
[12:44]  * PatrickDickey or she*
[12:45] <commode-man> ikonia: hi
[12:45] <Ben64> PatrickDickey: it'd get linux-headers-generic as opposed to linux-headers-3.2.0-36-generic
[12:46] <Ben64> because what happens when 3.2.0-37 comes out
[12:46] <ikonia> commode-man: why do you keep hilighting me ?
[12:46] <commode-man> oops soree
[12:46] <ikonia> commode-man: you've done this multiple times, why do you keep doing it ?

[12:49] <ikonia> commode-man: open the url in a web browser

[12:50] <commode-man> got it
[12:50] <commode-man> thanks folks.
[12:54] <andygraybeal> normally if i were goign to move from 10.04 to 12.04, i would wipe clean and reinstall, just to get the freshness feeling.  if i'm on rolling updates, does this mean i don't have to do this?
[12:54] <ikonia> andygraybeal: don't have to
[12:54] <ikonia> andygraybeal: recommended, debatable
[12:54] <ikonia> andygraybeal: keep in mind the period of time between releases

[13:13] <angela_1> ikonia: thank you, but how can we know who runs cache server?
[13:14] <angela_1> kro[au]: another mirror in sense?
[13:14] <ikonia> angela_1: you're connecting to a mirror, based on IP - who set that up
[13:15] <dr_willis> apt-cache is a feature where you normally set up a single pc on the local lan to cache and hold/download all packages for the rest of the lan. to save download bandwitch.
[13:16] <ikonia> someone must have setup that cache
[13:17] <angela_1> <ikonia> ya, but i do not have much idea about who has set it.
[13:18] <dr_willis> angela_1:  so whos the admin/owner of this machine?
[13:18] <ikonia> angela_1: then either a.) find out and talk to them b.) change your mirror to a public one
[13:18] <yak_king> howdy cees!
[13:18] <aged> can i use a mouse with a wheel
[13:19] <ikonia> aged: yes
[13:19] <andygraybeal> thanks for the responses guys
[13:19] <yak_king> heheh I reading a few minutes behind.... sorry
[13:19] <cfhowlett> andygraybeal, have fun, be safe
[13:20] <angela_1> ikonia: okay. well I know the admin password so I have all the privileges.
[13:20] <dr_willis> aged:  scroll weels work fine here
[13:20] <dr_willis> bbl
[13:21] <kro[au]> resolved.
[13:21] <angela_1> ikonia: can you tell me how to change mirror to a public one?
[13:23] <foo357_> Hello, I've got a computer running 12.04 LTS x86_64 where I need to install some 32 bit packages, how can I do this?
[13:24] <andygraybeal> cfhowlett,  :))
[13:24] <jabulmer12> Hey
[13:24] <jabulmer12> the 32 bit packages can be installed and run as usual
[13:24] <jabulmer12> no specific changes required
[13:27] <subdesign> any replacement for gnome system tools in 12.10?
[13:27] <subdesign> repo has i386 only, cant install
[13:28] <fidel> heavily offtopic - but any channel you can recommend for hp-printer questions? i enabled ipsec on the printer (hell yeah thats possible) and now i cant reach the webinterface anymore hrhr
[13:28] <ikonia> fidel: if it's offtopic, don't ask it
[13:28] <ikonia> more so if you know it's offtopic
[13:28] <Pici> fidel:(fyi) #freenode can always suggest the proper channel for questions.
[13:28] <fidel> Pici: thx
[13:29] <jabulmer12> subdesign: Do you have the source code avalible
[13:29] <jabulmer12> ?
[13:31] <jabulmer12> subdesign: this should help http://www.shibuvarkala.com/2010/03/how-to-install-32bit-deb-applications.html
[13:31] <ikonia> subdesign: I strongly recommnd you do not follow the advice in that link
[13:32] <histo> jabulmer12: did you read that link?

[13:35] <moon`> Is there a way to get ubuntu to update without having to do restarts
[13:35] <moon`> I loathe system restarts for updates
[13:35] <moon`> I use to use ksplice to update the kernel but I see it doesn't work in 12.10
=== fisted_ is now known as fisted
[13:37] <histo> moon`: they show 12.10 supported on their site
[13:38] <tyler_d> I'm running 12.04 64 and would like to unencrypt my hard-disk, how would I accomplish this?
[13:38] <histo> moon`: also you should look and vote for http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/26083/

[13:41] <tyler_d> histo: so I may as well re-install at this point... dirty dirty
[13:41] <tyler_d> histo: ty for getting back though
=== c_smith_afk is now known as c_smith
[13:42] <histo> tyler_d: I wouldn't reinstall. I'd just copy your contents out.
[13:45] <tyler_d> histo: how would I determine if its just the home directory or the entire disk that is encrypted?
[13:45] <histo> tyler_d: I would assume running mount or looking at fstab should shed some light on what is using ecryptfs
[13:51] <JerusalemToker42> anybody here?
[13:51] <ikonia> many people
[13:51] <histo> no
[13:52] <histo> only like 1700+ ppl
[13:54] <PatrickDickey> JerusalemToker42: next question?
[13:56] <blez> I can't find the wubi for ubuntu 12.10
[13:56] <blez> can someone give me a working link?
=== JerusalemToker42 is now known as JerusalemT
[13:56] <blez> the ones on ubuntu.com give me 404
[13:56] <odaynot> hi, guy
[13:57] <PatrickDickey> !wubi | blez This might point you in the right direction.
[13:57] <ubottu> blez This might point you in the right direction.: Wubi is an Ubuntu installer for Windows users that allows you to install and uninstall Ubuntu like a Windows application, in a simple and safe way. http://wubi-installer.org/support.php and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide for troubleshooting. Please  file bugs at http://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug. For Ubuntu Oneiric/11.10 http://releases.ubuntu.com/oneiric/wubi.exe
[13:57] <JerusalemT> so as I was saying before my net connection went down, i only have shell access to my ubuntu machine
[13:57] <JerusalemT> and i was using the GUI to mount drives
[13:57] <Pici> blez: http://releases.ubuntu.com/quantal/wubi.exe
[13:58] <JerusalemT> from the menu, in the places section
[13:58] <JerusalemT> they didn't automount.
[13:58] <seednode> Are you unable to mount from shell?
[13:58] <histo> !mount | JerusalemT
[13:58] <ubottu> JerusalemT: mount is used to attach devices to directories. See also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount
[13:58] <JerusalemT> where is that info stored (the places shortcuts) and how can I mount those partitions from shell
[13:58] <JerusalemT> i don't know the parameters seednode
[13:58] <histo> JerusalemT: mount /dev/devicename /mount/point
[13:59] <BluesKaj> blez, if you intend to become a serious ubuntu user then wubi isn't like a full install of the OS ..it gives you an idea of what ubuntu is about that's all
[13:59] <PatrickDickey> Also blez, a lot of people come in here with issues because of wubi.
[13:59] <JerusalemT> anyone know where that is?
[13:59] <blez> I found it. Let's hope it doesn't screw up my bootloader
[14:00] <seednode> BluesKaj, I've never had issues with Wubi; installs with it have been just as stable as fresh installs.
[14:00] <linuxusr> Hi i add additional 2 ip`s on my debian based dedicated server by editing /etc/network/interfaces >>  http://pastebin.com/XBuc7UvN  >> please check for me the configration is right >> Thanks in Adnace for your kind time :)
[14:00] <PatrickDickey> JerusalemT: Do you know which drives are which?  If so, you can use fdisk -l to find out which drives are assigned to what /dev/ and then add them to your /etc/fstab. I would say check the link that ubottu put up earlier though.
[14:01] <BluesKaj> stability isn't what I meant seednode , but to each his own
[14:01] <PatrickDickey> !mount | JerusalemT check this link for more information.
[14:01] <ubottu> JerusalemT check this link for more information.: mount is used to attach devices to directories. See also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount
[14:01] <seednode> BluesKaj, I'm just curious what issues you've had with it? I've not had more issues with than any other install method.
[14:02] <JerusalemT> let me try to refine my question. in the ubuntu GUI, i had shortcuts in the "places". where is that info available from the shell?
[14:02] <seednode> "Info" meaning contents/labels of your drives?
[14:02] <seednode> I'm not sure what you mean.
[14:03] <JerusalemT> sorry i'm not being clear.
[14:03] <zetheroo> is Unity running on Gnome? ... Is any part of the Unity desktop still Gnome?
[14:03] <BluesKaj> it's not real install , seednode....it's a file that runs in windows
[14:04] <ThinkT510> zetheroo: unity runs on top of gnome3
[14:04] <Pici> zetheroo: yes. Unity is a shell for gnome3, but its not gnome shell.
[14:04] <JerusalemT> In the ubuntu GUI, at the top, there is a menu option Places
[14:04] <seednode> So, Windows still runs in the background when you boot to Ubuntu with it? Odd, I haven't seen 2GB+ idle RAM usage with it
[14:04] <JerusalemT> I managed to bookmark the mounts there and simply had to click on them to mount them
[14:04] <JerusalemT> but i cant access the gui
=== MartinS is now known as Guest34094
[14:04] <seednode> Well, as other users have said, you'll probably have to mount them manually
[14:05] <JerusalemT> i got that part.
[14:05] <seednode> So, say you have files on a fourth drive (after the default /, /home, and /boot)
[14:05] <JerusalemT> my question is in what file is the "places" info stored?
[14:05] <ThinkT510> JerusalemT: are you running 10.04?
[14:05] <Pici> JerusalemT: What are you looking for? The names of the locations you mounted?
[14:05] <seednode> You'd use 'mount /dev/sda4 /mount/point/here' (Assuming sda4 is the disk)
[14:06] <JerusalemT> so how do i figure out what /dev/??? is?
[14:06] <blez> I downloaded the 12.10 version
[14:06] <ThinkT510> JerusalemT: sudo fdisk -l
[14:06] <seednode> BluesKaj, that was a legitimate question; "it's a file that runs in windows" So you boot into Windows with Ubuntu running over it?
[14:06] <ThinkT510> JerusalemT: or launch gparted
[14:07] <JerusalemT> making progress
[14:08] <JerusalemT> found em
[14:08] <blez> I already downloaded it from http://nz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-releases/12.10/wubi.exe
[14:08] <BluesKaj> seednode, you can boot directly into the wubi/ubuntu file , but it's still running inside windows , not on top., if you want to run windows and ubuntu , dual booting is the best method
[14:08] <seednode> So, explain again
[14:08] <seednode> If it's running INSIDE Windows
[14:08] <seednode> Doesn't the mean Windows must also run?
[14:09] <seednode> Your terminology here is ambiguous
[14:09] <ikonia> seednode: it's running within the windows file system
[14:09] <ikonia> seednode: nothing else
[14:09] <ThinkT510> seednode: what he means is that the file is located on the windows partition
[14:09] <seednode> Ah, that makes more sense
[14:09] <Pici> seednode: it can make changing the boot paramaters tough, and upgrading can be painful as well.
[14:09] <seednode> Can you not, then, create an ext4 filesystem on a second hard drive?
[14:09] <ikonia> seednode: you certainly can
[14:09] <seednode> And mount that as /home?
[14:09] <ikonia> seednode: you can do whatever you want
[14:09] <seednode> Just making sure
[14:10] <seednode> He was kinda making it sound like you were limited to NTFS
[14:10] <ikonia> seednode: it doesn't run on NTFS
[14:10] <Pici> seednode: Its not actually NTFS, its a disk image in a file.
[14:10] <ikonia> it runs on a file system stored within a file on an NTFS partition
[14:10] <seednode> Ah, so it's kinda like a Virtual machine, then?
[14:10] <ikonia> no
[14:10] <seednode> Except without Windows in the background?
[14:10] <ikonia> no
[14:10] <seednode> If it's not a true boot
[14:10] <ikonia> it's nothing like a virtual machine
[14:10] <seednode> Nor emulation
[14:10] <FloodBot1> ikonia: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[14:10] <ikonia> it is true boot
[14:10] <seednode> And it requires Windows
[14:10] <seednode> Huh...
[14:11] <seednode> wonder why I wasn't quieted
[14:11] <seednode> Floodbot loves me
[14:11] <BluesKaj> !wubi | seednode

[14:11] <ThinkT510> a vm will always be safer than wubi
[14:11] <blez> why it's not a full install? what's the difference?
[14:11] <JerusalemT> SCHWEET! Thanks guys. I found my data. Can someone point me to a faq about automounting them when I boot?
[14:12] <seednode> JerusalemT, just look up fstab automounts
[14:12] <ThinkT510> !fstab | JerusalemT

[14:12] <JerusalemT> muchos gracious guys
[14:13] <blez> PatrickDickey the thing is, that I'm having a tablet/laptop with Intel Atom, it has Windows 8, but I want to dual boot ubuntu. I just got a new minisd card and I'm trying wubi
[14:13] <seednode> I'm curious; if wubi is that unsafe AND convoluted, why does Canonical distribute it?
[14:13] <seednode> Seems like a bad idea.
[14:13] <blez> the thing is that the tablet has UEFI, and it doesn't see my bootable usb drive
[14:14] <ikonia> seednode: it's not "unsafe"
[14:14] <cfhowlett> seednode, wubi is for testing.  used as it's intended, it's great
[14:14] <ikonia> seednode: it is restricted a little more than a normal install
[14:14] <k1l> seednode: its for testing purposes. to let the windows user see what its about
[14:14] <seednode> You said it's less safe than using it in a VM
[14:14] <ikonia> seednode: it's only unsafe if people use it incorrectly
[14:14] <ikonia> seednode: yes, less safe is not the same as "unsafe"
[14:14] <PatrickDickey> blez: That's because Microsoft conviced (ok, demanded) that tablet makers lock their UEFI boots down.
[14:14] <ikonia> personally - I don't find it safe, because so many users break their systems by not researching what they are doing
[14:14] <blez> what's why I'm trying minisd now, but one guy told me that ubuntu's installer don't see the GPT partitions
[14:14] <ikonia> but that is a user problem, not a product problem
[14:14] <blez> and scews them up
[14:15] <ikonia> blez: ubuntu is fine with gpt
[14:15] <blez> .......
[14:15] <blez> YES, that's what just happened.

[14:24] <njd001> thought i would try here first.
[14:24] <Pici> apsassin: Its somehere in the CCC, I always struggle to find it on my computer too.  I don't have graphical access to that machine right now though, so I can't really help.
[14:25] <njd001> my plan is to use native virtualization in ubuntu and clone my current SSD to a file
[14:26] <MEGASHAREUPLOAD> 50gb free for your files: megashareupload . com
[14:26] <apsassin> Pici, i have read that it should be in CCC>display manager>DTV>Scaling but i dont see DTV or scaling anywhere.
[14:26] <njd001> ThinkT510 one stupid user question when i plug in a usb disk (2 TB) is there a way to get ubuntu to discover  this or does it do this by itself.
[14:26] <histo> njd001: why not jsut image to a file and then mount that file as the drive in virtualization software
[14:26] <Pici> apsassin: Are you running it with gksudo?
[14:27] <histo> njd001: does it by itself
[14:27] <njd001> thats the plan histo :)
[14:27] <apsassin> thanks for acknowledging anyway. i will go back to google.
[14:27] <apsassin> yes i am
[14:27] <njd001> but i want ubuntu to use the 180 GB SSD for a boot device
[14:27] <phillip> ubuntu

[14:27] <njd001> histo oh nice DD
[14:27] <njd001> will DD do this if the disk is protected by bitlocker?
[14:27] <apsassin> though i am in GUI
[14:28] <apsassin> as administrator
[14:28] <njd001> will it just capture it as a gian binary file or should i decrypt it first?
[14:28] <histo> njd001: no you'd have to unencrypt it
[14:28] <njd001> Giant*
[14:28] <histo> njd001: or decrypt
[14:28] <njd001> histo sounds good :D
[14:28] <histo> njd001: otherwise you'd just image a bunch of encrypted data.
[14:29] <njd001> has been a M$FT winnie for the last 20 years and windows 8/2012 is disappointing so i am very excited to get started with ubuntu.
[14:29] <njd001> but alias i still need a windows image for other things. :(
[14:29] <histo> njd001: be very carefull with the dd command. You can wipe a drive with a typo

[14:37] <histo> dhanasekaran: I like ikonia's solution better
[14:38] <njd001> hey another dumb question with respect to the ubuntu install
[14:38] <njd001> when you have a platform with 2 video devices does it get messy with a vm?
[14:38] <ikonia> no
[14:38] <ikonia> the virtual machines use a virtual video device
[14:39] <njd001> oh pooh.
[14:39] <njd001> So I cannot allocate one video device to local and one to virtual?
[14:40] <ikonia> njd001: you can use PCI passthrough, but I suspect you'll strugle with that
[14:40] <njd001> ikonia i could also ping soren see how he does it i would imagine i am not the first person to want to do this or even try it
[14:40] <kesi> Hi guys, For some reason all of my active program tabs show up on every workspace although they aren't in that particular workspace. I can't find the setting to changethis.
[14:41] <ikonia> njd001: why do you need to ping someone else when I've ust told you how to do it
[14:41] <njd001> oh well you said i would struggle
[14:41] <ikonia> njd001: yes, I supect you would, but asking someone else won't change that, but you are of course welcome to do what you see best
[14:41]  * njd001 isnt fluent on desktop side im a server guy
[14:42] <ikonia> njd001: and yet you are struggling with "server" functions
[14:42] <njd001> no.
[14:42] <ikonia> oh, you seem to be
[14:42] <ikonia> my mistake
[14:42] <njd001> server side i just deal with deployments which is gui-less in my lab
[14:42] <ikonia> njd001: right, so you should be fine with this then
[14:42] <ikonia> as it's configuring a virtual machine
[14:43]  * njd001 is still learning...
[14:43] <ikonia> which is totally managment by the command line
[14:43] <vms> list
[14:43]  * njd001 has a feeling he will need to invest in some patience to make this work as well.
[14:44]  * ikonia has a feeling he should stop trying to justify not being able to do things and stop using /me commands
[14:44] <njd001> point noted.

[15:20] <Pici> dhanasekaran: As the manpage says, the first and second number would be for interval and count, repectively.

[15:21] <dhanasekaran> Pici: one minute interval  one count right?

[16:12] <ubottu> tobyjones8: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic

[16:24] <jrib> astropirate: "Home directory /home/mansoor not ours"
[16:24] <ikonia> astropirate: looks like you've tried to put a lot of compiz projects in
[16:24] <astropirate> what does that mean?
[16:24] <astropirate> i haven't touched or configured anything in months
[16:24] <hagzag> astropirate: not sure ...
[16:25] <jrib> astropirate: what's the output of ¬´ ls -ld /home/mansoor ¬ª?

[16:25] <jrib> "ohh" :)
[16:25] <scotty^> mode scotty^ -i
[16:25] <astropirate> I have Unity and Xmonad running together
[16:25] <astropirate> maybe that cased it?
[16:25] <scotty^> oops
[16:26] <astropirate> but it has been running like that for months and months
[16:26] <astropirate> just fine
[16:26] <jrib> astropirate: it's also trying to load things from /root which seems strange.
[16:26] <astropirate> I cant log into the other DMs either
[16:26] <Beast> say, lately I've been having artifacts, large areas of my screen not refreshing and displaying what ever was previouly rendered as if frozen despite changing the content in the area. Might this be a video card problem?
[16:27] <ikonia> looks like you've been messing around as root
[16:27] <ikonia> and permissions / locations have got messed up
[16:27] <ozpy> usr13: Sorry about the delay. There's no unity working. Just a purple background
[16:27] <compdoc> Beast, bad memory on the vid card can cause artifacts.
[16:27] <bipul> I am looking some ubuntu tuts for writing code in C for Packet capturing through libpcap
[16:27] <Beast> I've noticed it happens when leafpad runs and disappears as soon as I close it
[16:27] <astropirate> ikonia, banshee is sound right? can I disable it?
[16:28] <ikonia> astropirate: create a new user and see if you can login as that user
[16:28] <astropirate> I just need to get this work done
[16:28] <astropirate> ok
[16:28] <compdoc> Beast, does the card have a fan? is the fan running? is the heatsink under the fan clogged with dust?
[16:28] <Beast> compdoc: regardless of it happening only when leafpad runs?
[16:28] <ikonia> astropirate: don't worry about banshee

[16:28] <kimsia> http://askubuntu.com/q/245996/10591
[16:28] <astropirate> Pici, nope, dont use docky
[16:29] <Beast> compdoc: I haven't opened up the laptop but it is running on one fan, the other one failed on my a while ago.
[16:29] <kimsia> any advice?
[16:29] <astropirate> i have literally done no configuration at all with this computer

[16:29] <kimsia> what do you mean?
=== yann_ is now known as YannT
[16:29] <Mi`> lol
[16:29] <Pici> astropirate: you could try deleting/backing up ~/.local/share/gnome-do and then trying again.
[16:29] <kimsia> ikonia: meaning t o say what should I do?
[16:29] <ikonia> kimsia: look at the error " Download of "pecl/perl" succeeded, but it is not a valid package archive"
[16:30] <compdoc> Beast, Ive seen problems with the ribbon cable that connects the display in laptops
[16:30] <ikonia> kimsia: also why ar eyou telling us your PHP version, when you are trying to download perl.....not php
[16:30] <kimsia> ikonia: how do i determine what is a valid package archive?
[16:30] <ikonia> kimsia: it it is valid, it contains all the files etc
[16:30] <kimsia> I found the instructions on how to download and install the perl pecl extension so that I can call Perl scripts from PHP
[16:30] <ikonia> kimsia: basically using pecl is a bad idea in my view
[16:30] <Beast> compdoc: I might think of having it cleaned. Yes, a laptop, it's a macbook pro. I've angled it, made a cooling stand using an ikea towel hanger and taken out the battery so as to compensate for being one fan down.
[16:30] <ikonia> there are perl-php modules alreedy in the ubuntu repo

[16:31] <ikonia> kimsia: I don't need to see that
[16:31] <Beast> compdoc: interesting, as to the ribbon as I suspect there is a problem with that here as my screen stopped working a few months ago. I use an external monitor now, forced to.

[16:32] <compdoc> Beast, heh. Maybe time for a new laptop?
[16:32] <ESPARTANO> hello guys
[16:32] <kimsia> ikonia: sorry. I am forced to use that because a particular Perl module has the functions i needed that no PHP library provides
[16:33] <ikonia> kimsia:  I disagree, there is a php->perl module availablve inthe ubuntu repos
[16:33] <ikonia> kimsia: but that's up to you, but I strongly advise you not to use pecl - but it's up to you
[16:33] <Beast> compdoc: I also had my power cut off, and I'm not running a surge protector, although th contractor said there should be no problem as he didn't turn the power on, so no surge. Could this be related.
[16:33] <mansoor-s> woohoo!!
[16:33] <mansoor-s> it worked
[16:33] <Beast> ?
[16:33] <mansoor-s> who told me to delete the  gnome-do directory?
[16:34] <mansoor-s> thank you all for help!!
[16:34] <compdoc> Beast, surges are an problem. Just losing power tends not to be a problem, but occasionally it can corrupt files.
[16:34] <belgianguy> hello
[16:34] <Pici> mansoor-s: I did. you're welcome.
[16:34] <belgianguy> if one was interested in the Ubuntu project, where would one start?

[16:36] <Beast> compdoc: Yeah, I got a hand me down toshiba on sight. It runs a little too hot, and will have to do a bios update (for the fan/heat issues) without windows installed, a challenge in of itself. Heck, I might just install windows to do the bios update. We'll see assoon as I can get my hands on it permanently.

[16:39] <lenlen>  when I try to launch "gnome-terminal" the window is blank
[16:39] <ikonia> I'm sure there is on in there hang on, I've not got an ubuntu machine here to check
[16:39] <lenlen> could somebody help me, please?
[16:39] <kimsia> ikonia: i tried this search http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=php+perl&searchon=names&suite=quantal&section=all

[16:42] <kesi> Need help installing unity from the command line on 12.04
[16:42] <ikonia> kimsia: can't see anything specific, I'm still looking though
[16:43] <kimsia> ikonia: thank you i too am also searching
[16:43] <kesi> Am I visible?
[16:43] <ikonia> kimsia: you can also use the php "file" option to run external files, such as perl cgi scripts
[16:43] <Beast> compdoc: thanks for the advice and feedback
[16:43] <kimsia> ikonia: let me give that a shot
[16:44] <kimsia> ikonia: I see. I needed to execute the perl scripts programatically inside a PHP file
[16:45] <kimsia> ikonia: not really using the php command line though
[16:45] <ovidiu-florin> is it safe to install Java7 from the official rpm package using alien?
[16:45] <kesi> Can you install unity on top of gnome?
[16:45] <ikonia> kimsia: there is a php function (I'm sure the guys in ##php can give you the proper syntax) that is something like file ('/home/user/create-stats.pl')
[16:45] <ovidiu-florin> I don't have openjdk installed, and I'd preffer not to install it
[16:45] <ikonia> kimsia: it will allow you to call perl files like that,
[16:46] <xangua> kesi: unity is a shell for gnome
[16:46] <ikonia> kimsia: there is also a way you can hook it into the cgi directory
[16:46] <ikonia> kimsia: I don't know the syntax as I'm not really a php user, but the guys in ##php should be able to correct me
[16:46] <ThinkT510> !alien | ovidiu-florin
[16:46] <ubottu> ovidiu-florin: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu uses !APT, not RPM. RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous and unsupported)
[16:46] <kesi> xangua, I have 12.04 on the command line and I can install gnome and run it but I can't install unity
[16:46] <kimsia> ikonia: got it. i will go check
[16:47] <ovidiu-florin> aha
[16:47] <kesi> xangua, can I install Gnome and then upgrade to Unity somehow?
[16:47] <Pici> kesi: What happens when you try to install Unity?
[16:47] <ovidiu-florin> then what is the ubuntu way of installing Java7? (not open JDK)
[16:47] <kesi> Pici, errors about the display :0
[16:47] <k1l> kesi: you tried to install the "ubuntu-desktop" package?
[16:47] <ThinkT510> !java | ovidiu-florin
[16:47] <ubottu> ovidiu-florin: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[16:48] <Pici> kesi: When you *install* it? or when you use it?
[16:48] <kesi> kll, that's what I selected during install
[16:48] <mkultra> ubuntus way of installing java is apt-get, try synaptic searching for java
[16:48] <kesi> Pici, after install when I try to run it
[16:48] <sgtkilljoy> mkultra: well apt........

[16:51] <kesi> Pici, command line after install

[17:11] <pyro254750> isnt the usb/dvd tool just used to burn an iso of the windows 7 installation image?
[17:11] <vitor> same error
[17:11] <vitor> yes pyro
[17:11] <ovidiu-florin> google that error
[17:11] <pyro254750> ubuntu can burn images natively
[17:11] <Dizzle> wouldnt unetbootin do the same?
[17:11] <ovidiu-florin> Dizzle: yes it would
[17:12] <ovidiu-florin> actually unetbootin is jut for USB drives, not for burning CD/DVD's
[17:12] <sgtkilljoy> or usb-imagewriter
[17:13] <melvin_>  /show window 3
[17:13] <pyro254750> vitor: you can burn the image natively from within ubuntu. If im not mistaken you have to purchase the iso to use the usb/dvd download tool, and it downloads the iso and burns it for you. So what that means for you, is that since you have purchased a license, you can download the .iso from torrent or newsgroups and use your legal serial and have a 100% legit copy of windows
[17:14] <pyro254750> vitor: that would allow you to burn the image natively and not have to mess with wine

[17:46] <pyro254750> so you arent trying to burn a mint iso to a dvd, your trying to burn it to a flash drive? or you are trying to create a boot disk to install from the flash drive? please clarify
[17:47] <ihatewinbad> Boot Disk to Install from the flash drive.
[17:47] <pyro254750> you can select boot device when pc is booting up, usually something like f12 during post check, and select usb device
[17:48] <ihatewinbad> That's not the issue I am having. I am just not sure what application would work best to write the ISO image, so I can boot it.

[18:55] <rypervenche> makerbreakr: What is the exit code coming from that fist command? and did you add this to root's crontab?
[18:55] <makerbreakr> it is /etc/cron.d/
[18:55] <jhutchins> Could someone check one of the config files in boot and search for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e2fJfiddx4
[18:55] <jhutchins> Arg, bufferbusted again.
[18:56] <jhutchins> CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS=
[18:56] <makerbreakr> and, Im not sure what the exit code is from the first command, but it should be completing successfully
[18:56] <makerbreakr> (ie, the file does get moved)
[18:56] <jhutchins> I suspect it's CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS=4
[18:56] <rypervenche> makerbreakr: try doing it from root's cron (sudo crontab -e)

[18:56] <vlaca> jhutchins: says 32
[18:56] <jhutchins> (That video by the way is a very nice rendition of Stairway by Heart, with some interesting people in the audience.)
[18:56] <LIDH> so, it only detects 4
[18:57] <jhutchins> vlaca: Interesting, that's changed.
[18:57] <LIDH> i did setserial -g /dev/ttyS[0-9]
[18:57] <vlaca> (on 12.10)
[18:57] <rypervenche> makerbreakr: root mv /etc/X11/91-ServerFlags.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/91-ServerFlags.conf; echo $? > /root/exitcode
[18:57] <LIDH> and only ttyS[0-4] got detected
[18:57] <jhutchins> LIDH: Double check the config file on your system.
[18:57] <LIDH> ok, how?
[18:57] <LIDH> sudo nano /etc/config?
[18:57] <LIDH> where's the config file?
[18:58] <rypervenche> makerbreakr: The exit code may still not be 0, in which case the && will prevent lightdm from restarting.
[18:58] <jhutchins> grep CONFIG_SERIAL /boot/coinfig-`uname -r`
[18:58] <jhutchins> config
[18:58] <jhutchins> grep CONFIG_SERIAL /boot/config-`uname -r`
[18:58] <makerbreakr> rypervenche, if I put any other command there it works
[18:58] <makerbreakr> ie /sbin/reboot
[18:59] <makerbreakr> exitcode is 127
[18:59] <rypervenche> that's why
[18:59] <jhutchins> LIDH: Probably not a bad idea to just grep CONFIG_SERIAL /boot/config-`uname r`
[18:59] <shock_one> Hi. Is there any way to make Ubuntu wake up faster? It takes about 8 seconds compared to 2 in OS X on the same hardware.
[19:00] <MonkeyDust> shock_one  more swap, maybe
[19:01] <rypervenche> makerbreakr: It may be because it is overwriting an old file, in which case using mv -f may work.
[19:01] <LIDH> did that but it failed, maybe i'm doing it wrong
[19:01] <LIDH> did exactly as you typed here
[19:01] <roger_padactor> I installed a ubuntu image on ec2 the other day and when looking at the http conf folder it was missing the site-available and sites-enabled.  how do I have that setup?
[19:02] <makerbreakr> rypervenche, no go
[19:02] <shock_one> MonkeyDust, I don't have swap. As far as I know sleep (S3 mode) doesn't use HDD to store information from memory. How would swap help?
[19:02] <makerbreakr> i was able to have the exit code 127 and reboot the machien though, rather than restart lightdm
[19:02] <rypervenche> makerbreakr: I don't know what the 127 exit code is for though, so I can't say.
[19:02] <makerbreakr> i think its something to do with the way lightdm specifically works
[19:02] <RobinJ> in which channel do i need to be for http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=synlnIErJKU ?
[19:03] <rypervenche> makerbreakr: not possible. You probably didn't have a 127 exit code that time that you did.
[19:03] <Pici> RobinJ: Please don't post random links here. If you have a question, just ask it.
[19:03] <RobinJ> ..... Pici not random.
[19:03] <makerbreakr> rypervenche, i am going to remove the mv part of it
[19:03] <jhutchins> LIDH: Ok, instead of the part in the ` marks, just use tab.
[19:03] <LIDH> so, how do i do that grep config_serial thing?
[19:03] <makerbreakr> and just have it run /etc/init.d/lightdm restart
[19:03] <rypervenche> makerbreakr: You could use ; instead of &&
[19:03] <MonkeyDust> shock_one  would that be hibernate or suspend?
[19:03] <LIDH> ok
[19:04] <LIDH> brb, i have to go 2 floors down to get the POS
[19:04] <jhutchins> LIDH: I'm off digging through some old documentation on this.  Used to do POS myself.
[19:04] <shock_one> MonkeyDust, suspend.
[19:04] <LIDH> I really appreciate that, if we were neighbours i would pay you some cold beers ;)
[19:04] <MonkeyDust> shock_one  then use swap, it has to be larger than your ram
[19:04] <_methods> LIDH: you'll probably have to add som uarts to grub

[19:06] <bean> ?
[19:06] <MoL0ToV> 00:04.0 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation Device 0153 (rev 09) - what is this?
[19:06] <jaequery> yea I'm root
[19:06] <jhutchins> LIDH: If the kernel config is ok, you need to know what parameters the ports use - what IRQ and IO address.
[19:06] <makerbreakr> 07 01 * * 3  /usr/bin/service lightdm restart ; echo $? > /root/exitcode
[19:07] <bean> jaequery, not sure then.
[19:07] <makerbreakr> rypervenche, that yeilds no exit code in /root
[19:07] <shock_one> MonkeyDust, Can you explain why would it make waking up faster. I have some doubts about it ‚Äî in suspend mode memory content isn't written out but remains in RAM.
[19:07] <makerbreakr> which is weird

[19:15] <jhutchins> MonkeyDust: I prefer to use "suspend to disk" or "suspend to ram" - "sleep" and "hibernate" can mean either.

[20:10] <OerHeks> ErdMutter, maybe this askubuntu answer is any help >> http://askubuntu.com/questions/103886/dual-boot-ubuntu-using-3-times-more-battery-than-leopard/104089#104089
[20:11] <disharmonic> HW accelerated XBMC works fine as well.
[20:11] <crawln> for i in *.mkv; do avconv -i "$i.mkv" -c copy "$i.mp4"; done
[20:12] <ErdMutter> OerHeks: Thank you, I will read though it. :)
[20:12] <jrib> crawln: so you just want to rename them at this point or do you want to redo the converting and get the name right from the start?
[20:12] <ultreia> disharmonic- then the problem must be in the window manager rather than in X. I can understand unity being a failure, but not so for kde
[20:12] <crawln> get the name right from the start
[20:12] <KeyboardNotFound> Hi, i joined added monitor into the VGA port on my laptop, but I see the same monitor I see the laptop, how do I monitor to see one workspace and the other monitor (laptop) other workspace?
[20:12] <crawln> i know i can use the cp *.mkv.mp4 *.mp4
[20:12] <crawln> but that's just annoying lol
[20:12] <crawln> wanna do it right from the beginning
[20:13] <disharmonic> ultreia, it's what has me perplexed as well. On top of that E17 works fine
[20:13] <jrib> crawln: try this example in your shell: foo=file.mkv; echo ${foo}; echo ${foo%.mkv}
[20:13] <jrtappers> KeyboardNotFound, to stop them being in clone use the display settings
[20:14] <jrtappers> type in "Display" at the launcher, it should come up
[20:14] <ultreia> disharmonic- perhaps it is something in your xinitrc file?
[20:15] <disharmonic> i didn't touch that but i'll tke a look. is there a log of recently updated/installed packages?
[20:15] <crawln> i see how that is
[20:15] <jrib> crawln: ok, so now you know how to modify your command?
[20:15] <donnie> How do I tell update manager to stop displaying updates. When "Don't display updates" is checked
[20:17] <ultreia> disharmonic- /var/log/dpkg.log (I think)
[20:17] <disharmonic> ultreia, duh. thanks
[20:18] <crawln> for i in *.mkv; avconv -i "${file%.mkv}  -codec copy ${file%.mp4} ; done?
[20:18] <crawln> or would it just be
[20:18] <crawln> for i in *.mkv; avconv -i "$i" -codec copy ${file%.mp4} ; done?
[20:18] <jp^> Any one know how to add lines to a text file which is in a zip file ?
[20:19] <zykotick9> crawln: you are missing a do in there
[20:19] <crawln> for i in *.mkv; do avconv -i "$i" -codec copy ${file%.mp4} ; done?
[20:19] <crawln> i was more worried about the correct placing of the file%
[20:19] <ultreia> disharmonic- did these problems begin when you switched from one WM to the other?
[20:20] <disharmonic> ultreia, no. I see some mesa packages in my dpkg log, which is weird
[20:21] <jrib> crawln: not exactly.
=== thor__ is now known as juegas
[20:22] <jrib> crawln: put an "echo" before your "avconv" and run what you have.  That way you will have the command printed and can understand what is wrong
[20:23] <ultreia> disharmonic- I am sorry, I have no definite ideas. Perhaps a reinstall of kde?
[20:23] <rubiconjosh> Anyone running multiple monitors have success with making notifications appear on a monitor that is not the right-most display?
[20:23] <crawln> i understand it's not copying the file name
[20:24] <tdignan> How do I sync photos to an iphone? I'm a noob when it comes to apple stuff. Just copying the files via USB mass storage doesn't seem to make them accessible via the photo gallery
[20:24] <jrib> crawln: well for one, your variable is $i, not $file
[20:24] <tdignan> is there any tool for linux I can use to import them
[20:25] <crawln> figures i wouldn't see that lol
[20:25] <tdignan> to clarify, I didn't buy this iphone. It was given to me and I need it for a job. I personally wouldn't go out of my way to buy one :P
[20:25] <tdignan> it'd be a great phone if it ran linux instead.

[20:28] <tdignan> i's another article from 2008
[20:28] <tdignan> 5 year old instructions are not for me
[20:28] <disharmonic> ultreia, i think mesa got pulled by the Update manager and overwrote some AMD libs. Since i'm using a custom fglrx package apt probably doesn't have the mesa stuff as conflicting with fglrx
[20:28] <tdignan> it says nothing about photos, either.
[20:28] <ultreia> do those instructions no longer work?
[20:28] <_methods> tdignan: try floola
[20:28] <_methods> it works on linux now
[20:29] <disharmonic> ok time to test my theory
[20:29] <crawln> haha
[20:29]  * crawln does a happy dance
[20:30] <trism> tdignan: don't know about the iphone but for my ipad I just plug it in and use: gphoto2 -P; to copy it to the current directory
[20:30] <trism> tdignan: I imagine you could use anything that uses that lib
[20:30] <crawln> thanks jr
[20:30] <crawln> that helped alot
[20:31] <crawln> didn't realize i needed to go ${file%.mkv}.mp4 lol
[20:31] <jrib> crawln: yep
[20:32] <crawln> kept trying ${file%}.mp4
[20:32] <crawln> was like wth lol
[20:32] <Kjubert> I have a question: is the Ubuntu-Software-Center generally downloading .deb-files for installing software? Because for some software you cant find deb-packages for download online and i would like to gather these by copying possible temporary deb-packages the software-center is using. is there a way??
[20:32] <crawln> thanks man appreciated
[20:32] <jrib> crawln: you might be interested in http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Parameters
[20:32] <crawln> thanks
[20:34] <Pici> Kjubert: the software center is just a wrapper around apt-get, it downloads and installs debs. They're all available in our repositories and you can download them manually with your browser if you want too.
[20:35] <g16_> Kjubert: look into /var/cache/apt/archives
[20:37] <Kjubert> aahh... i knew the s.center was a frontend for apt. but i didn't know the repository is accessible by web interface. thanks, i just found it!
[20:37] <dinar2> hello. though my user is in plugdev, cannot write in ntfs!
[20:38] <ultreia> dinar2- is it using ntfs-3g?
[20:38] <TeckyJ> sorry hey just checking to make sure i have this irc thing working ^^;
[20:38] <Bsims> dinar2: who owns the mountpoint... ran into that
[20:40] <crawln> dinar2 one of the things i had to do is make a symlink to the folder under my home folder
[20:40] <crawln> to get deluge to be able to make folders and put files in the folders
[20:40] <dinar2> thank you
[20:40] <crawln> it wouldn't do it under /mount/folder/{new folder}
[20:40] <dinar2> that is strange, i ll try
[20:40] <disharmonic> well this is frustrating.
[20:41] <crawln> it worked for me was having issues with flexget pushing new folder commands to deluge
[20:41] <crawln> after making the symlink it worked
[20:41] <crawln> because the ntfs drive is all root:root
[20:41] <crawln> least with my system
[20:41] <crawln> and changing permissions on the folders didn't take on the ntfs drive
[20:42] <crawln> probably because of the way it mounts to the system
[20:42] <Bsims> crawln: why not just start your file manager as root
[20:42] <tdignan> thanks to everyone who helped. booting into the dark side to sync the iphone :)
[20:42] <antonio_> ciaoooooooooo
[20:42] <crawln> because it wasn't the file manager doing it
[20:42] <tdignan> one more thing I will leave you with
[20:42] <antonio_> hellooooooooooooooo
[20:42] <crawln> it was deluge getting issued the command from flexget

[20:44] <ultreia> disharmonic- no success?
[20:46] <dinar2> crawln linking helped, thank you
[20:47] <crawln> dinar2: it works because the mount is under usually /media/(mount) which you don't own
[20:47] <crawln> by bypassing the /media/ you go straight to the server

[20:52] <NielsMkn> hello
[20:52] <ultreia> disharmonic- what was the problem?
[20:53] <disharmonic> Looks like enabling tear free desktop did the trick. Or rather it seems to have worked around the issue as my mouse still disappears if i leave it static
[20:53] <disharmonic> ultreia, see above
[20:54] <NielsMkn> I have a small problem. I'm trying to install flareget on ubuntu 10.04 but I get an error as it requires libqt4-network (version >= 4.4.8)
[20:54] <fredbulah> connecting a usb hub with 3 flash drives only fires a udev rule [which creates a separate mount point for each usb device] once. all 3 devices get mounted but the affected udev rule fires only once, was expecting it to fire once per device. is this a problem or is this working as designed?
[20:54] <ultreia> disharmonic- strange about the mouse pointer
[20:55] <disharmonic> ultreia, my guess is Vsync refereshes the ui very fast but not the nouse pointer. It's not really an issue though. When i move it it imediatly reappears
=== rocky_ is now known as rocky
[20:56] <antonio_> hellllooooooooooooo
[20:56] <ultreia> disharmonic- does kde have that thing with the eyes that point to the mouse pointer?
[20:57] <NielsMkn> erm any idea how to fix this?
=== dlam is now known as dlam|away
[20:59] <crawln> NielsMkn: sudo apt-get update?
[21:00] <NielsMkn> tried that, it seems that lib qt4-network max version for ubuntu 10.04 is only 4.4.6
[21:00] <MonkeyDust> iqs this antonio a bot?
=== Paradigm|2 is now known as UltraParadigm
[21:00] <Pici> NielsMkn: I don't see flareget in any of the Ubuntu repositories.
[21:00] <MonkeyDust> !find flareget
[21:00] <ubottu> Package/file flareget does not exist in quantal
[21:01] <UltraParadigm> Can anyone point me in the right direction.  My soundcard (Soundblaster Audigy SE)  isn't listed when I do "cat /proc/asound/cards"
[21:01] <MonkeyDust> NielsMkn  consider upgrading to 12.04 or 12.10
[21:01] <NielsMkn> http://www.flareget.net16.net/
[21:02] <NielsMkn> MonkeyDust: but I don't want to work with unity :(
[21:02] <crawln> yeah the default on 12.04 is 4.4.8.1
[21:02] <Pici> NielsMkn: You don't need to use unity.
[21:02] <MonkeyDust> NielsMkn  you don't have to, install a different DE and use that, fallback is very similar to gnome2
[21:02] <ThinkT510> NielsMkn: you dont have to, there is kde, xfce, enlightenment, lxde
[21:02] <Bsims> NielsMkn: I'd suggest xfce... its rather nice
[21:04] <crawln> so would everything go boom if you installed a deb package from precise on lucid?
[21:04] <NielsMkn> Darn
[21:04] <MonkeyDust> NielsMkn  this is what gnome3 fallback looks like http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fpdM3UOam3Y/TzW6lrA9yNI/AAAAAAAAHuQ/5Wf9Xum-oxQ/s1600/ubuntu12.04-classic-session.png
[21:04] <ThinkT510> crawln: never mix different version packages
[21:04] <F3Speech> Anyone tell me how to 'fix' my putty client in ubunut. Running in windows I can copy and paste into my putty term windows, in ubuntu I cant :( makes using the term alot slower.
[21:04] <NielsMkn> MonkeyDust: gnome3 fallback is stable?
[21:05] <crawln> was wondering that myself F3Speech lol
[21:05] <crawln> never cared though just ssh'd in a term
[21:05] <ultreia> UltraParadigm- the sb audigy se has been supported under alsa using driver ca106, just not very well, many driver errors
[21:05] <F3Speech> crawln: im wondering if thats the way to go, putty is handy though
[21:06] <crawln> F3Speech: well i found that after puttying the ssh key's on the server a terminal was faster
[21:06] <crawln> F3Speech: seeing as putty requires the puttykeyring thing
[21:07] <ActionParsnip> crawln: you can may the ssh server not use DNS too, makes login faster
[21:07] <F3Speech> not noticed the keyring tbh, guess ill lookup the connection string for term then
[21:07] <MonkeyDust> NielsMkn  it's just a different 'skin' for ubuntu
[21:07] <crawln> ActionParsnip: yeah well i've only been using it for 2 days learning alot though
[21:08] <ActionParsnip> crawln: best way to learn is to use it :)
[21:08] <ultreia> NielsMkn- kde is an old standard
[21:08] <ActionParsnip> ultreia: how is it old?
[21:08] <NielsMkn> MonkeyDust: well I'm reading about it on google and some people are saying that applets like battery indicator etc didn't work properly on ubuntu 11.10
[21:08] <crawln> F3Speech: yeah i just put the ssh key on then ssh blah.com lol
[21:09] <ultreia> ActionParsnip- because kde has been around for a long time
[21:09] <MonkeyDust> NielsMkn  people complain about anything - and i mean *anything*
[21:09] <crawln> I'm thinking of trying cinnamon but not sure
[21:09] <crawln> right now i just use stock unity
[21:09] <ThinkT510> crawln: cinnamon isn't supported here
[21:09] <crawln> lol
[21:09] <ActionParsnip> ultreia: its only 1 year older than gnome
[21:09] <MonkeyDust> crawln  it's beautiful but buggy, i tried it for a few days, then deleted it
[21:10] <crawln> yeah a friend had it on his comp
[21:10] <crawln> was removed a few days later
[21:10] <ultreia> ActionParsnip- they have both been around for a long time
[21:10] <crawln> said if it ever gets polished it'll be nice
[21:10] <ActionParsnip> ultreia: I know, just wondered where you got 'old standard' from
[21:11] <ultreia> ActionParsnip- "old standard"/ old favorites, as compared to xfce for example
[21:11] <UltraParadigm> If "cat /proc/asound/cards" doesn't list my sound card, what can I do?
[21:11] <Triups> I need help with channel bonding.  I have followed tutorials that show different ways and keep failing.  Should I be using bond-master or bond-slave?  Should I be using LACP on my cisco switch or no?
[21:12] <NielsMkn> alright thanks, gtg now later
[21:12] <ultreia> UltraParadigm- that means no driver recognizes your card. you can only get a different kind of sound card
[21:13] <ActionParsnip> ultreia: favourite is an opinion. xfce was started in 1996, just like gnome
[21:13] <ultreia> ActionParsnip- xfce must have been little used in 1996, it was unheard of then
[21:14] <ActionParsnip> ultreia: possibly
[21:14] <UltraParadigm> Ultreia: is that because I installed in after installing Ubuntu?  Maybe alsa needed to compile with it or something?    Grasps at straws
[21:15] <martinalex> abend...
[21:15] <ultreia> UltraParadigm- no. you can normally install sound cards after installing linux
[21:16] <chudler> Hello. Is there a way we can test d-i partman recipes "offline" outside of the installer? Currently I develop them and don't know exactly what is going to happen until build-time.
[21:16] <martinalex> i have a problem with xfig... it doesnt use german umlauts
[21:16] <chudler> AFAICT there's not even an installable partman package.
[21:18] <ActionParsnip> martinalex: are there any bugs reported?
[21:18] <ultreia> UltraParadigm- sometimes Ceative Labs makes soundblaster cards with the same name but different chipsets, and sometimes the companies that make OEM versions of Ceative cards will do things like changing the pci ids or the eeprom contents. For whatever reason, you appear to be out of luck with this particular audigy se
[21:19] <martinalex> ActionParsnip: didnt find the bugtracker... but this problem seems to be usual
[21:20] <ThinkT510> !launchpad | martinalex
[21:20] <ubottu> martinalex: Launchpad is a collection of development services for Open Source projects. It's Ubuntu's bug tracker, and much more; see https://launchpad.net/

[21:22] <opalepatrick> when I get a system error in unity 12.10 I get a winodw popping up to report the problem,. I say yes, give password and then it disappears and comes back for a repeat three times or so. Any clues?
[21:23] <ultreia> UltraParadigm- I once long ago had a SB live made by Dell, it would work in windows but not in linux. I later got a SB live made by Creative, and it worked in both. Both cards looked the same and had the same pci id, but they did not function equally
[21:23] <opalepatrick> Doesnt seem to report - also cant work out what is broken
[21:23] <jhutchins> UltraParadigm: It would be unusual for an audigy to be completely undetected.
[21:23] <jhutchins> UltraParadigm: Does lspci show it?  lspci -nn and give us the numerical ID.
[21:24] <n-iCe> is ubuntu phone os available for download?

[21:24] <UltraParadigm> No, I'm thinking either I'm an idiot and didn't put it down correctly, or tiger sent me a defective one.
[21:24] <jhutchins> UltraParadigm: Does not show in lspci?
[21:25] <ultreia> UltraParadigm- did you not say it worked in windows 7?
[21:26] <martinalex> there should be a  possibility to get umlaute via the compose key - but it doesnt work for me either
[21:27] <UltraParadigm> jhutchins:  no, the only audio device it shows is the hdmi output for my video card.  It's not there at all, My onboard also isn't there, but I disabled that in bios so that makes since.

[21:56] <ProfessorBacon> blerp
[21:56] <hunnicutt> I have a question for developers, I imagine.
[21:56] <hunnicutt> I would like to compile nm-applet from source using the same command-line for "configure" used to compile with Ubuntu 12.04
[21:56] <subcool> i am running LiveUSB on my machine, and im mounting and moving files from my NTFS to an Ext3. I have mounted the Ext3, or im trying. It mounted under ROOT. ?? - now im trying to change owndership to user- and... im not sure how to.
[21:57] <wiggmpk1> jhutchins: ultreia: example, [REC] 3: Genesis.m4v (via FTP) _8PAM7~4.M4V (via nautilus/samba windows workgroup)
[21:57] <subcool> Being iam on a liveusb- it wont let me change the ownership to the normal user of the computer. but id' like for the folders to be atleast user permissions.
[21:57] <jhutchins> sagiet: http://xchat.org/faq/
[21:58] <hunnicutt> I have the nm-applet 0.9.4.1, fetched from git.  But I don't know how to build this for GTK-2, it seems to create a shared library which pulls in GTK 3
[21:58] <subcool> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1564369/
[21:58] <ActionParsnip> subcool: look into chmod and chown :)
[21:58] <jhutchins> wiggmpk1: Look up "samba windows shortnames"

[21:59] <subcool> ActionParsnip, i have invalid user.
[21:59] <wiggmpk1> jhutchins: thanks mate
[22:00] <ActionParsnip> subcool: is subcool your username?
[22:00] <ActionParsnip> subcool: you may have to boot to the Ubuntu OS to chown as your user
[22:00] <anthony__> ultreia: dsl. it worked fine before i went to 11.10. iv tried restarting the modem and computer. but it didnt do anything to help
[22:00] <subcool> ActionParsnip, cant i just chown "default user"
[22:00] <atrius> did ubuntu switch to the embedded glibc by default a while back?
[22:01] <subcool> ActionParsnip, instead of using a user name, i can just change the permssion manually? like 777 or something right?
[22:01] <ultreia> anthony__> ok. Is your dsl modem pppoe or bridging?

[22:01] <subcool> ActionParsnip,  yeah,

[22:10] <CuteGuy1> Hey there. I'm trying to rip some DVDs using an old IDE DVD burner hooked into an USB external enclosure. Yet my system does not mount the DVD, eve if lsusb does recognize the usb. How can I rip the DVDs? Is there any workaround to mount the DVD? Thanks in advance...
[22:10] <ultreia> anthony__> if it's not pppoe, all I can think of is that you should never try to downgrade, it breaks everything
[22:11] <jhutchins> CuteGuy1: What's on the DVDs?
[22:11] <cjae> is this for real? what will happen if I try to use the drivers for 10.10 on 12.10           http://www.hidpoint.com/hidpoint/download.html
[22:11] <MonkeyDust> CuteGuy1  do you know how to manually mount a device?
[22:11] <ultreia> cjae, don't do it
[22:12] <cjae> ultreia: why
[22:12] <CuteGuy1> jhuchins: on the DVD I got dvd files. It is not an audio DVD nor a data DVD
[22:12] <anthony__> well i did a complete unintall/reinstall. could it just be a driver that wasnt installed when 11.10 was being installed?
[22:13] <CuteGuy1> monkeydust: I do not know how to manually mount.
[22:13] <yeats> cjae: it won't be supported here in any case - if that's not reason enough, I would expect system breakage and dependency problems
[22:13] <ultreia> cjae- because the drivers for 10.10 are a different kernel version, and you will likely end up with a non-booting system, or a crippled system if you are lucky
[22:13] <ThinkT510> !mount | CuteGuy1
[22:13] <ubottu> CuteGuy1: mount is used to attach devices to directories. See also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount

[22:14] <akSeya> hello
[22:14] <CuteGuy1> Oh, Ubottu is the bot, I get it...
[22:14] <jhutchins> cjae: Given that they appear to have different downloads for each release, they're probably compiled for a specific kernel and won't work with a different one.  You could always try it.
[22:14] <akSeya> is there something wrong with irc.freenode.net?
[22:14] <akSeya> xchat just cant connect to it
[22:14] <yeats> !freenod | akSeya
[22:14] <ThinkT510> akSeya: you are on it now

[22:14] <ubottu> freenode is the IRC network that you're on! - See http://freenode.net/faq.shtml - freenode has policies that govern how people should use the network which can be read at http://freenode.net/policy.shtml - The Ubuntu channels on freenode also have their own !Guidelines
[22:14] <jhutchins> cjae: It's unlikely to cripple your system, but also unlikely to work

[22:25] <dsaj> thank you
[22:25] <ActionParsnip> wjtaylor_: got the latest BIOS?
[22:25] <ultreia> anthony__> so if this 11.10 was installed clean, something else must have changed, like your cabling or your outdoor connection.
[22:25] <wjtaylor_> yes
[22:25] <wjtaylor_> ActionParsnip: ^^
[22:26] <wjtaylor_> It's not doing it much, and didn't start doing it until I started using the touchscreen.

[22:29] <funky> hi guys, I'mtrying to set up a set of laptops for the students to use. The school's wifi uses a automatic proxy to connect to the internet. Is there any way to save the proxy setting for the guest account to use? It seems like the settings are reset after each session.
[22:29] <ultreia> anthony__> different internet provider?
[22:30] <anthony__> nope. same one. same model modem. same computer. is there a way to check thr drivers t see if there all ther and working?
[22:31] <jhutchins> anthony__: DId you look at those links I posted earlier?
[22:31] <ultreia> anthony__> I can think of one solution, but it would cost a small amount of money. Instead of directly connecting to the modem, obtain a cheap dsl-router and let it do all the work
[22:32] <jhutchins> ultreia: That's really going the wrong way for a simple connection.  He just needs to diagnose the problem and figure out what the cause is.  If it worked with 11.10 it'll work with 12.
[22:34] <anthony__> yes i did but i didnt see any thing that might fix it. and wats the difference between a modem and router. i might have them mixed up

[23:01] <bianca> i reinstalled ubuntu and now i have the same issue as last time when i try to install the graphics drivers, fglrx installation requires that the system have kernel headers.  /lib/modules/3.5.0-22-generic/build/include/linux/version.h

[23:04] <dsaj> jhutchins: I try apt-get remove vi for example, but I get the same error
[23:04] <bianca> what driver?
[23:05] <bianca> without any drivers like right now, even moving windows is laggy..
[23:05] <dpurgert> dsaj, you'll need to delete or move stuff (not vi, or programs ... saved stuff)
[23:05] <dpurgert> clear your trash, delete temporary files or old files that you've since revised
[23:06] <k1l> bianca: ubuntu has the amd driver in their software repositories

[23:12] <bianca> i dont have that either, um is 12.10 called ringtail?
[23:13] <bianca> raring ringtail*?
[23:13] <ActionParsnip> bianca: 13.04 is ringtail
[23:13] <ademone> its at the software center
[23:13] <ActionParsnip> bianca: are you running 13.04?
[23:13] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, "Best Practice" ... um, not using NTFS? :) (I know ... )
[23:13] <ActionParsnip> ademone: what did you install?
[23:13] <yeats> ademone: okay - let's back up... what are you trying to accomplish here?
[23:13] <bianca> no? i dont know what that is im running 12.10
[23:13] <ActionParsnip> bianca: thats Quantal
[23:13] <k1l> bianca: go to settings and then software-soures. there should be a last tab with additional drivers
[23:14] <dpurgert> yeats -- he apparently did something "bad" with a USB flash drive (didn't eject it properly?) and now it's misbehaving under his ubuntu install
[23:14] <shwaiil> yeats: http://pastebin.com/AV3hrYmW
[23:14] <harta_> i ran sudo dpkg --configure -a to fix a problem that occured during an interupted update and now it is stuck on Setting up python2.7-minimal (2.7.1-5ubuntu2.2) ...  this was my first update after OS installation
[23:14] <yeats> dpurgert: ah - thanks - I didn't realize he had shared anything previously
[23:15] <bianca> which one is better, proprietary or proprietary updates
[23:15] <shwaiil> yeats: I just added a new path to the .bashrc and this started happening I just need to find the file and delete the lines, but don't know how to show hiddne files through the GUI
[23:15] <histo> !better | bianca
[23:15] <ubottu> bianca: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[23:15] <ActionParsnip> "23:12 < ademone> i installed it on my ubuntu"    what does this mean?
[23:15] <bianca> lol..
[23:15] <dpurgert> yeats, yeah, I'm kinda getting it in pieces myself -- ActionParsnip clarified it for me
[23:15] <yeats> shwaiil: you can do '/usr/bin/vi <file>'
[23:15] <bianca> well how do i pick one
[23:16] <histo> bianca: under the settings manager there is a additional drivers applicaiton
[23:16] <ademone> ussualy when i plug my external HDD it mounts it automatically, but now it cant be mounted not even with the partition manager gparted, i tried sudo mount -a but no response, the partition manager cant recognise the file system
[23:16] <dpurgert> shwaiil, force it with /usr/bi... blast! beaten to it
[23:16] <yeats> dpurgert: :-D
[23:16] <bianca> yes im there, they are the same except one says updates at the end
[23:16] <subcool> how do i deteremine where grub is?
[23:16] <subcool> which partition
[23:16] <histo> ademone: does dmesg show that the drive is being seen
[23:16] <k1l> bianca: take the updates.
[23:16] <dpurgert> subcool, it's on the MBR of your HDD.
[23:16] <yeats> ademone: gparted is not the solution here, then
[23:17] <bianca> im guessing that means its one that recieves updates and the other doesnt?
[23:17] <ademone> with the sudo fdisk -l i can see it
[23:17] <dpurgert> yeats, it probably is ... just not in the way he hopes ...
[23:17] <anthony__> CAN ANYONE HELP WITH MY WIRED NETWORK PROBLEM. UBUNTU 11.10
[23:17] <ActionParsnip> anthony__: please kill the caps
[23:17] <dpurgert> anthony__, 1. stop yelling.  2. what's your problem?
[23:18] <subcool> dpurgert, ademone - yeah, i just formated my sda1 that had ntfs- and i want to make sure i have it backed up or something before i enter hell
[23:18] <ActionParsnip> ademone: see what?
[23:18] <dpurgert> um, you formatted the drive?
[23:18] <ActionParsnip> ademone: what is 'it'?
[23:18] <subcool> dpurgert, partition
[23:19] <ActionParsnip> ademone: when you last unplugged the drive, did you use the 'safely remove' feature in your OS?
[23:19] <ActionParsnip> ademone: or did you just unplug it
[23:20] <ademone> i cant remember, i think just an unplug, i havent use it for a long time
[23:20] <dpurgert> ah, misread :) ... the MBR is "outside" of the addressable /dev/sd[a-z][0-9] space
[23:20] <dpurgert> so you should be OK
[23:20] <iceroot> could someone please tell me what is the english string in nm-applet for ipv4 to send the hostname to dhcp. should be something like "dhcp client name"
[23:20] <ActionParsnip> ademone: then you are mistreating your hardware
[23:20] <ActionParsnip> ademone: is the file system NTFS ?
[23:20] <Schumi23`> Hi! Is there  a place to report bugs with Ubuntu? Like Bugzilla with Mozilla, but for Ubuntu?
[23:20] <ademone> propably sir, i am not sure
[23:20] <dpurgert> though you'll probably have a broken grub because there used to be something there (presumably, windows?)
[23:21] <ActionParsnip> ademone: then this is especially important if you intend to use it in Ubuntu too
[23:21] <somnambulant> ademone: blkid /dev/sdxy
[23:21] <ademone> i am sure its not ex something
[23:21] <bean> Schumi23`: sure there is, but first you are going to want to be sure that it's a bug.
[23:21] <dpurgert> so go and run 'sudo update-grub' to make a new menu/bootloader
[23:21] <ActionParsnip> ademone: shove the drive in a Windows PC, chkdsk the partition then in the bottom right, use the safely remove feature.
[23:21] <ActionParsnip> ademone: you'll probably find it is then ok
[23:22] <ademone> i tried it but the windows says me to format it
[23:22] <iceroot> !bug | Schumi23`
[23:22] <ubottu> Schumi23`: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please file a bug using the command ¬´ ubuntu-bug <package> ¬ª - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.
[23:22] <dpurgert> iceroot,  nm-applet ... you mean network manager?
[23:22] <iceroot> dpurgert: yes
[23:23] <dpurgert> from what I can see, setting "Automatic (DHCP)" leaves no configuration options ...
[23:23] <ademone> should i try blkid /dev/sdb?
[23:23] <anthony__> iv been tryin to get help for an hour now. my computer wont connect to my network. its wired correctly and my internet works. ii cycled the power on both. didnt do anything
=== raven_ is now known as bianca
[23:23] <bianca> thanks guys :)
[23:23] <dpurgert> anthony__, what's the output of ifconfig ?
[23:23] <jhutchins> anthony__: Did you look at those links I sent you?
[23:24] <iceroot> dpurgert: its for an existing connecting inside the ipv4 tag
[23:24] <jhutchins> anthony__: Pretty sure it's been more than an hour.
[23:24] <dpurgert> iceroot, not really sure -- I edit configs manually ... um, lemme try digging around
[23:24] <jhutchins> dpurgert: Right, with DHCP all of the options are set from the server.
[23:25] <jhutchins> dpurgert: With a text-based config you can override some of them.
[23:25] <iceroot> dpurgert: i am facing a bug? that since 12.04 my system is not reporting the hostname to the router, so i cant use hostnames on my network, when i enter my hostname manually in that field its working, so i want to create a bug
[23:26] <bean> !bug | iceroot
[23:26] <ubottu> iceroot: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please file a bug using the command ¬´ ubuntu-bug <package> ¬ª - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.
[23:26] <dpurgert> iceroot, um, sounds more like an issue with your router having wrong (internal) DNS information than anything
[23:26] <iceroot> bean: yes i know...
[23:26] <iceroot> bean: read my text...
[23:26] <iceroot> dpurgert: how should my router get the dns information when the client is not sending them?
[23:26] <shwaiil> yeats: thanks it worked
[23:26] <steed> hello from Hellas
[23:27] <dpurgert> iceroot,  it would have it because it generates the DNS table when the host asks for an IP address lease
[23:27] <subcool> dpurgert, k- thanks..
[23:28] <yeats> shwaiil: great
[23:28] <dpurgert> subcool, um, what'd I do?
[23:28] <iceroot> dpurgert: hm ok, i thought the field http://alpha-unix.de/~iceroot/ubuntu/nm-applet.png  "DHCP CLient-Kennung" needs to be filled by default
[23:28] <iceroot> dpurgert: when doing it by hand as the screen shows, my router is showing the hostname instead of the ip for connected devices
[23:28] <anthony__> yes. im using 11.10. not 10.04. the output is a bunch of numbers and letters. i cant copy and paste cause im on my tablet
[23:28] <jhutchins> anthony__: You can read them.
[23:29] <bianca> arrrgh i love you guys
[23:29] <jhutchins> anthony__: Are you getting an ip4 address?
[23:29] <bianca> <3
[23:29] <subcool> dpurgert, you helped me understand MBR and grub
[23:29] <dpurgert> iceroot, that's a client identifier, not the system hostname (in theory ... could be the same I suppose ... like I said, I don't use network manager)
[23:29] <anthony__> im not typing thewhole thing out. its too much
[23:29] <k1l_> bianca: keep in mind, that searching in the ubuntu-repos is the first way to do.no donwloading anywhere :)
[23:30] <bean> anthony__: well, we have to have information to help.
[23:30] <jhutchins> bianca: You got it working?
[23:30] <bianca> :)
[23:30] <dpurgert> anthony__, do ifconfig | pastebinit (note, pastebin command might be misspelt)
[23:30] <bean> dpurgert: he doesn't have network... so that won't really work
[23:30] <bianca> yeah, hardware acceleration and everything :3
[23:30] <iceroot> dpurgert: i will have a look if there are known bugs for "fritzbox" because it was working some time ago then i changed my fritzbox and upgraded to 12.04 :)
[23:31] <ademone> anyone?
[23:31] <dpurgert> bean, I assumed (incorrectly it seems) that he was on the same machine, maybe wireless
[23:31] <anthony__> wat do u neet? the inet6 addr?
[23:31] <dpurgert> anthony__, are you using ipv6 across your network, or ipv4 ?
[23:32] <ActionParsnip> ademone: if windows says to format it then the FAT may be damaged
[23:32] <iceroot> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp/+bug/115426
[23:33] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 115426 in dhcp (Ubuntu) "Computer name is not recognized by DHCP of FRITZ!Box" [Low,Confirmed]
[23:33] <ademone> can i do something? or i have to format the HDD
[23:33] <anthony__> ipv6 i think. but im not positive
[23:33] <ActionParsnip> ademone: i'd format it then restore data from backup
[23:33] <ademone> how
[23:34] <ademone> this disk is my backup
[23:34] <bean> anthony__: well, we can't really help without more info then... Can you like, even, take a picture of it and upload it somewhere?
[23:35] <jhutchins> bianca: What did you end up with that finally worked?
[23:35] <dpurgert> actually -- if you're using IPV4, you'll see both ... do you see one (e.g. 192.168.1.100, or 169.x.x.x)?
[23:36] <steed> nvidia drivers are necessary on ubuntu?
[23:36] <bean> steed: video drivers are necessary on any os
[23:36] <anthony__> i thought of a way. but itll take a couple minutes
[23:37] <steed> bean i use now the aytomatic drivers nuveau, nuveau are nvidia?
[23:37] <jhutchins> dpurgert: It's unlikely pastbinit will work if he doesn't have a network connection.
[23:37] <bianca> that additional drivers thing seems to really work, xD with the update driver, plus the hardware acceleration part near the bottom of this tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI#Installing_via_the_command_line
[23:37] <dpurgert> jhutchins, yeah ... figured he was making do with a (USB) wifi card ...
[23:37] <jhutchins> anthony__: If you're going to keep trying to do things other than answer the questions you're asked you're not going to get it fixed.
[23:38] <ActionParsnip> ademone: then format the device and then make a fresh backup (if the device is the backup then the original data still stands)
[23:38] <jhutchins> anthony__: You don't need to paste the output of the commands, you need to read and understand it.
[23:38] <bianca> although it did say it wasnt working after i first put them 2 lines in for the harware acceleration, but it was working after i restarted so :)
[23:38] <ademone> yeah but i have data that i dont have on my desktop
[23:38] <jhutchins> bianca: Great, now those of us who DON'T have nvida can pass that along!
[23:39] <ademone> at the external HDD i mean
[23:39] <jhutchins> ademone: Not if you formatted it.
[23:40] <iceroot> dpurgert: just for your info, its a fritzbox bug and an ubuntu bug, ubuntu is not sending the correct identifier and the fritzbox is then ignoring the complete hostname task https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp/+bug/115426/comments/6
[23:40] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 115426 in dhcp (Ubuntu) "Computer name is not recognized by DHCP of FRITZ!Box" [Low,Confirmed]
[23:40] <bianca> noo its amd :3
[23:40] <ademone> jhutchins: i cant understand
[23:40] <ActionParsnip> ademone: then you could use foremost to maybe get data back. You will need an equal amount of writable free space as foremost will spit all files out that it finds to the folder
[23:40] <bianca> oh >< nvm
[23:40] <ActionParsnip> ademone: you will also lost file names
[23:40] <anthony__> i understand most of it. but wat do i need this info for. what do i do with it
[23:41] <bean> anthony__: we just need to know if it has a valid address
[23:42] <bean> anthony__: what is the output of "ip addr"
[23:42] <anthony__> so wat do i need to do then
[23:42] <jhutchins> anthony__: Seeing if you have an address is the first step of seeing if you can connect.
[23:42] <ActionParsnip> ademone: foremost is not perfect, files may be damaged too, so you may only get halfimages etc.
[23:42] <jhutchins> anthony__: You still haven't answered the question of whether you have an ipv4 address.
[23:43] <ademone> ahh
[23:43] <blob4000> is this the right channel to ask about building a package (virtualbox-guest-additions-iso) from source, so that i can make a small change in the source before installing?
=== ukdkbr is now known as hxqxoe
[23:43] <ActionParsnip> ademone: I suggest you review your backup regime, it is clearly not appropriate
[23:44] <bean> anthony__: what is the output of "ip addr"
[23:44] <blob4000> i'm using apt-get source to get the package's source, i just want to know the next steps for working with the tar.gz source, making changes, and recompiling + installing
[23:44] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, I send the important stuff to FTP ;)
[23:44] <bean> i just dont back up anything
[23:44] <bean> and write all docs, etc, on google dos
[23:44] <ActionParsnip> bean: that'll bite you in the ass one day
[23:45] <bean> ActionParsnip: eh, i just try to keep everything important in the cloud
[23:45] <bean> aware that its bad practice though
[23:45] <ademone> thanx a lot
[23:45] <ActionParsnip> bean: thats a backup then :)
[23:45] <bean> is certainly not what I do at work
[23:45] <bean> :p
[23:45] <ademone> i propably will lose my files
[23:45] <ActionParsnip> bean: not bad practice, its pretty sweet
[23:45] <ademone> :(
[23:45] <dpurgert> ... trouble is, it doesn't seem to get mirrored anywhere :)  ... guess we can't all be good enough for that to happen
[23:45] <bean> ActionParsnip: certainly means more disk space for the disposable files
[23:46] <ActionParsnip> ademone: try foremost. you should run a better backup, you wouldn't have an issue then. that's what a backup is to prevent
[23:46] <anthony__> im lookin at "inet6" "hwaddr" those are the 2 addrresses from "ifconfig eth0". "ip addr" gives mostly the same
[23:47] <ActionParsnip> bean: I have about 1Gb of data in $HOME, the rest is on my file server
[23:47] <bean> makes sense
[23:47] <dpurgert> anthony__, is there an ipv4 address? (i.e. inet addr:192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x or something)
=== Guest80803 is now known as ryanclancy000
[23:48] <wjtaylor_> anyone know of a util that will stress test my video card?
[23:49] <jhutchins> anthony__: You still haven't told us if you have an ipv4 address.
[23:49] <anthony__> no. just one with numbers and letters
=== c_smith is now known as c_smith_away
[23:50] <jhutchins> anthony__: Ok, so we know at least that you don't have an address.
[23:50] <dpurgert> odd that you're running ipv6-only on a home network.  you have an IPV6-only address on the computer you're using to talk to us?
[23:50] <bean> dpurgert: he's on his tablet.
[23:51] <bean> anthony__: what happens when you type "dhclient eth0"
[23:51] <anthony__> i have inet6 nothin that looks like ipv4.
[23:51] <jhutchins> anthony__: Do you have link lights on the computer & the modem?
[23:51] <dpurgert> bean, tablet is still a computer, and shou... ohhhh, 3G?
[23:51] <bean> dpurgert: no, its just his computer can't get an address from the router over the wire, it sounds like
[23:51] <iceroot> which dhcpclient is network-manager using by default? dhcp3-client is not installed on this system and i dont know any other clients
[23:51] <jhutchins> dpurgert: Not odd, cards auto-configure ipv6 even if they don't have a connection.
[23:52] <dpurgert> bean, right -- trying to get a test case from a working connection ...
=== c_smith_away is now known as c_smith
[23:53] <dpurgert> jhutchins, and would, in theory also have a 169.x.x.x IPV4 address (unless Ubuntu just straight doesn't show it ... )
[23:53] <jhutchins> anthony__: Do you have link lights on the computer & the modem?
[23:53] <anthony__> yes i have link lights. thats the first thing i checked. and i put in ddhclient eth0. nothing happend. no output
[23:53] <jhutchins> dpurgert: No, not on linux.
[23:53] <bean> anthony__: ok, now does ifconfig eth0 show an address?
[23:53] <jhutchins> bean: He said he didn't have ipv4.  Hasn't told us if the link lights are on.
[23:54] <dpurgert> jhutchins, fair enough ... been a while since I've fought with the connection ...
[23:54] <bean> jhutchins: i told him to run dhclient eth0
[23:54] <bean> hoping that i'd grab one
[23:54] <jhutchins> He's hopeless, I give up.  G'nite guys.
[23:54] <dpurgert> anthony__, you spelled it wrong -- it's "dhclient eth0" ... not "ddhclient..."
[23:54] <bean> anthony__: does "ifconfig eth0" show "UP BROADCAST MULTICAST" somewhere
[23:54] <dpurgert> g'nite
[23:57] <anthony__> ifconfig eth0 shows hwaddr and inet6. it shows UP BOADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST. and i spelled dhclient wrong on herr cuse im on my tablet and its hardv to type
[23:57] <dpurgert> anthony__, ok, no worries :)
[23:58] <bean> anthony__: okay, does "dig +short google.com" work
[23:59] <dpurgert> jhutchins, wait ... isn't the 169.254.0.0/16 block part of some RFC?
