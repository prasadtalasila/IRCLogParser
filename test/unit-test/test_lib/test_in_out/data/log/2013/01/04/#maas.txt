[00:11] <bstillwell> This page mentions the maas server port is 5240, but according to netstat I don't have anything listening on that port:
[00:11] <bstillwell> https://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/quantal/juju-quick-start.html#now-juju
[00:11] <bstillwell> I see 5242 being a possible port
[00:15] <bstillwell> Found a page that says to use port 80 which seems to be taking me further.
[00:18] <bigjools> sorry got distracted
[00:19] <bigjools> 5240 is the port if it gets run up in a development environment
[00:19] <bigjools> otherwise it uses a wsgi plugin for Apache
