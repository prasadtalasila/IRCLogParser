[15:03] <Nivex> My Nexus One is getting long in the tooth. I'm considering a Nexus 4 as a congrats to myself for the new job, but I'm also curious to see what the Ubuntu phone thing is gonna do.
[15:04] <Nivex> My question is: Is it likely that the Ubuntu phone OS will run on the Nexus 4 once it's released?
