[00:00] <WanderingEnder> Its basically the CLI version of the desktop upgrade, Ziber.
[00:00] <Ziber> Well, they're talking about using the GUI... How do I do it at the commandline?
[00:00] <jrib> Ziber: scroll down to the server section
[00:01] <Ziber> I don't see it.
[00:01] <bond__> blami: you know how to check for MSS in ubuntu?
[00:01] <jrib> Ziber: what page are you reading?
[00:02] <Ziber> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade
[00:02] <WanderingEnder> These docs need updated.
[00:02] <WanderingEnder> desktop is only for desktop users. No info for server.
[00:02] <jrib> Ziber: yes, that tells you how to upgrade 12.04 desktop to 12.10.  Try the other link...
[00:02] <Ziber> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade ?
[00:02] <jrib> !upgrade
[00:02] <ubottu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[00:02] <WanderingEnder> EOL is ancient talks about getting up to 10.04 in the future.
[00:02] <Ziber> the upgradenotes one?
[00:03] <jrib> it's true, the documents need some tlc
[00:03] <jrib> Ziber: yes
[00:03] <WanderingEnder> UpgradeNotes stops at 11.04 to 11.10
[00:03] <jrib> Ziber: it gives you the steps, but you may or may not need to change your repositories. We'll help you cross that bridge when you get there
[00:03] <Rage1> Can I use recovery mode to undo an upgrade?
[00:03] <jrib> Rage1: depends on what you mean by "undo"
[00:03] <Ziber> Yeah, I don't see anything about server there.
[00:04] <jrib> Ziber: did you click on the link for your version?
[00:04] <Ziber> oh, nevermind. found it.
[00:04] <Rage1> to reset my computer back to 10.04
[00:04] <WanderingEnder> Ziber: "server" just means there's no GUI.
[00:04] <jrib> Rage1: no
[00:04] <Rage1> aw...

[00:05] <WanderingEnder> I'm running "Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS" which I installed lbuntu on top of. What I do in CLI is no different than on a straight server version.
[00:05] <Slart> !downgrade | Rage1
[00:05] <ubottu> Rage1: Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported and may break your system.
[00:05] <Rage1> I've been desperately trying to somehow downgrade/reinstall ubuntu back to 10.04
[00:05] <Rage1> and I already know that
[00:05] <WanderingEnder> Heck, this box isn't even in the same country I am in.
[00:05] <jrib> Rage1: what version are you on now?
[00:05] <Rage1> 12.04 LTS
[00:06] <WanderingEnder> Rage1, the way to downgrade is to backup your data and install 10.04.
[00:06] <jrib> Rage1: why do you want to downgrade?
[00:06] <Rage1> constant error messages
[00:06] <WanderingEnder> Why you're doing that, I don't know, but that's the safest way.
[00:06] <Rage1> programs failing
[00:06] <WanderingEnder> About?
[00:06] <jrib> Rage1: like?
[00:06] <Rage1> printer not working
[00:06] <Rage1> uh...
[00:07] <Rage1> stuff like drapes and adblockplus are crashing
[00:07] <crackguy> can I ask CentOS related questions here? #centos is pretty dead if that's okay?
[00:07] <macmartine> Unicorn is all of a sudden failing to start and telling me to look in stderr. Where is that?
[00:07] <jrib> crackguy: only ubuntu here.  Maybe try ##linux
[00:07] <Rage1> and I keep getting a bunch of internal errors
[00:07] <crackguy> jrib, ##linux is dead too! :(
[00:08] <WanderingEnder> Rage1, format your PC, install 10.04. That's how you do it. The proper response is to diagnose wtf is going on, though.
=== root_ is now known as otherenergy
[00:08] <Rage1> I'm not very smart when it comes to computer errors and this stuff
[00:08] <jrib> Rage1: have you tried creating a fresh new user to see if it continues?
[00:08] <Rage1> No.
[00:08] <jrib> Rage1: could be worth a shot
[00:09] <vith> in /etc/apt/preferences when specifying to pin by origin, is the domain name the only way? i want to be more specific than "ppa.launchpad.net". i'm trying to pin ppa:izx/ovz-libc or http://ppa.launchpad.net/izx/ovz-libc/
[00:09] <Rage1> If I create a new user will I have to change a bunch of stuff?
[00:09] <Slart> Rage1: if you're experiencing lots of crashing you might want to run a memory check as well
[00:09] <jrib> Rage1: well you won't retain your customizations but you're doing this to see if the errors stop
[00:10] <Rage1> and do you mean deleting my old user and creating a new one?
[00:10] <WanderingEnder> Rage1, did your PC come with Ubuntu from the store?
[00:10] <jrib> Rage1: no.  Just create a new one
[00:10] <Rage1> NO
[00:10] <Rage1> No
[00:10] <Rage1> I installed it
[00:10] <WanderingEnder> Rage1, do you know how to create a new user?
[00:10] <Rage1> No...
[00:11] <jrib> !pinning | vith
[00:11] <ubottu> vith: pinning is an advanced feature that APT can use to prefer particular packages over others. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
[00:11] <jrib> vith: there's some discussion there.  What do you want to do exactly?
[00:11] <WanderingEnder> That's what I thought. I can't remember the bot trigger for that. I would suggest help.ubuntu.com and search for "create new user"

[00:11] <Baribal> Hi again. I'm trying to follow this tutorial to upgrade 12.04 -> 12.10: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/QuantalUpgrades     When running do-release-upgrade, I get no new release offered. Should the value of Prompt in /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades something other than lts?
[00:12] <WanderingEnder> Baribal, yes, it should.
[00:12] <jrib> Baribal: yes, see the comments at the top of that file
[00:12] <w3bcrawler> does anyone know which repo's (if any) vmware can be downloaded from? it's not showing up when i use 'apt-cache search vmware'
[00:12] <WanderingEnder> LTS means you won't get a dist upgrade till the next LTS version.
[00:12] <jrib> !vmware | w3bcrawler
[00:12] <ubottu> w3bcrawler: VMWare is not available in the Ubuntu repositories. Consider using !QEmu or !VirtualBox as alternatives. Instructions for installing VMWare manually are at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware
[00:12] <WanderingEnder> Which is what, 2014?
[00:12] <jrib> w3bcrawler: not sure there is a repo
[00:12] <Baribal> Okay, thanks, that's stress blindness. ^^
[00:12] <jrib> WanderingEnder: yes
[00:12] <w3bcrawler> Thanks jrib! :D
[00:13] <MK`> Is there a way to get Ubuntu to remember to set the sound device to my headphones when I plug them in? I need to keep doing it manually.
[00:13] <vith> jrib: i want to do something like "Pin: origin ppa.launchpad.net/izx/ovz-libc/". will that work with the subdirectories specified that way?
[00:13] <vith> every example i see only has a base domain name after origin
[00:13] <jrib> vith: I'm not sure.  Can't you just pin the package?
[00:14] <jrib> vith: are you trying to make sure only the ppa version is installed?
[00:14] <ozzloy> rhythmbox isn't playing flac for me.  12.04.  i'm unable to find the solution using google (so far).  how do i get flac playback in rhythmbox?
[00:15] <vith> i could, but i thought i could make it easier on myself pinning the whole ppa since there's several packages
[00:15] <vith> but yeah, i'm on an openvz vps with an old kernel version so i have to keep this version of libc installed
[00:15] <vith> now that i'm trying to install build-essential it's getting more complicated
[00:16] <jrib> vith: the debian documentation linked to from ubottu's link tells you about all the possibilities and where the you can find the files with the details for each repository

[00:19] <roasted> hello!
[00:19] <gonzojive> I'm getting a kernel-panic on a lived that was working 10 minutes ago
[00:19] <roasted> Question - I have a hard drive here I want to back up. If I use rsync -a, will it effectively back it up? Or should I just use dd or clonezilla?
[00:20] <gonzojive> that is the livecd hangs at the loading screen
[00:20] <roasted> back up as in, I want to transfer the entire OS too
[00:20] <gonzojive> but before it was booting up properly.  this is 12.04

[00:25] <bond__> thanks kunji and Slart,  do you also know how to check for Tcp initial window size? /proc/sys/net/ivp4/ didn't helped me
[00:25] <kunji> tripelb: Hey, I've been reading up on it, but while I did have it work in the past, I didn't encounter the same problems you did, so I'm probably not going to be that much help.  I'll send anything I find that fits those symptoms your way though.
[00:25] <javierf_> Hi! I installed fresh ubuntu last time in 11.04, being upgrading since them until 12.10. But I carry some minor bugs, little things that don't work anymore as they should. I've decided to format my hard drive and install everything from new, but after so long time there are many things I will loose, like the applications installed. Is there a way to save the list of what I have installed and use it after the ubuntu install to have them back? thanks!
[00:25] <jrib> !clone | javierf_
[00:25] <ubottu> javierf_: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type « aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages », move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type « sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install » (this may cause problems with multiarch before 12.10) - See also !automate

[00:26] <kunji> bond__:initial window size, hmm, haven't got a clue, I've got a feeling it's done by the driver and there might not be a standard way to check it, that's just a guess though.

[00:28] <bond__> Slart: googling didn't help me either :(
[00:28] <bekks> ixio2b: No, there is no such tool on the level where dd operates.
[00:28] <holysin> use windows instead

[00:31] <bekks> kunji: No. Even for an image file, you cant dd just a single file from within your image file.
[00:31] <Slart> does dd even know about files and such? isn't it all just blocks?
[00:31] <vith> jrib: alright, i think i got it with "Pin: release o=LP-PPA-izx-ovz-libc" which i got from apt-get policy. thanks
[00:31] <jrib> vith: cool
[00:31] <bekks> Slart: dd has no clue about filesystems.
[00:31] <kunji> ixio2b: So I think you could shrink your partition with gparted, then use dd-rescue to copy it.  You take the risk that something could go wrong during the partition shrinking though.
[00:32] <kunji> bekks: I didn't mean a single file from the image, but what I meant was the image file is a single file in your filesystem... so it's not correct to say it can't at all
[00:33] <Slart> bekks: mm.. thought so =) thanks
[00:33] <questionaire> jrib: it is showing for install now....but its showing 149MB data for installation,,,,,is it ok....skype file from MS is only 25-35mb something
[00:33] <bekks> kunji: dd can handle block devices, and it treats an image file as a block device.
[00:33] <javierf_> if I want to replicate my packages in a fresh install of ubuntu, I will repeat the minor bugs I'm experiencing now, am not I? (because I will keep my home configutation files)
[00:33] <jrib> questionaire: you probably need some dependencies.  I don't know
[00:34] <jrib> javierf_: if the erratic behavior is caused by your configuration, sure.  Why don't you create a fresh new user and see if the "bugs" go away/

[00:37] <emx> i noticed that when a process was idle for a certain period of time i sort of have to wake it up. e.g. the terminal: i press down the enter key and a command prompt appears. a certain time passes and another one appears. the intervals get shorter and shorter until it behaves as expected. can i pass a kernel parameter or something to change this "waking-up behaviour" to "just do your job"?
[00:37] <jrib> questionaire: what's wrong with the repositories?
[00:38] <questionaire> jrib: nothing but on the above 2 links its only 3 stpes with different files
[00:38] <jrib> questionaire: use the repository version
[00:39] <ixio2b> how would I find *.vmdk
[00:39] <questionaire> ok...but if u'll look at those for few seconds then good enough just 6 lines of commands to read
[00:40] <jrib> questionaire: I saw them
[00:40] <questionaire> ok...they are not worth ?

[00:55] <topper4125> hmm... krabador_ I'll have to do some quick reading on what exactly heppened in todays update to see what the changes were... is the issue bad enough for you that you could revert to the older kernel or do you need the newest one for other reasons?
[00:55] <Rage1> can someone help me with a problem with my printer in 12.04?

[00:56] <ubottu> Ragel: Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu
[00:56] <krabador_> topper4125, no, no reason to use the newest
[00:56] <dr_willis> airplane mode on a computer? never noticed that befor
[00:56] <krabador_> topper4125, i can come back to the older with no problems
[00:56] <tripelb> Can I install Ubuntu on a ppc Mac not GUI as I can see the text as it messes up?
[00:56] <Rage1> I just need help with the printer not printing
[00:56] <brizilubuntu> u mean we cant install windows 7 on external hard drive
[00:56] <brizilubuntu> ?
[00:56] <kunji> dr_willis: lol, yeah, it's because of the "Convergence"... the phone and tv stuff
[00:56] <tompa> Hello how do i change my file manager to show folders in list view?
[00:56] <bekks> brizilubuntu: Thats a question for ##windows
[00:57] <topper4125> krabador_ I'm not saying that's the *only* solution to this issue, but it maybe the fastest if its a bit of a problem for you.
[00:57] <dr_willis> tripelb:   Ive had Ubuntu on my old PPC mac. but i always had problems with it. and the mac was so old.. it was a hassle. but it should be doable
[00:57] <Rage1> the printer works
[00:57] <brizilubuntu> i have ubuntu ?
[00:57] <Rage1> but there's something wrong with the configuration
[00:57] <KoolAid> I'm not finding any help with my question. Is there a more suitable channel to ask in?
[00:57] <Rage1> ##linuz
[00:57] <Rage1> ##linux
[00:57] <mega1> i have a small problem when i use putty and type exit it useto close now it does not anyone know why
[00:58] <w3bcrawler> tompa: that depends on the file manager you're using. I'm using 'thunar' and it's in the 'View' menu.
[00:58] <krabador_> topper4125, i must use the nvidia official with this videocard, because nouveau are really really slow
[00:58] <brizilubuntu> so shal i reinstall windows on my laptop an then create an external hard drive fro ubuntu 12.04
[00:58] <krabador_> topper4125, unusable
[00:58] <brizilubuntu> will that work
[00:58] <krabador_> topper4125,  it's a shitty geforce fx 5900
[00:58] <Rage1> topper4125
[00:58] <dr_willis> brizilubuntu:  ive ran ubuntu from external usb hds, works decently well
[00:59] <topper4125> krabador_ k... looking to see what was in todays update and if anything is mentioned about the 173
[00:59] <Haematoma> Anyone have experience configuring postfix or CLI email?
[00:59] <w3bcrawler> tompa: If there's a 'Help' menu, go to 'About' and perhaps try Googling how to change settings in your file manager (probably either nautilus or thunar)
[00:59] <KoolAid> I tried re-installing an earlier version when I encountered the problem before. I later did a partial update before the up-grade. I'm having problems since the upgrade
[00:59] <Haematoma> I'm attempting to set up postfix to use with mail so that I can send myself update emails at the end of a maintenance script.
[00:59] <brizilubuntu> how can i can you give me the link or else any other option i am new to this please
[01:00] <tompa> w3bcrawler im using the one which is default in 12.04
[01:00] <bekks> brizilubuntu: The channel you have to ask wether you can install Win7 on an external disk is ##windows
[01:00] <dr_willis> brizilubuntu:  i install to external same as i do internal. I  always manually partion and tell it where to put / at on the  external (same as i do on internal) and be sure grub installs to the external also.
[01:00] <bekks> brizilubuntu: Currently, you are in #ubuntu
[01:00] <w3bcrawler> tompa: are you using Gnome or KDE?
[01:00] <dr_willis> brizilubuntu:  or just unplug the internal so you onluy have an external. :) then you cant make a mistake
[01:00] <Rage1> topper4125: for some reason the printer works and everything, but it says that the configuration is wrong.
[01:00] <KoolAid> Has anyone else encountered the problem of "Airplanemode" on and unable to disable it?
[01:01] <tompa> w3bcrawler im using unity
[01:01] <trickyj> Hi all
[01:02] <KoolAid> I was looking for a place to deal with questions about Ubuntu. I keep finding this channel and the forum. Where can I find information?
[01:02] <KoolAid> I am not getting any responses
[01:03] <topper4125> krabador_ Really not finding anything new for the fx 5900 since mid December, nothing about the latest update...

[01:03] <eduardo__> join  #ubuntu-br
[01:03] <kunji> KoolAid: you can find information in both places: I haven't had the problem you're having though, I've never turned on airplane mode.  On IRC you need to be patient... very patient, and if you annoy people they won't answer you at all even if they know :P
[01:03] <krabador_> topper4125, ok i'll use the older kernel

[01:04] <KoolAid> thanks kunji. I never enabled airplane mode to begin with.
[01:04] <topper4125> krabador_ you're welcome, wish I could have been a bit more helpful...
[01:04] <brizilubuntu> if not can u let me now the alternate bcoz i need windows
[01:05] <kunji> KoolAid: Yeah, I've never had it start on either though, I have no idea how it interacts with the rest of networking on Ubuntu.
[01:05] <topper4125> Ragel the printer you are having problems with, is it a HP 2112 for example?
[01:05] <Rage1> It's a canon ip2600
[01:05] <KoolAid> I closed my wireless connection to use a wire. Hasn't come back on since and I keep trying different things. Don't really want to re-install if I can repair it.
[01:05] <aguitel> how install nvidia-173 in 12.10 ?
[01:05] <mega1> briziubuntu you cant use ubuntu to install windows 7 you can only install windows from cd or iso image
[01:05] <magiK_> I do have to say that Xubuntu loads allot faster than the regular Ubuntu,  I do have the option for both but running in Xubuntu mode seems to go a heck of allot faster.

[01:06] <topper4125> Ragel, have you tried this: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=129350
[01:07] <Rage1> I don't use archlinux, topper4125
[01:07] <brizilubuntu> mega1 ok i got that but after creating a CD of windows 7  i dont know how to proceed
[01:07] <kunji> topper4125: I think it's Rage1 not Ragel.  (One not Ell)
[01:07] <Rage1> yesh :D
[01:08] <topper4125> The Arch solution uses cups... same as ubuntu... should be comperable Rage1 (sorry for the typo.. not on my system and this IRC client is 'odd')
[01:08] <topper4125> maybe not the same... but comperable
[01:08] <KoolAid> thanks kunji. I don't know what's causing it. I had a dropping connection and that fixed. Now I just want to be able to connect via wireless too.
[01:08] <Rage1> ah I see
[01:08] <tripelb> Uh oh. No posts here means lots most connection
[01:09] <tripelb> Lost
[01:09] <tripelb> In cyberspace
[01:09] <tripelb> No one can hear me
[01:09] <kunji> tripelb: I can here you!
[01:09] <topper4125> Rage1, should give you a step in the right direction.

[01:10] <un2him> MagiK...I'm trying xubuntu as well as mint xfce.  Lots to like (speed), but I always end up going back to stock ubuntu
[01:10] <Rage1> it doesn't really mention anything about configuration problems
[01:10] <mega1> brizilubuntu: you have to be very carfull make sure you know where you are installing to and windows 7 may replace the mbr of you internal hd and you may have to repair it when you are finshed but you have to boot into the cd to install windows 7
[01:13] <brizilubuntu> is their any link explaining abt installation of windows onto external drive please can u give the step sothat it may be easy..

[01:14] <Rage1> can someone at all help with an error in my canon ip2600 printer?
[01:15] <zg> I run realvnc on my server and was wondering if it's possible to keep it running while I am logged out of the machine
[01:15] <MarcN> Any pointers on debugging the IDE on WinXP/7/8? The serial/usb driver is not installing.  I'm helping FIRST Robotics kids and *none* of the kids' laptops properly load the driver provided with the 1.0.3 windows kit.
[01:16] <mega1> brizilubuntu: its not that hard once you boot into the cd there is a big buttion called install now click it next pick hd after that it will be installed
[01:16] <dr_willis> zg:  thats how vnc normally works for me.
[01:16] <MarcN> IDE 1.0.1 works great on *my* Ubuntu laptop, but the student's aren't up for that...
[01:16] <dr_willis> zg:  i ssh in, start a vncserver with a remote/hidden desktop. it stays  in the bacckground if i  disconnect/reconnect the vnc client
[01:17] <brizilubuntu> mega1: thanks i will try ;-)
[01:17] <MarcN> oops! Wrong window.  Sorry...
[01:17] <zg> you ssh in, but I don't want to enable that capability ;)
[01:18] <dr_willis> zg:   the question is do you want to see the CURRENT visible  desktop. or have a hidden desktop session
[01:18] <mega1> does anyone know why when i putty into my server and type exit it does not close the putty window
[01:18] <dr_willis> You can spawn a vnc session from rc.local at boot time and it will stay running untill you close it
[01:18] <brizilubuntu> I have on more problem i recently brought a Epson XP 405 printer and i install the drivers but in does't detect it can any one help me with it?
[01:19] <robman> heya - anyone have any tips on how to get tproxy enabled on 12.04LTS
[01:19] <zg> dr_willis: I downloaded the proprietary software from realvnc.com, so i'm not sure
[01:19] <dr_willis> mega1:  first guess.. its a putty setting to close window on disconnect
[01:19] <dr_willis> zg:  theres no need to get realvnc from them. theres dozens of vncservers in the repos
[01:19] <dr_willis> !info tightvnc
[01:19] <mega1> it closes when i connect to my frends server
[01:19] <ubottu> Package tightvnc does not exist in quantal
[01:19] <dr_willis> !find tightvnc
[01:19] <zg> dr_willis: I prefer realvnc
[01:19] <ubottu> Found: tightvncserver, xtightvncviewer, tightvnc-java
[01:20] <dr_willis> then i guess you  should read the realvnc docs.. all the vnc servers work about the same
[01:20] <compdoc> I like vnc4server - also in the repos
[01:20] <zg> theirs doesn't work the same
[01:20] <dr_willis> then you should definatly be reading their docs
[01:20] <zg> their latest version doesn't work with other clients trying to connect -- you need their client :/
[01:20] <dr_willis> sounds liek a good reason to NOT use realvnc then
[01:21] <kunji> I'll second that
[01:21] <zg> http://vnc.com/products/vnc/
[01:21] <brizilubuntu> I recently brought a Epson XP 405 printer and tried printing it can any one help me with it?
[01:22] <dr_willis> the thing people comming from windows have a hard time understanding is that vnc can have  several 'hidden' desktops running in the background that you only see via a vnc client. which is differnt from shareing the current visible desktop.
[01:22] <dr_willis> in windows vnc can only share the current desktop (last i looked)
[01:22] <zg> is this related to the "tty" numbers that I see in the `who'
[01:22] <dr_willis> in linux, it can do it either way

[01:23] <mega1> dr_willis: it will close when i connect to my frieds server
[01:23] <dr_willis> mega1:  if you set up vnc right. it will stay in the background.
[01:23] <dr_willis> if you set it up a differnt way it spawns on connection, then closes on disconnect
[01:23] <Alward> ‏​ألْـًُِ✆ـًُِ(☎)ـًُِ✆ـُُِوِْوِْوِْوِْ
[01:24] <zg> my vnc is setup to start when logged in
[01:24] <dr_willis> thats why it closes on exit then.
[01:24] <zg> it "spawns" on login, and goes away on disconnect
[01:24] <zg> on logout*
[01:24] <zg> spawns at login, "despawns" on logout
[01:25] <zg> I've always had issues setting up alternatives
[01:25] <dr_willis> i can start a tightvnc session with openbox. and leave it rinning in the background, i can then logoiut  and then connect to the vnc session from any vnc client. the desktop stays running
[01:25] <zg> finding clients that are cross-platform, etc..
[01:25] <zg> when I found realvnc, everything worked, I didn't have any issues
[01:25] <dr_willis> most vnc clients/servers are cross platform..   except aparently realvnc
[01:25] <dr_willis> i use tightvnc with vnc4server,  with tigervnc. with.. i cant think of the others.
[01:25] <dr_willis> several vnc clients on my phone'
[01:26] <zg> i'm gonna look into vnc now
[01:26] <zg> on ubuntu store
[01:26] <dr_willis> freenx is better then vnc in many ways
[01:26] <dr_willis> store? its in the default repos. :) no need to buy anything in the store.
[01:26] <zg> I just installed one called X11VNC Server
[01:26] <dr_willis> x11vnc shares the CURRENT desktop.
[01:27] <zg> err, Software center, my mistake
[01:27] <dr_willis> it works the same as VINO does in gnome.
[01:27] <zg> so, if I want to remotely control my ubuntu desktop (at home) from anywhere, what would your recommendation be
[01:27] <dr_willis> so to use it you have to login locally first and never logout locally
[01:27] <dr_willis> vnc across the  internat would require ssh tunnles also. so not  the  best way to do it
[01:28] <dr_willis> across the internet.. i just ssh. I  dont use a desktop/or vnc.
[01:28] <zg> I also want to be able to reboot remotely and be able to still remotely control
[01:28] <dr_willis> 3g/4g can be real laggy when doing it from the internet on my phone i find.
[01:29] <zg> hm, I might as well just setup ssh
[01:29] <zg> err, you know, get a better password setup,  a different port, etc etc.
[01:29] <dr_willis> ssh is the sort of thing you should DEFINATLY have if you want to remote into your pc
[01:29] <zg> yeah
[01:29] <zg> I should setup private/public keys instead of passwords
[01:29] <dr_willis> yep. i do that normally but it can be a pain
[01:30] <dr_willis> like i try a new ssh client.. got to figure out how to import the keys first..
[01:30] <zg> putty all the way :D
[01:30] <zg> (if windows)
[01:30] <dr_willis> windows? who uses that any more
[01:30] <zg> since yesterday? not me
[01:30] <dr_willis> Im on my android phone right now
[01:31] <dr_willis> i irc into my znc zerver on my raspberry pi linux box. ;)  then get here via znc
[01:31] <dr_willis> i can ssh into my pcs if i wanted to also.. but rarely  need to these days.
[01:33] <dr_willis> and putty has some really annoying 'quirks' ;)
[01:33] <dr_willis> but its the windows mindset.. its what everyone uses and has used.. so no  one wants to try to  change/find somthing better
[01:34] <zg> znc is the most epic software evar
[01:34] <dr_willis> putty + xming is handy if you got a ubuntu box on the lan (or linux box)
[01:34] <dr_willis> you can ssh x forward to the windows box and see gui apps on windows then.

[02:06] <KI4RO> I have a Canon PIXMA 280 plugged into a USB port on my wife's UBUNTU machine that works fine from her machine.  Now I am trying to access it from my machine with address 192.168.0.100:9100 but I don't seem able to print to it.  Any ideas?
[02:06] <zg> does ubuntu detect windows installations automatically
[02:06] <dr_willis> zg:  normally yes
=== |_ocke3 is now known as |_ocke
[02:06] <Dougie187> In gnome classic, how do you change the modified button for move window?
[02:06] <dr_willis> KI4RO:  use the cups web interface on her machine. make sure the thing is setup to share the printer/server to the network perhaps.
[02:06] <Dougie187> Like, changing alt to super
[02:07] <KI4RO> dr_willis, CUPS web interface?
[02:07] <undertaker> i'm hav[ing issues burning an iso to a disc
[02:07] <dr_willis> Dougie187:  you mean  the alt-click anywhere to move a window feature?
[02:07] <undertaker> incredibly aggravating
[02:07] <dr_willis> KI4RO:  yes.  the cups server  has a web interface on http:// localhost:631
[02:07] <bentinata> dr_willis, if I format the disk with wubi
[02:08] <magiK_> I've been using the Xubuntu desktop instead of Unity and I haven't gotten any crashes yet so I think I'm going to be sticking with this for awhile.
[02:08] <bentinata> dr_willis, is my system still ntfs?
[02:08] <eduardo> join #ubuntubr
[02:08] <bekks> bentinata: You do not format any disks using wubi :)
[02:08] <Dougie187> dr_willis: yeah. I want to change it from alt to super.
[02:08] <KI4RO> dr_willis, I'll have a look
[02:08] <dr_willis> bentinata:   wubi installs ubuntu to a file on the windows drive.. not sure what you  formated..
[02:08] <66MAAHTUC> Hello all! Can anyone recommend a good how to, tutorial on how to setup sshJails on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or higher?
[02:08] <Dougie187> dr_willis: but in gnome classic. not unity.
[02:08] <dr_willis> Dougie187:  the alt-click thing is a feature of X> its the same reguardles sof window manager/desktop i  belive
[02:09] <undertaker> can anyone help with an .iso burning issue?
[02:09] <bentinata> I booted with an USB stick, it's wubi right?
[02:09] <Dougie187> dr_willis: well, in unity I can change it with ccsm, under the "Move windows" section. But I'm not sure how to change it in no effects gnome classic, when it doesn't have compiz running
[02:09] <bentinata> or wubi is just installation on windows?
[02:09] <magiK_> bentinata, no wubi is ran from inside windows
[02:09] <eduardo> eii
[02:09] <eduardo>  gente
[02:09] <magiK_> bentinata, do not use wubi it is very slow
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[02:10] <dr_willis> well wubi installs from insode windows.. but you boot the wubi install and are not RUNNING wubi inside windows.
[02:10] <bentinata> thanks dr_willis, magiK_, bekks
[02:10] <dr_willis> its just ON a windows partition/filesytem
[02:10] <magiK_> dr_willis, Even so wubi is significantly slower
[02:10] <magiK_> dr_willis, and you will need to defragment your harddrive often.
[02:10] <dr_willis> it will be slower.. never seen any benchmarks
[02:11] <magiK_> dr_willis, I use to run ubuntu through wubi and it fragmented my hd so fast it's not even funny
[02:11] <dr_willis> that dosent make sence - the ubuntu hd file is a single huge file made at install...
[02:11] <dr_willis> so i cant imagine  why it would fragment the windows install over time.
[02:11] <magiK_> dr_willis, so I switched to a full install. more speed and don't have to worry about fragmentation issues because you have the full ext4 filesystem.
[02:12] <dr_willis> i dont use wubi. so i dont worry about wubi
[02:12] <bentinata> why people use wubi? basic installation isn't so difficult
[02:12] <undertaker> can anyone help with an .iso burning issue?
[02:12] <dr_willis> i keep waiting for wubi to get removed from the  disks
[02:12] <magiK_> dr_willis, ;) yeah wubi is cool just for someone to try out and see if they will like ubuntu
[02:13] <dr_willis> undertaker:  clarify the issue.
[02:13] <undertaker> well, i'm trying to mount this ubuntu studio .iso to a disc
[02:13] <djxvillain> Can someone please help me with this error:  "Failed to start the X server (your graphical interface).  It is likely that it is not set up correctly.  Please, please, please help me.  It's on my wife's laptop and she has a lot of data on there that we can't afford to lose.  Please help.
[02:13] <Pacman_> Hey When i do Apt-get update i got Static ip set but got these errors http://pastie.org/private/3r6x6badmz377saqjjvvra
[02:13] <undertaker> acetone iso can't find my disk drive
[02:13] <dr_willis> undertaker:  you mean mount the iso to a directory?
[02:13] <undertaker> the mounter that comes with ubuntu won't even open
[02:14] <undertaker> i... have no clue
[02:14] <undertaker> i just want to get ubuntu studio and it told me to mount it to a disc
[02:14] <dr_willis> undertaker:  you BURN to an actual disk/optical drive.. you MOUNT to a directory
[02:14] <Dougie187> dr_willis: I got it. I had to use dconf-editor. Just in case you were curious. Thanks. :D
[02:14] <dr_willis> I dont see how mounting the iso will acomplish much.. whats your end goal?
[02:14] <dr_willis> Dougie187:  i dont even rember the original problem
[02:14] <Pacman_> Can someone please help Me
[02:14] <Pacman_> w?
[02:15] <bentinata> Pacman_, your issue?
[02:15] <Pacman_>  When i do Apt-get update i got Static ip set but got these errors http://pastie.org/private/3r6x6badmz377saqjjvvra
[02:15] <Pacman_> think some is wrong with my dns
[02:15] <undertaker> then i have no clue how to install ubuntu studio then...
[02:15] <dr_willis> undertaker:  you burn it to a cd/dvd or put it on a USB then boot it and use the installer.
[02:15] <dr_willis> is the normal way
[02:16] <undertaker> i burned it once when it worked but it only basically copied the iso file to a disc
[02:16] <undertaker> there was no installer on the disc, just an iso
[02:16] <dr_willis> you dont just drag/drop/copy the iso  to a disk
[02:16] <dr_willis> you BURN/IMAGE the iso to the disk
[02:16] <bentinata> Pacman_, try change your mirror
[02:16] <dr_willis> !burn
[02:16] <ubottu> CD/DVD burning software: k3b (KDE), brasero (GNOME), gnomebaker, xcdroast, wodim (command-line) | To burn ISO files, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
[02:16] <undertaker> that's my problem though, no program is letting me
[02:17] <dr_willis> theres iso image burning tools for windows..
[02:17] <dr_willis> infrarecorder is one.
[02:17] <dr_willis> most likely a dozen others.
[02:17] <bentinata> UNetBootIn
[02:17] <undertaker> brasero isn't, acetone isn't, not even the ubuntu default will
[02:17] <dr_willis> unetbootin puts the iso on a flash drive.. not burn to dvd
[02:17] <undertaker> that one wont even open
[02:17] <Pacman_> bentinata>  How do i do that?
[02:17] <undertaker> i need to figure out why three separate programs refuse to mount ths thing
[02:17] <Pacman_> Using Ubuntu server 12.04 LTS
[02:18] <dr_willis> undertaker:  so you are on Ubuntu now? and want to  install ubuntu-studio on top of ubuntu? or remove ubuntui and replacce it with ubuntu-studio?
[02:18] <bentinata> Pacman_, in terminal, type "software-properties-gkt"
[02:18] <dr_willis> !iso
[02:18] <ubottu> To mount an ISO disc image, type « sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint> » - There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before !burning.
[02:18] <undertaker> i just want to install ubuntu studio, that's all
[02:18] <dr_willis> if you really want to MOUNT it.. you cando it via the command line
[02:18] <bentinata> Pacman_, "software-properties-gtk", sorry
[02:18] <dr_willis> !info ubuntu-studio
[02:18] <Tabis> boon question: ok, so ubuntu uses grub2 - fine, but how can i install grub legacy to an external drive now?
[02:18] <ubottu> Package ubuntu-studio does not exist in quantal
=== bakis is now known as Guest19888
[02:18] <undertaker> i can try that, what do i put in place of mount point?
[02:18] <dr_willis> sudo mkdir Ustudio
[02:18] <Pacman_> need to install it...
[02:19] <RollinV2> undertaker: on windows use imgburn to make the install dvd
[02:19] <dr_willis> sudo mount -o loop ubuntustudio.iso Ustudio
[02:19] <undertaker> i don't have windows
[02:19] <Pacman_> <bentinata> need to install that program
[02:19] <dr_willis> will MOUNT the iso to the directory Ustudio
[02:19] <undertaker> dr_willis: the filename I have is ubuntustudio-12.04.1-dvd-amd64.iso
[02:19] <bentinata> dr_willis, how to change mirror for software sources?
[02:19] <nearst> hi peepl
[02:19] <dr_willis> undertaker:  so use the example and use the name you  have
[02:20] <bentinata> Pacman_, do you have software-center?
[02:20] <undertaker> and put ustudio in the place of mountpoint?
[02:20] <dr_willis> You make the mountpoing any directory name you want that exists
[02:20] <undertaker> i don't know what that is though
[02:20] <dr_willis> MAKE a directory
[02:20] <dr_willis> any directory
[02:20] <undertaker> just any?
[02:21] <dr_willis> mkdir Iwanttoputitherre
[02:21] <undertaker> so just make a file anywhere
[02:21] <dr_willis> then use that name as the mountpoint
[02:21] <dr_willis> its a DIRECTORY
[02:21] <dr_willis> !mount
[02:21] <ubottu> mount is used to attach devices to directories. See also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount
[02:21] <undertaker> yes
[02:21] <undertaker> i know but i think it's clear i don't even know how to make a directory
[02:21] <dr_willis> sudo mkdir Ustudio
[02:21] <dr_willis> i said how earlier
[02:21] <undertaker> sadly
[02:21] <dr_willis> ;)
[02:22] <dr_willis> actually no need for sudo in that.
[02:22] <dr_willis> sudo mount -o loop ubuntustudio.iso Ustudio
[02:22] <undertaker> i did the mkdir thing and it did nothing
[02:22] <dr_willis> did you look and see if it made a directory?
[02:23] <undertaker> no clue how to find it
[02:23] <undertaker> but when i put in the command all it did was make a new line
[02:23] <dr_willis> use the file manager and lookl.. or try 'ls'
[02:23] <dr_willis> no error message = it worked
=== Guest19888 is now known as bakis
[02:23] <undertaker> lookl?
[02:23] <dr_willis> having commands print out large 'yes we worked perfectly' messages would benn annoying
[02:24] <dr_willis> use the ls command and look at your files.. or use the file manager to look at your directory
[02:24] <undertaker> ok, it worked
[02:24] <dr_willis> it may be time to  read a few bash beginner guides.
[02:24] <servvs> I have a built in intel 6150 wireless N wimax card in my laptop
[02:25] <undertaker> i've asked in here for a few before but no avail
[02:25] <servvs> however I am not showing a device for the wimax, only wlan0 and my lan adapter
[02:25] <undertaker> the ones i find online myself are vague to my eyes
[02:25] <dr_willis> theres 100000's of bash tutorials on the internet
[02:25] <Pacman_> <bentinata> all i have is normal server install + ssh
[02:25] <undertaker> great
[02:25] <dr_willis> see whch has the  most hits/tags/votes on delicious.com  ;)
[02:25] <undertaker> but i just said the ones i've seen so far are vague, so do you have any suggestions?
[02:26] <undertaker> think backk to when you were a noob at this
[02:26] <Tabis> next try: how can i setup grub-legay to an external drive without the ubuntu preinstalled grub2?
[02:26] <dr_willis> that was 25 yrs ago undertaker  the internet dident exist then
[02:26] <dr_willis> :)
[02:26] <undertaker> christ
[02:26] <undertaker> thanks anyway
[02:26] <dr_willis> 25+ yrs.. im old
[02:26] <Tex_Nick> undertaker : youTube has a lot of good beginning vids for bash
[02:27] <dr_willis> or see who tags the most on delicious.com
[02:27] <dr_willis> Oreially's Using Bash book - is a must read also
[02:27] <siggij72_> yeah try searching for advanced shell scripting, there's a good one from vtc on utube
[02:27] <undertaker> when i did the iso command you gave me it said no such file
[02:27] <undertaker> which is bs because i directly copied the name of the file
[02:28] <dr_willis> undertaker:  use the correct name. with proper case. use tab completion to make sure its correct
[02:28] <dr_willis> or its in a differnt directory
[02:28] <dr_willis> from where you are at now
[02:28] <undertaker> i did, i shift-ins the thing in there
[02:28] <codezombie> anyone here familair with grub and the ubuntu server install process? I'm trying to write a grub.cfg file to boot an ubuntu iso from usb.
[02:28] <undertaker> it's in my downloads folder
[02:28] <servvs> any idea how to get wimax to work on ubuntu 12.10?
[02:29] <codezombie> I seem to be running into issues with the cd rom detection process since I don't have a cd rom
[02:29] <dr_willis> undertaker:  so is your shell IN the Downloads directory?
[02:29] <dr_willis> cd Downloads
[02:29] <undertaker> which shell?
[02:29] <dr_willis> the one you are typing commands  in
[02:29] <dr_willis> you either work on files in the current directory. or you give a full path to the files.
=== merlin_ is now known as akakcolin
[02:30] <dr_willis> I would guess your  shell is currently cd'd to your HOME. while the iso is in /home/yourusername/Downloads
[02:30]  * akakcolin 
[02:30] <undertaker> i can't even tell, the iso went straight to my downloads folder when it fnished downloading
[02:30] <dr_willis> the shells prompt shows its current directoryu or use the 'pwd' command
[02:30] <undertaker> it's home/home/downloads
[02:31] <dr_willis>  Your users name is  home?
[02:31] <psusi> codezombie, why don't you just use the usb startup disk creator?
[02:31] <codezombie> psusi: efi
[02:31] <psusi> codezombie, and?
[02:31] <undertaker> no it's schlonginator
[02:32] <dr_willis> undertaker:  so your full path to your Downloads directory would be /home/sliongwhatever/Downloads
[02:32] <codezombie> psusi: I also don't have an existing installation to use the creator.
[02:32] <psusi> codezombie, what are you using then?  windows?  unetbootbin should work
[02:33] <codezombie> psusi: I'm installing on a mac mini.
[02:33] <undertaker> it says home home downloads at the top for me
[02:33] <RollinV2> undertaker: cd ~ && cd Downloads
[02:33] <undertaker> when i click the icon with the house that says schlonginator it doesn't open anything
[02:33] <psusi> codezombie, you can just dd the image to the usb then and it should boot
[02:33] <dr_willis> use the shell.. its easier for support
[02:33] <codezombie> psusi: it in fact does not work.
[02:33] <crittek> Hello
[02:33] <undertaker> is it always this hard just to mount an image?
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[02:34] <dr_willis> if you knew the basics of bash - its trivial
[02:34] <codezombie> psusi: I've attempted this a few times. Having to use a grub binary to boot the iso directly.
[02:34] <RollinV2> hard is a relative term
[02:34] <dr_willis> cd  ~/Downloads
[02:34] <dr_willis> mkdir ISODIR
[02:34] <codezombie> I get an error during the installation that states the cd rom (which there is none) is not able to be used for installation.
[02:34] <dr_willis> sudo mount -o loop ISONAME.iso  ISODIR
[02:34] <dr_willis> done....
[02:34] <undertaker> ok it says no such file or directory when i do the iso command you gave
[02:34] <undertaker> but the file is there
[02:34] <undertaker> that's what's bugging me
[02:34] <codezombie> psusi: which leads me to beleive I'm missing a critical boot flag.
[02:35] <dr_willis> and we are back to wheres your SHELL is cd'd to...
[02:35] <dr_willis> so what does 'pwd' say
[02:35] <undertaker> i have NO clue
[02:35] <dr_willis> pwd = print working diurectory
[02:35] <RollinV2> type 'pwd' in your terminal
[02:35] <servvs> where can I get wimax drivers for linux?
[02:35] <psusi> undertaker, the file is where?  does `ls` show it?
[02:35] <nearst> eww. wimax?
[02:35] <dr_willis> notice the 3 commands i gave earlier.. the first one cd's to the Downloads directory
[02:36] <M4d3L1> how do I check what is running on a specific port?
[02:36] <dr_willis> the bash proompt also shows the current directory
[02:36] <undertaker> pwd says home/schlonginator/
[02:36] <undertaker> that's it
[02:36] <dr_willis> undertaker:  so you are NOT in the Downloads directory
[02:36] <EatAtJoes> I would like to install Windows7 in a virtual machine inside my ubuntu. I have to buy windows to do this, should I buy the Windows 7 System Builder version?
[02:36] <undertaker> damn it
[02:36] <dr_willis> so give the Full path to the ISO. or cd to Downloads
[02:36] <c00kee> explain to me what samba is good for
[02:37] <dr_willis> then use the commands
[02:37] <RollinV2> cd to downloads seems safer for him
[02:37] <psusi> c00kee, sharing files over the network
[02:37] <undertaker> this is the full path /home/schlonginator/Downloads
[02:37] <dfafasdfasfd> ur doing it wrong u run k26 in w7 vm
[02:37] <dr_willis> undertaker:  now use the 'ls' command to see what files are there.
[02:37] <dr_willis> you  should see your  ISO file now
[02:38] <thec4ke> c00kee, specifically to and from windows systems
[02:38] <undertaker> all ls did was list my directories again
[02:38] <crittek> USB 802.11 adapters . . .  . supported?
[02:38] <dr_willis> you dont see your ISO file?
[02:38] <dr_willis> cd Downloads
[02:38] <dr_willis> ls
[02:38] <undertaker> where, file manager or terminal?
[02:39] <undertaker> you told me to type ls and i did
[02:39] <dr_willis> use the terminakl...
[02:39] <psusi> thec4ke, it's actually kind of good for sharing between linux systems too... NFS is kinda shite
[02:39] <dr_willis> not the filemanager
[02:39] <dr_willis> cd ~/Downloads
[02:39] <dr_willis> ls
[02:39] <TheLordOfTime> crittek, you mean 802.11 wifi adapters?
[02:39] <c00kee> how about from linux to windows systems
[02:39] <dr_willis>  should show your  iso file
[02:39] <undertaker> well right now in the terminal i have nothing
[02:39] <TheLordOfTime> crittek, like a wifi dongle or something?
[02:39] <thec4ke> yea agreed
[02:39] <dfafasdfasfd> so who can help me with a packet
[02:39] <crittek> yes
[02:39] <servvs> so am I really not going to get any help with this wimax in ubuntu?
[02:39] <undertaker> that command said no such exists
[02:39] <dr_willis> which command? what did you type EXACTLY
[02:40] <RollinV2> dr_willis: it might be easier to pastbin him a list of commands to follow at this rate
[02:40] <TheLordOfTime> crittek, depends on the adapter.

[02:40] <dr_willis> boss is hollering at me.. i gotta run. back in about an hr.
[02:40] <undertaker> ok i got it
[02:40] <TheLordOfTime> crittek, if i may give you a suggestion, upgrade to 12.04 or later, 11.10'll be EOL in april.
[02:40] <undertaker> the iso isn't in there at all
[02:41] <RollinV2> undertaker: you need to learn your bash commands for cd, ls, and mount
[02:41] <psusi> undertaker, then you have to figure out where the heck it is
[02:41] <crittek> had trouble with iso file on old equip. . . . plan to upgrade
[02:41] <TheLordOfTime> crittek, as for which ones're supported, i don't know offhand, someone else might be able to help you with that, so have some patience while you wait for someone :)
[02:41] <undertaker> i know where it is! in my downloads folder
[02:41] <undertaker> i've been saying that this whole time
[02:41] <crittek> thanx
[02:41] <psusi> undertaker, you just said it insn't
[02:41] <RollinV2> undertaker: no you dont know where it is
[02:41] <memand> I have a teminal set up as a transparent bacgground, but it kind of loses its point if it also disapears when I "show desktop"
[02:41] <undertaker> when i go to my downloads folder, it's right there
[02:42] <undertaker> that's where it went when it finished downloading
[02:42] <psusi> undertaker, then typing ls ~/Downloads in a terminal should show it
[02:42] <dfafasdfasfd> where is !noobhelp channel
[02:42] <undertaker> this is ridiculous
[02:42] <undertaker> not you guys
[02:43] <memand> dfafasdfasfd: What seems to be the problem?
[02:43] <undertaker> this entire thing
[02:43] <thec4ke> undertaker, type this:  find / -name "*.iso"

[02:43] <thec4ke> it might take a while
[02:43] <dfafasdfasfd> memand i need help with a packet
[02:43] <undertaker> it brings up every file in downloads BUT my ido
[02:43] <RollinV2> he might not have locate installed

[02:44] <undertaker> k so the iso is in downloads
[02:45] <undertaker> !iso
[02:45] <ubottu> To mount an ISO disc image, type « sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint> » - There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before !burning.
[02:45] <psusi> dfafasdfasfd, what the heck are you talking about?

[02:49] <escott> undertaker, paste.ubuntu.com your terminal session
[02:50] <newbie|3> hello!
[02:50] <RollinV2> escott: wow, excellent suggestion.
[02:50] <undertaker> one sec
[02:50] <Egon> newbie|3: howdy
[02:50] <cfhowlett> newbie|3, greetings
[02:51] <Haematoma> Hi, is anyone here familiar with rtorrent configuration?
[02:51] <undertaker> escott: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1518884/
[02:51] <escott> RollinV2, can't tell if that was serious or sarcastic
[02:51] <bazhang> Haematoma, whats the exact issue
[02:51] <RollinV2> escott: serious.
[02:52] <RollinV2> escott: though a joke about how many nerds it takes to cd into a downloads directory could be made right now.. haha
[02:52] <escott> undertaker, thats not enough to say. you are in ~ the file ubuntustudio-12.04.1-dvd-amd64.iso is not in ~
[02:52] <Haematoma> I have two watch folders, labeled watch1 and watch2.
[02:52] <Haematoma> I want downloads in progress for watch1 to go in progress1, when they are completed I want them to go into completed1
[02:52] <escott> undertaker, if that file is in ~/Downloads you need to "cd Downloads" first or "sudo mount -o loop ~/Downloads/ubuntustudio..."
[02:52] <Haematoma> for watch 2, I want downloads in progress to go into folder progress 2, and for completed downloads completed 2
[02:52] <undertaker> my fundamental issue this entire time has been that error
[02:53] <bazhang> Haematoma, on a single line, thats impossible to read
[02:53] <Haematoma> bazhang:  sorry, I will try again.
[02:53] <undertaker> and that's where i get lost
[02:54] <Haematoma> bazhang: I want rtorrent to move completed downloads into different folders depending on the watch folder
[02:54] <undertaker> i did the cd downloads command before this and nothing was solved
[02:54] <thec4ke> undertaker, do you understand what cd does?
[02:55] <RollinV2> man cd
[02:55] <escott> RollinV2, no man entry. its a builtin
[02:55] <undertaker> very vaguely
[02:55] <cfhowlett> info cd
[02:55] <thec4ke> your shell is like a folder
[02:55] <thec4ke> youre always "in a  directory"
[02:55] <thec4ke> cd changes the directory youre in
[02:55] <psusi> undertaker, how are you lost... you are being given the exact commands to type, yet you apparently keep refusing to type the first one
[02:55] <RollinV2> escott: really? ive never .... ah wow. learned something new today
[02:55] <thec4ke> see at the end of your prompt
[02:55] <thec4ke> you have the little ~
[02:56] <undertaker> dude I've been typing every single command given
[02:56] <thec4ke> that means youre currently in your home directory
[02:56] <thec4ke> its an alias for home
[02:56] <undertaker> refusing?
[02:56] <escott> undertaker, if you "cd Downloads" your prompt should become schlonginator@schlong:/home/schlonginator/Downloads$ and "ls" should list the ubuntustudio iso file
[02:56] <thec4ke> you need to do cd Downloads
[02:56] <psusi> undertaker, you have not been typing the "cd Downloads" command
[02:56] <cfhowlett> undertaker, help cd will give you the program commands
[02:56] <undertaker> haha ok, let me show you what happened when I typed cd downloads then
[02:56] <thec4ke> that means change directory to tDownloads
[02:56] <undertaker> since I didn't do it three times or anything
[02:57] <RollinV2> ubuntu is also case sensitive, downloads != Downloads
[02:57] <undertaker> schlonginator@schlong:~$ cd downloads bash: cd: downloads: No such file or directory
[02:57] <thec4ke> its case sensitive..
[02:57] <psusi> undertaker, it's a capital D
[02:57] <escott> undertaker, cAse SENsiTIVE
[02:57] <RollinV2> called it. lol
[02:57] <undertaker> i remember doing it with a capital too, and it gave this schlonginator@schlong:~/Downloads$
[02:57] <thec4ke> that is what you want
[02:57] <undertaker> this was like 20 min ago
[02:57] <thec4ke> but
[02:58] <escott> undertaker, then does the iso appear if you type "ls"
[02:58] <thec4ke> you somehow are no longer ther
[02:58] <RollinV2> you had it undertaker
[02:58] <undertaker> did that too, and yes it does
[02:58] <Haematoma> bazhang: nvm, i think i figured it out. thanks anyhow
[02:58] <thec4ke> the mount command should work now
[02:58] <thec4ke> because youre in the  right directory to use it
[02:59] <undertaker> this is exactly what I have http://paste.ubuntu.com/1518892/
[02:59] <undertaker> line 19 has the iso I'm trying to install
[02:59] <thec4ke> now do the mount command
[02:59] <thec4ke> the one that failed earlier
[03:00] <matrixfox> undertaker: cd ~/Downloads
[03:00] <psusi> undertaker, now mount it
[03:00] <escott> undertaker, then "sudo mount -o loop ubuntustudio-12.04.1-dvd-amd64.iso ~/poop should work if there is a "poop" directory in ~
[03:00] <psusi> undertaker, you did create the "poop" directory right?
[03:01] <undertaker> yes
[03:01] <RollinV2> escott: i really wish we could make that the room topic for today
[03:01] <skp1> haha
[03:01] <memand> lol
[03:01] <undertaker> escott: this is what i got mount: warning: /home/schlonginator/poop seems to be mounted read-only.
[03:01] <matrixfox> that's fine...
[03:02] <escott> undertaker, sounds like you have already successfully mounted the loopback at some point in the past
[03:02] <psusi> undertaker, then mount it now.. and note that tab completion works in the shell so you don't have to type the full file name, just the first few letters, then hitting tab should fill in the rest
[03:02] <escott> undertaker, "mount | grep poop" what does that output
[03:02] <psusi> undertaker, the iso9660 filesystem ms read only by definition
[03:02] <psusi> s/ms/is
[03:03] <undertaker> escott: /home/schlonginator/Downloads/ubuntustudio-12.04.1-dvd-amd64.iso on /home/schlonginator/poop type iso9660 (ro)
[03:03] <escott> RollinV2, gotta love the 12 year old guys
[03:03] <escott> undertaker, its already mounted
[03:03] <undertaker> but not installed?
[03:03] <escott> !xy | undertaker
[03:03] <ubottu> undertaker: The XY problem is when you need to do X, and you think you can use Y to do X, so you ask about how to do Y, when what you really should do is state what your X problem is. There may be a Z solution that is even better than Y, but nobody can suggest it if X is never mentioned.
[03:03] <psusi> umm.. no... mounting != install
[03:04] <memand> what exactly is it that we are trying to do?
[03:05] <undertaker> i don't think that's totally accurate but whatever
[03:05] <RollinV2> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/Installation
[03:05] <psusi> undertaker, if you want to install ubuntu studio, then you need to either burn it to a cd, or use the usb startup disk creator to write it to a usb flash stick, then boot from it
[03:05] <undertaker> that was my inital problem!
[03:05] <thec4ke> :\
[03:05] <RollinV2> undertaker do you want to upgrade an existing ubuntu install to studio, or start fresh?
[03:05] <bazhang> is a lie
[03:05] <undertaker> i said that at the beginning, three programs won't burn this to a disc
[03:06] <RollinV2> undertaker: you can upgrade to studio
[03:06] <escott> undertaker, you clearly have a working linux system. how did you install that one?
[03:06] <undertaker> i said that, and i got led on this lovely rollercoaster of mounting
[03:06] <thec4ke> rofl
[03:06] <memand> undertaker: you wan't to install this ubuntu studio distro right?
[03:06] <RollinV2> </facepalm>
[03:06] <thec4ke> i think someome missunderstood you
[03:06] <thec4ke> mounting has nothing to do with this
=== charlie__ is now known as mailhauler
[03:07] <undertaker> [21:13] <undertaker> well, i'm trying to mount this ubuntu studio .iso to a disc
[03:07] <thec4ke> mount doesnt mean burn
[03:07] <psusi> undertaker, you don't 'mount to a disk'... you burn to a disk
[03:07] <thec4ke> thats where the confusion is
[03:07] <memand> undertaker: do you have a usb drive near by?
[03:07] <psusi> which are you trying to use, a flash drive, or a dvd?
[03:08] <RollinV2> undertaker: what operating system and version are you using right now?
[03:08] <undertaker> DVD
[03:08] <undertaker> Ubuntu 12.10
[03:08] <thec4ke> the live DVD?
[03:08] <undertaker> i ave a blank dvd
[03:08] <psusi> undertaker, then fire up brasero and burn the iso to the disc
[03:08] <RollinV2> undertaker: ok, you cant upgrade to studio.. you need to install it fresh
[03:08] <undertaker> thats one of the programs i said wasn't working an hour ago
[03:09] <dr_willis> RollinV2:  i was thinking that also..
[03:09] <undertaker> brasero and acetone can't find my disc drive
[03:09] <cfhowlett> undertaker, do you have vanilla ubuntu installed?  Because you CAN easily upgrade that to Ubuntustudio ...
[03:09] <psusi> define "don't work"
[03:09] <undertaker> cfhowlett: no
[03:09] <memand> remember to do it at the slowest bur speed posible (no kidding) so it has the smallest chance f'ing uo anything ;)
[03:09] <psusi> well if your drive isn't working then you've got a problem
[03:09] <thec4ke> undertaker, did you install ubuntu?
[03:09] <escott> undertaker, somehow somewhere someday you burned yourself an ubuntu cd because you *have* a working ubuntu system right? why not recreate that process but with the ubuntustudio iso
[03:09] <cfhowlett> undertaker, ok.  USB installation is not an option?
[03:09] <thec4ke> or are you just running it from the dvd
[03:09] <RollinV2> dr_willis: ya.. this is a rare time i'd like to see studio work on the *.10 releases
[03:10] <undertaker> let me send shots of what happens in acetone and brasero...
[03:10] <dr_willis> RollinV2:  ive rarely messed with Studio, never really clear on the differances. It does have  a custom kernel i thought
[03:10] <bazhang> undertaker, do you have a current ubuntu install
[03:10] <dr_willis> xcombust seems to work well for burining isos also
[03:10] <undertaker> 12.10
[03:10] <bazhang> undertaker, is that a yes
[03:11] <dr_willis> Im not even sure why people would need Ubuntu-studio instead of normal ubuntu ;))
[03:11] <thec4ke> real time kernel
[03:11] <thec4ke> better for rendering audio i and video in real time
[03:11] <undertaker> this is acetone: http://imagebin.org/242461
[03:11] <bazhang> undertaker, if you have ubuntu currently, then just install the ubuntustudio-desktop package
[03:11] <cfhowlett> dr_willis, some people like oysters, some people like clams ...
[03:11] <thec4ke> for things like sequencing and video editing
[03:11] <dr_willis> cfhowlett:  i perfer Steak!
[03:12] <dr_willis> ;)
[03:12] <bazhang> !info ubuntustudio-desktop | undertaker
[03:12] <ubottu> undertaker: ubuntustudio-desktop (source: ubuntustudio-meta): Ubuntu Studio Desktop Package. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.108 (quantal), package size 4 kB, installed size 39 kB
[03:12] <RollinV2> bazhang: i dont think he can? its not in 12.10 right?
[03:12] <chamunks> whats the default tracert tool included in ubuntu.
[03:12] <psusi> unless you are recording music you are creating with a synthesiser, there's no need for that
[03:12] <bazhang> RollinV2, see above
[03:12] <undertaker> http://imagebin.org/242462 brasero
[03:12] <RollinV2> ahhhh
[03:12] <bazhang> undertaker, please note what I just said
[03:12] <dr_willis> sudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop
[03:13] <dr_willis> will convert a ubuntu install into a ubuntu-studio install then. :)
[03:13] <bazhang> undertaker, there is Zero reason to burn another iso
[03:13] <dr_willis> it will install a LOT of extra stuff
[03:13] <undertaker> ubuntustudio-desktop package? is that in sw center?
[03:13] <skp1> i gotta pee, brb
[03:13] <bazhang> undertaker, YES
[03:13] <thec4ke> or if youre using av processors
[03:13] <dr_willis> undertaker:  the bot says it is.
[03:13] <undertaker> i was directed to do this iso stuff yesterday in the forums
[03:13] <cfhowlett> undertaker, I'm an ubuntustudio fan(atic).  If you don't need the full meal deal, why not install just vanilla ubuntu and the components you need rather than the full ubuntustudio?
[03:13] <thec4ke> which you undoubtedly are
[03:13] <psusi> that's weird.. a blank dvd holds 4.7g not 2.6
[03:14] <undertaker> that struck me as odd too
[03:14] <bazhang> undertaker, so install that package, select from login, and you have ubuntustudio
[03:14] <undertaker> there's no studio in the sw center
[03:14] <thec4ke> youll need to reboot the pc to load the new kernel as well
[03:15] <dr_willis> command should be ---->    sudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop
[03:15] <bazhang> undertaker, do it from the command line then. IT'S there
[03:15] <undertaker> guessing it's a terminal install
[03:15] <psusi> undertaker, have you burned this disc before?
[03:15] <RollinV2> undertaker: also read this when you get some time. bookmark it. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
[03:15] <dr_willis> or you are  the software center is hideing it under advanced type items
[03:15] <cfhowlett> undertaker, note that 12.10 is NOT recommended.  12.04, the LTS release is the recommended package.  Why?  Bleeding/cutting edge interim releases break.  LTS releases are a bit more stable.  For a working, production studio machine, you might want to factor that in ...
[03:15] <bazhang> psusi, he does not to burn a disk at all
[03:17] <psusi> only think I can think of is that this disc has been burned and then blanked maybe, which doesn't work with -R media since it can't be erased
[03:17] <undertaker> so i should install 12.04?
[03:17] <undertaker> (yes, i know i need to learn this shit)
[03:18] <dr_willis> is this for real work.. or for you playing around.. ;)
[03:18] <cfhowlett> undertaker, I'd suggest you consider it.
[03:18] <RollinV2> undertaker: i started with ubuntu studio years ago because i thought the wallpaper was pretty.. trust me.. you will learn and improve. dont be discouraged.
[03:18] <psusi> undertaker, make sure you are using a fresh disc
[03:18] <cfhowlett> undertaker, as rollinv2 stated, you WILL learn how these things work.
[03:19] <dr_willis> undertaker:  why do you specifically need ubuntu-studio anyway?
[03:19] <undertaker> video editing
[03:19] <undertaker> i have a channel
[03:20] <dr_willis> what kind of editing?
[03:20] <oitofelix> Hello.  I'm trying to play sound using SDL with NAS driver, but if I try it with mplayer or Audacious I get "Failed to open audio stream: No available audio device." NAS is working nice.  Only SDL over NAS driver has that issue.  Can anyone help?

=== edge is now known as Guest8803
[03:21] <Rajvi> Suggest something!
[03:21] <dr_willis> undertaker:  yes the normal ubuntu 12.10 desktop can do most video editing tasks fine. Ubuntu studio has a real time jernel and other tweaks for RECORDING  that make it better in some cases
[03:22] <pmp6nl> Hello,  I have a usb external hard drive.  Every so often while I am creating an encrypted file via truecrypt it will randomly unmount.  Any ideas?  Thanks
[03:22] <dr_willis> but i doubt if you will notice much of a differance
[03:22] <undertaker> i don't have any video editors on here though
[03:22] <cfhowlett> undertaker, openshot
[03:23] <dr_willis> you can install anything On ubuntu thats on ubuntu-studio. they use the same software sources
[03:23] <cfhowlett> undertaker, video editing ... openshot
[03:23] <undertaker> does that come preinstalled/
[03:23] <RollinV2> pmp6nl: is the drive usb or a/c powered? if usb it miht disconnect from lack of power
[03:23] <RollinV2> might*
[03:23] <cfhowlett> undertaker, no.  see software center and install
[03:23] <dr_willis> i think theres like 4  nonlinear video editors out now isent there? Openshot, kino, that one by the VLC guys?  and some other
[03:23] <escott> pmp6nl, check dmesg
[03:23] <pmp6nl> RollinV2, its usb3, no ac
[03:23] <undertaker> Rajvi: Do you have tweak tool?
[03:24] <dr_willis> My USB3 Hard disks have AC Power. ;)
[03:24] <cfhowlett> dr_willis, avidemux is the other well know VE
[03:24] <dr_willis> or the big ones do at least.
[03:24] <dr_willis> thats more of a converter isent it?  I rarely work with video

[03:25] <tompa> how do u oben and install a ".deb" file?
[03:25] <RollinV2> cloud storage ftw
[03:25] <dr_willis> tompa:  one way  sudo gdebi foo.deb
[03:25] <Rajvi> No, I know some, but don't know which one would be good?
[03:25] <psusi> tompa, you can install it with sudo dpkg -i foo.deb
[03:25] <dr_willis> tompa:  if you have gdebi instggalled.
[03:25] <cfhowlett> dr_willis, I've never used it.  Openshot is so intuitive, even an old hound like me can figure it out...
[03:25] <dr_willis> gdebi will pull in needed dependencies. so its handy
[03:26] <undertaker> Rajvi: where did you download the the theme from?
[03:26] <FatsDomino> brok was always good
[03:26] <tompa> dr_willis so it would be sudo gdeb foo.deb + what? how does the terminal know which file to choose?
[03:26] <pmp6nl> RollinV2, escott not sure if anything helpful is in dmesg, would you mind checking?  http://pastebin.com/eiNg9E0D
[03:26] <tompa> psusi
[03:26] <dr_willis> tompa:  thats it...  use the name of your deb
[03:26] <psusi> tompa, you tell it the file to choose?  hence the foo.deb argument

[03:30] <psusi> someone wanna show FatsDomino the door?  he's spamming/phishing/begging for money in private msgs
[03:30] <bazhang> psusi, whats up
[03:30] <RollinV2> gah, im 0 for 2 on remembering exact app names today
[03:30] <hexstatik> it there a way to improve the smoothness of 12.10 system wide? im getting some tearing and some stuttering...running on a 120hz monitor very noticeable
[03:31] <hexstatik> seems like there should be a way to turn up the rendered fps or something like that
[03:31] <Rajvi> Tweak tool is not in my repos, i guess :(
[03:31] <RollinV2> hexstatik: install 12.04, or install xfce, or install mate/cinnimon, or install gnome 3 if you live dangerous
[03:31] <hexstatik> RollinV2: 12.04 was smoother?
[03:32] <hexstatik> RollinV2: this is my frist ubuntu install in last 5 years
[03:32] <farfu> great! I will do the 12.04 and give it a try. THx
[03:32] <RollinV2> hexstatik: for me unity was much smoother in 12.04. it may vary for you of course
[03:32] <bazhang> RollinV2, recommend ing MINT ppa is not good advice at all.  unity and gnome-shell are all gnome3
[03:33] <Rajvi> Can i use MYunity would that would work
[03:33] <bazhang> Rajvi, what version of ubuntu are you on
[03:33] <RollinV2> bazhang: "if you live dangerous" implied that.
[03:33] <Rajvi> 12.10
[03:33] <njd001> re-hi i thnk i missed something earlier when you said i could adjust nano's colours you mentioned nanorc but there was somehting else you guys suggested i look at
[03:33] <bazhang> Rajvi, why not just change themes with system settings
=== Teufelchen_ is now known as Teufelchen
[03:34] <Rajvi> I m not able to do so :(
[03:34] <Rajvi> only shows default themes!
[03:34] <bazhang> Rajvi, give a link to the theme please
[03:34] <RollinV2> njd001: could be any of the dotfiles. .. .vimrc, .bashrc, etc
[03:35] <Rajvi> http://www.itworld.com/software/315365/install-ten-great-unity-and-gnome-shell-themes-ubuntu-1210
[03:35] <bazhang> Rajvi, which one or ones
[03:35] <Rajvi> all
[03:35] <bazhang> Rajvi, are you on gnome-shell or unity
[03:35] <Rajvi> Unity
[03:36] <Rajvi> Gimme a tool or something too apply these. I know where they are installed!
[03:36] <njd001> this Fusha color for comments section is *killing* me i practically have to cross my eyes to read it
[03:36] <pmp6nl> escott, i will give sudo hdparm -S 0 /dev/sdb5 a try
[03:37] <njd001> the .bashrc maybe ?
[03:37] <bazhang> Rajvi, they are not fully compatible with 12.04
[03:37] <Rajvi> Alright, guys.. I gave you guys enough headche with these
[03:37] <dr_willis> i think ubuntu-tweak (get it from its homepage) akso has some theme selection section
[03:38] <Rajvi> I will find out.
[03:38] <bazhang> Rajvi, it says so in the comments on that link
[03:38] <dr_willis> ive been using gnome-shell lately. ;)
[03:38] <njd001> looks like its .bashrc
[03:38] <dr_willis> it has its own tweaking tools.
[03:39] <njd001> thanks for that RollinV2 i was banging my head on a wall trying to figure out who would pick fusha for a background color
[03:40] <RollinV2> njd001: thats the beauty of linux. dont like it. change it :-)
[03:40] <njd001> yes i can't find it
=== jackson_ is now known as jackson
[03:40] <njd001> i dont think im spelling fusha right
[03:40] <njd001> maybe pink?
[03:41] <njd001> I am looking at TCL eggdrop scripts for stock quotes and i can't read the notes section :(
[03:41] <bazhang> fuchsia
[03:42] <bentinata> hahaha, ubuntu is cute with fuchsia
[03:43] <Mkop1> for some reason ubuntu is not recognizing my microphone. anyone have advice for how to troubleshoot?
[03:43]  * njd001 isnt finding a color blinding me 'cute'
[03:44] <escott> pmp6nl, doubt that will help its probably a usb issue
[03:44] <pmp6nl> escott, ya it didnt help.  No truecrypt is complaining of a disk error.  Do you know how to revert hdparm -S ?
[03:45] <hexstatik> it there a way to improve the smoothness of 12.10 system wide? im getting some tearing and some stuttering...running on a 120hz monitor very noticeable
[03:48] <dr_willis> you mean for video playback> or the desktop
[03:48] <hexstatik> desktop
[03:48] <hexstatik> for example if i take a window and drag it around
[03:48] <dr_willis> ccsm has some sync to vblank setting i recall
[03:48] <hexstatik> there is some 'ghosting'
[03:48] <hexstatik> lemme see
[03:49] <njd001> hmmmmmmm
[03:49] <njd001> this is bugging me nothing in the .bashrc
[03:49] <hexstatik> dr_willis: and i am on a 120hz monitor, its much smoother in windows
[03:50] <hexstatik> dr_willis: its almost as if the frames per second are capped at say 60 and not 120
[03:50] <dr_willis> could be your only at 60mhz rate also
[03:50] <hexstatik> in other words im not getting the maximum out of my 120hz monitor which costs 400 dollars
[03:50] <hexstatik> you mean my system or the monitor? the monitor is at 120hz
=== FatsDomino is now known as Tennis_Bagel_Tab
[03:50] <dr_willis> check the monitor settings tool
[03:50] <hexstatik> the monitor is at 120hz
[03:51] <hexstatik> i checked, and i can tell from my cursor
[03:51] <hexstatik> i have two monitors actually one 120hz one 60hz
[03:51] <hexstatik> so its easy to compare
[03:51] <dr_willis> you got better eyes then me  then..  ;)
[03:51] <dr_willis> I recall old amiga days with interlaced displays at like 15hz ;)
[03:51] <hexstatik> yea i remember playing doom
[03:52] <hexstatik> on a laptop in early 90s
[03:52] <hexstatik> it was a slideshow
[03:53] <keber> if you wanna be billionaire, you must go over 3 seas
[03:53] <krzkrz> anyone can recomment a terminal that stores sessions?
[03:53] <dr_willis> krzkrz:  clarify what you mean by that.
=== root_ is now known as aaron318
[03:54] <bazhang> keber, what?
[03:54] <hexstatik> krzkrz: quake stores your commands and you can view them with up arrow, i think regular terminal does too
[03:54] <njd001> RollinV2 any other ideas how to get rid of this Fusicha comment colors
[03:54] <krzkrz> dr_willis, youve used maxosx before?
[03:54] <hexstatik> keber: what if just millionare will do?
[03:54] <bazhang> keber, no more nonsense, stay on topic
[03:55] <thec4ke> krzkrz: gnu screen can save and resume sessions
[03:55] <krzkrz> dr_willis, im trying to create a window group
[03:55] <krzkrz> so when i open a terminal. other tabs with commands will execute
[03:56] <krzkrz> when i reboot, i dont need to manually open all these tabs and execute each command
=== Tennis_Bagel_Tab is now known as Bernard_Angus_St
[03:56] <dr_willis> not seen one that remembers
[03:57] <dr_willis> ssh would really confuse it i bet
[03:57] <krzkrz> dr_willis, what approach can i take?
[03:57] <tompa> how do you uninstall something you didnt install through ubuntu software center?
[03:58] <krzkrz> i dont want to have to manually open each tab and run each command after reboot
[03:59] <jake_> I need to remove  ubuntu as a dual boot for windows 8 and reinstall it. how do i do that?
[03:59] <bazhang> jake_, then just install over it
[03:59] <dr_willis> just reinstall and reformat
[04:00] <jake_> when you say reformat it what do you mean?
[04:00] <dr_willis> ubuntu installer can format the artitions
[04:00] <dr_willis> partitions
[04:01] <dr_willis> why are you reinstalling
[04:01] <jake_> ok. is it more beneficial to use windows installer or a disk to install it
[04:01] <jake_> because i used windows installer and its really slow compared to what i think it should be.
[04:01] <dr_willis> windows installer is wubi
[04:01] <jake_> yes i used wubi
[04:01] <dr_willis> not a normal install
[04:02] <jake_> but i feel using a usb or disk will be better. correct?
[04:02] <dr_willis> avoid wubi
[04:02] <dr_willis> faster. es
[04:02] <dr_willis> yes
[04:02] <hexstatik> dr_willis: in ccsm under composite i found refresh rate
[04:02] <bazhang> jake_, the installer will handle resizing etc
[04:02] <hexstatik> "rate at which screen is reddrawn", i am not familiar with the term reddrawn
[04:02] <jake_> will it automatically write over the last version of ubuntu?
[04:03] <dr_willis> hexstatik: general tab has a vsync setting i recall
[04:03] <hexstatik> vsync is off
[04:03] <hexstatik> but
[04:03] <hexstatik> and vsync is not the ussue
[04:03] <dr_willis> tell the installer what to do.. is best
[04:04] <hexstatik> i just tried 30 in refresh rate
[04:04] <dr_willis> jake_: the installer will not remove a wubi install
[04:04] <hexstatik> and it is indeed the fps
[04:04] <Aironet> hello all I am having trouble connecting my aironet CB21Ag-A-K9 wirless cardbus on a panasonic toughbook running Xubuntu 12.10. The drivers are there but is shows as eth0 is this correct?
[04:04] <bazhang> jake_, not with wubi, no. add/remove in windows to remove that wubi
[04:04] <jake_> how do i remove a wubi install?
[04:05] <jake_> oh alright cool. it still gives me an option to boot into ubuntu though?
[04:05] <tompa> how do i uninstall a program i didnt install from ubuntu software center?
[04:05] <Aironet> can anyone please help me?
[04:05] <bentinata> tompa, sudo apt-get remove "program name"
[04:06] <bentinata> tompa, and if you want to clear the remain file of that program, use --purge
[04:07] <njd001> figured it out
[04:07] <njd001> it was the tcl.nanorc file :D
[04:08] <ogist> Hello, I have a file /home/ogist/quake2/quake2 and I want to make a shortcut of it on the desktop. How do I go about this? :)
[04:08] <dr_willis> wubi is in the windows add/remove programs list
[04:09] <KsM> ln -s /home/ogist/quake2/quake2 ~/Desktop/Quake\ 2
[04:09] <Aironet> Hello I have a aironet wifi cardbus that wont be seen by Xubuntu does anyone have advice on how to connect it?
[04:09] <KsM> alternatively a .desktop file where you can specify an icon and stuff
[04:09] <dr_willis> make a script ogist that cd then runs the game  may work better
[04:09] <tompa> bentinata how do I know what the program is named? Seems that Oracles VM isnt named "virtualbox" then :/
[04:09] <bitpimp> I am running a ubuntu 10.04 server and installed rails through the repos; I need to update rails due to the recent exploit; any suggestions?
[04:09] <root_> .
[04:11] <krzkrz> i hate how you have to type ctrl+shift v or c to paste or copy in terminal
[04:11] <dr_willis> hmm a security fix should get put in to the  normal updates i would think
[04:11] <krzkrz> couldnt they have just made it ctrl+c and ctrl+v
[04:11] <dr_willis> or use a ppa , or source for a newer version
[04:12] <Aironet> Hi I am having wireless connectivity problems using Xubuntu anyone have advice?
[04:12] <dr_willis> krzkrz:  ctrl-c was used by bash/unix befor MS took it over for pasteing
[04:12] <dr_willis> krzkrz:  i tend to just select/middle click the mouse
[04:13] <ogist> it says the link is broken
[04:13] <dr_willis> ogist:  perhaps you did a typo
[04:14] <krzkrz> dr_willis, im coming from macosx. the interface and shortcuts in osx look more consistent
[04:14] <chmac> Does Thunderbird have a stop button? It's been downloading 70/100 messages in my inbox for >5 minutes. I want to cancel it and start over...
[04:14] <emes> I'm trying to install acroread on 12.10, but it requires libgtk2.0-0:i386 which apt-get barfs when I try to install
[04:14] <dr_willis> ogist:  running a game via a link may not work properly. a shell script may be a better idea
[04:15] <ogist> ok
[04:15] <ogist> yeah
[04:15] <dr_willis> a launcher.desktop file running a script may be an even better idea
[04:15] <ogist> it just opens and closes
[04:15] <ogist> ok
[04:15] <dr_willis> many games/apps NEED to be ran from their 'data' directory
[04:15] <ogist> it came with a .desktop file
[04:15] <dr_willis> it may have came with a script as well. ;)
[04:15] <ogist> actually the tar.gz file came with bin share and lib, i had to move the bin file to the share and the lib file to the share/baseq2
[04:15] <jake_> it still appears to not all be removed. why?
[04:16] <dr_willis> theres also updated versions of quake2 i recall that just use the games original  data files
[04:16] <ogist> then i go into the folder and double click quake2
[04:16] <krzkrz> dr_willis, what version of ubunut are you using. im curious?
[04:16] <dr_willis> using 12.10 on  my desktop box.
[04:16] <dr_willis> been using my raspberry Pi more ttthis month.   however.
[04:17] <dr_willis> ogist:  running from terminal will print any error messages. and better for trouble shooting
[04:17] <ogist> Untrusted application Launcher when i open Quake II.desktop
[04:17] <krzkrz> dr_willis, raspberry Pi?
[04:17] <dr_willis> Yep. Got me a Raspberry Pi running as my znc server now
[04:17] <mansoor-s> I am unable to connect to my server with SSH (http://pastie.org/private/yr4niedzxdhzz1ojgakqrq). Could anyone take a look and tell me whats going on?
[04:18] <ogist> dr_willis: i downloaded this tar.gz file for quake2, it has it compiled already but the executable comes in a folder by itself and i had to put it in with the share folder to get it to work
[04:18] <ogist> im not sure where i am supposed to move all these files, so i just copied the bin file and lib files to the share dir and i run the executable from there and it works
[04:18] <dr_willis> ogist:  came from where?
[04:18] <MTsol> Is there a way I can download the additional driver straight from windows?
[04:19] <ogist> http://quake2world.net/files/quake2-quake2world.net-x86_64.tar.gz
[04:19] <ogist> this is the file
[04:19] <ogist> it's precompiled
[04:19] <bazhang> MTsol, driver for what
[04:19] <ogist> i just dont know what to do with the folders
[04:19] <ogist> bin share and lib
[04:19] <ogist> that's what is in the tar.gz file
[04:20] <ogist> also Quake II.desktop
[04:20] <MTsol> bazhang: Well I'm having the display issue but I got it to come up by pressing the brightness key but now its having trouble keeping a wireless connection
[04:20] <bazhang> MTsol, driver for what
[04:21] <MTsol> And if I do get it to connect to wireless it has trouble staying connected
[04:21] <bentinata> tompa, it named vbox
[04:21] <MTsol> So i guess ubuntu wureless drivers?
[04:21] <memand> Okay this is officially driving me mad now, I have a terminal window that I have set up to act like a Transparent terminal background. And that is all fine, exept that when I do "show desktop" in compiz for example, it also dissapears. I have tried to set a window rule in compiz that this window should be un-minimizable and unmovable, but no luck there...
[04:21] <bazhang> MTsol, what chipset
[04:22] <dr_willis> ogist:  id say check their docs. Most likely you can copuy them all to the /usr/share  directory
[04:22] <MTsol> bazhang: How do I find that out?
[04:23] <ogist> dr_willis
[04:23] <ogist> lib bin share
[04:23] <ogist> thats what is in the tar gz file
[04:23] <tompa> bentinata oh... unfortunatly it didnt work either :(    "E: Unable to locate package vbox"
[04:24] <usr13> MTsol: lspci |grep ireless
[04:24] <bentinata> tompa, you can see the system monitor to find out that program name
[04:24] <MTsol> usr13: I'm on windows atm
[04:24] <usr13> O
[04:24] <bentinata> hahahaa
[04:25] <MTsol> Cant keep a steady connection on ubuntu
[04:25] <Aironet> I need help connecting aironet cardbus to xubuntu 12.10 can anyone help? Thank you in advance
[04:27] <Aironet> Anyone?
[04:27] <bentinata> not me, sorry :(
[04:27] <MTsol> Would I need a wireless driver? Or?

[04:28] <Aironet> It connects under eth0 but wont show under connections in the upper right hand corner

[04:29] <MTsol> Aironet: anyone I guess.
[04:29] <tompa> benitnata yea that was the case, I spelled wrong "VIRITUALbox" and didnt find it in ubuntu software center, so i search for some random command on internet

[04:30] <mansoor-s> I am unable to connect to my server with SSH (http://pastie.org/private/yr4niedzxdhzz1ojgakqrq). Could anyone take a look and tell me whats going on?
[04:31] <somsip> mansoor-s: it's strange that your ~/.ssh/mansoor.pem is tried as a private key but only publickey auth methods can continue. Could this be an issue? I've not seen it before, but can't say I connect with -v very often...
[04:31] <MTsol> Do I need to download the additional drivers oackage to resolve my issue?
[04:31] <somsip> mansoor-s: and you usually need to connect as ubuntu@ec2... so maybe that would help
[04:31] <mansoor-s> somsip, -v means verbose, it spits out all of the information
[04:32] <somsip> mansoor-s: I know what it means. I just don't have to use it
[04:32] <servvs> how can I get the wimax to work on an intel 6150 wimax card?
[04:32] <bentinata> tompa, is the executable inside that folder? you can directly delete it
[04:32] <mansoor-s> somsip, I don't either, when it works XD
[04:32] <mansoor-s> ubuntu@ doesnt' work either :(
[04:33] <somsip> mansoor-s: ok - my EC2 pem shows as private in -v but connects fine so it's a red herring
[04:33] <MTsol> Do I need to download the additional drivers oackage to resolve my issue?
[04:33] <somsip> mansoor-s: and you used mansoor key when you started the instance? Have you ever been able to connect to this one?
[04:33] <tompa> bentinata im afraid not, what is the equivalence to .exe in linux?
[04:33] <bentinata> tompa, none
[04:33] <usr13> MTsol: We don't know.
[04:33] <bentinata> tompa, it marked as executable
[04:34] <mansoor-s> somsip, hmm, i created the key, but how do I "use" it with the instance?
[04:34] <adoniscik> rhymthbox behaves differently depending on whether I run it from the command line or Dash. If I use the icon, I get "network connection" errors. Why might this be?
[04:34] <bentinata> tompa, you can even execute a .txt file
[04:34] <mansoor-s> i rebooted the instance after creating the key, and this is the first time i'm trying to ssh into the server
[04:34] <somsip> mansoor-s: when you cereate the instance, it's on the...4th setup screen
[04:34] <usr13> tompa: A file that has the executable bit set to it.
[04:34] <servvs> how can I get the wimax to work on an intel 6150 wimax card?
[04:35] <somsip> mansoor-s: well that's a fail then. You must add PEM keys when you create, or you can do it after but you need to upload the key and suchlike
=== aberrant_ is now known as aberrant
[04:35] <usr13> tompa: Linux does not need file-names to determine whether it's executable or not.
[04:35] <mansoor-s> somsip, AHH you are onto it
[04:35] <mansoor-s> the instance is already created, i must figure out how to set the key after its been created
[04:36] <tompa> bentinata hmm okey, however i don't think it is
[04:36] <somsip> mansoor-s: yes
[04:36] <bentinata> tompa, how you install the virtualbox?
[04:36] <tompa> user13 okey :) just took it for granted it was built on the same idea
[04:37] <tompa> bentinata I followed the commands at this link http://www.noobslab.com/2012/04/install-virtualbox-4112-on-ubuntu.html
[04:40] <bentinata> tompa, wait, I'm opening it, and probably for a long time (my connection is slower than snail)
[04:40] <tompa> bentinata no worries I'm glad someone even answering ! :)
[04:41] <usr13> tompa: You know that you could just use the package manager.  You can do it from command line:  sudo apt-get install virtualbox
[04:42] <usr13> tompa: and    sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils
[04:42] <adoniscik> rhymthbox behaves differently depending on whether I run it from the command line or Dash. If I use the icon, I get "network connection" errors. Why might this be?
[04:42] <mansoor-s> thank you very much somsip
[04:42] <somsip> mansoor-s: np
[04:43] <tompa> usr13 I did spell wrong first time "VIRITUALbox" and thought it wasnt in the default ppa...
[04:43] <usr13> tompa: If you didn't know, you could do a search, like:  apt-cache search virtual |grep box
[04:43] <usr13> tompa: Do it now so you'll see.
[04:46] <tompa> usr13 hmm what does that information tell me? Did i do a search in the default ppa for "box" ? and the result is the hits of the search?
[04:47] <bentinata> I'm new to IRC, and I like this. this is better than listening my teacher up ahead. xD
[04:47] <tompa> bentinata what are u studying?
[04:48] <cub> what is a gflop?
[04:48] <GerbilSoft> cub: surface rt ;)
[04:48] <GerbilSoft> actually "gigaflop"
[04:49] <GerbilSoft> i.e. one billion floating point operations per second
[04:49] <usr13> tompa: It showed you available (authorized) packages that can be installed.
[04:50] <cub> how do i find a certain process in terminal
[04:50] <cub> for example.. locate apache or chrome
[04:50] <somsip> cub: locate apache; locate chrome
[04:50] <cub> and ty GerbilSoft
[04:50] <tompa> usr13 okey :) is it always searching in the default OS version's repository?
[04:51] <bentinata> tompa, oh
[04:51] <cub> okay somsip, and this will show me the process too as well as ID?
[04:51] <bentinata> tompa, try sudo apt-get remove virtualbox-4.1
[04:51] <usr13> tompa: You are always better off installing packages via the package manager. Pretty much anything you could want is available via Ubuntu's package manager.  If you install only from the package manager, you'll be assured everything will work as expected.  When you deviate from that method, things may not work well for you.
[04:51] <somsip> cub: it will show you where it is in the filesystem. Do you want something like 'ps aux' instead?
[04:51] <cub> yes
[04:51] <usr13> tompa: Yes, that is correct
[04:54] <cub> somsip how would i find a certain process by name then?
[04:54] <cub> ps aux -C ?
[04:54] <somsip> cub: I'd grep it - ps aux | grep apache
[04:54] <bentinata> tompa, according to your tutorial try "sudo apt-get remove virtualbox-4.1"
[04:54] <usr13> cub: ps aux |grep process-name
[04:54] <cub> whats grep do?
[04:55] <cfhowlett> cub, info grep or man grep on the terminal will tell you
[04:55] <somsip> cub: outputs lines that match a string/expression
[04:55] <tompa> usr13 yeah i know, as I said i search for it but couldnt find it so I assumed it wasnt included (as many other programs ain't). Thank you for all handy information love the support!
[04:55] <usr13> cub: grep print lines matching a pattern
[04:55] <cub> ok ty
[04:55] <tompa> bentinata yeah it worked! Thanks. how did you find the name of the file?
[04:56] <bentinata> tompa, your link just finished loaded
[04:56] <bentinata> xD
[04:57] <tompa> bentinata lol
[05:06] <challenger> ??
[05:07] <challenger> hlwwww
[05:07] <bentinata> challenger, yo?
[05:08] <challenger> bentinata, i'm having problem regarding connection speed
[05:08] <challenger> it was working fine .. but from last couple of days its getting slow down
[05:08] <dr_willis> apt-get supports tab completion. so  apt-get remove vir<tab> should  have shown a list  that should have included  virtualbox. :)   for future referance
[05:09] <challenger> sometime it gets disconnected after 10-15 min
[05:09] <challenger> don't know what to do
[05:10] <dr_willis> could be interfearnce from some one elses stuff
[05:10] <challenger> :|
[05:10] <bentinata> maybe it cause your provider
[05:10] <dr_willis> if you are on wireless
[05:10] <challenger> no .. i'm on wired connection
[05:10] <dr_willis> cable? dsl? other?
[05:10] <challenger> i 've checked out everything  ..network card.. preference,
[05:11] <challenger> dsl connection
[05:11] <randomjay> im in asia, everything is always slow :/ other computers on the network are not suffering from speed drops?
[05:12] <MK`> What is the name of the laptop battery applet in 11.10 for gnome fallback? Mine crashed, want to reenable it.
[05:13] <challenger> is there any command i can use here to show u my sys info?
[05:13] <challenger> inxi isn't wrking
[05:13] <challenger> dr_willis? interference? magnetic? electrical ? what kinda?
[05:14] <MK`> Which sys info challenger?
[05:14] <challenger> like network info ?
[05:14] <MK`> ah, I do not know about that
[05:15] <challenger> MK` : :)
[05:16] <onborad> us
[05:16] <challenger> phew .. now i'm thinking of switching to mint or arch
[05:16] <challenger> (maybe its a bad idea) but don't know what to do know
[05:16] <seednode> Arch is an... interesting experience
[05:17] <onborad> use UEFI only  start ubuntu 12.04 version ,Xorg couldn't start ,and report  [     6.275] (II) VESA(0): initializing int10
[05:17] <seednode> Speaking from two years of using it
[05:17] <onborad> [     6.276] (EE) VESA(0): V_BIOS address 0xd00 out of range
[05:17] <onborad> any one ideas?
[05:17] <challenger> seednode: really .. i didn't give it try ever
[05:17] <challenger> afraid of loosing data during installation
[05:17] <seednode> If you're annoyed with Ubuntu about having issues
[05:17] <seednode> You might want to avoid Arch
[05:17] <challenger> people say that its hard to configure it during installation
[05:17] <seednode> It's fun, and an interesting hobby
[05:18] <seednode> But it requires quite a bit of tweaking to work well
[05:18] <seednode> Eh, installation isn't bad.
[05:18] <onborad> (EE) VESA(0): V_BIOS address 0xd00 out of range
[05:18] <seednode> All command line, though
[05:18] <challenger> phew
[05:19] <seednode> So if you're newish to Linux, I'd avoid it
[05:19] <seednode> I don't know how much experience you have
[05:19] <challenger> before i can download arch i need to get out of this prob.. cann't download bcoz of slow and unstable connection
[05:19] <challenger> seednode: i'm not so bad at cmdline
[05:20] <seednode> Well, honestly, ALL conf is command line
[05:20] <rypervenche> challenger: How long have you been using Linux?
[05:20] <challenger> i have 2 year experience
[05:20] <seednode> There are no GUIs by default
[05:20] <seednode> Only those from the DE/WM you install
[05:20] <challenger> i hate eye candy stuffs like win 8  or unity
[05:20] <rypervenche> Then I'd say it's possible for you.
[05:20] <seednode> I use Openbox with Arch

[05:25] <osmrducks> whre do i get a free version of ubuntu
[05:25] <challenger> now  to the main point.. i'm still in trouble
[05:25] <osmrducks> ?
[05:25] <xangua> izx: maverick has no longer support....since 2011
[05:25] <xangua> osmrducks: from ubuntu.com
[05:25] <challenger> couldn't find solution to my prob
[05:25] <bentinata> osmrducks, Ubuntu is FREE
[05:25] <osmrducks> and is free? the one i can run off disk?
[05:26] <bentinata> osmrducks, yes
[05:26] <izx> xangua: This cacher server runs fine till yesterday.. It was there since 2009
[05:26] <randomjay> if you are talking about a physical cd, i think you might have to pay for shipping, right?
[05:26] <osmrducks> all plaaces ive tryed to get they want money for
[05:26] <zg> I had an issue installing the bootloader, what do I do? I chose /dev/sdb, but that didn't help
[05:26] <randomjay> downloading an image that you can burn onto a cd yourself is free of charge.
[05:26] <osmrducks> i will go to it tho thanks.. im new to linux... heard it was awesome and wanted to try it
[05:26] <bentinata> osmrducks, I always download it at ubuntu.com, and burn the CD myself
[05:27] <randomjay> this is probably what you are after: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
[05:27] <kunji> osmrducks: Use a USB drive, don't even need to waste a CD ^_^
[05:27] <osmrducks> and can i use it on a laptop?
[05:27] <seednode> osmrducks, yes
[05:27] <randomjay> not sure where youve been looking if they want to charge you money for a copy of ubuntu
[05:27] <bentinata> osmrducks, yes you can
[05:27] <osmrducks> cool
[05:27] <osmrducks> thank u all
[05:28] <bentinata> they charge for shipping, it worth it
[05:28] <seednode> On any x86/x64 computer, usually
[05:28] <osmrducks> i thought u could download it?
[05:28] <seednode> You can do both
[05:28] <bentinata> oh, I'm just discussing, download is free
[05:28] <osmrducks> where to download?  ubuntu.com?
[05:28] <bentinata> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
[05:29] <Malimbar> would this be a decent place to debug a problem with Steam?
[05:29] <randomjay> bentinata, i never tried ordering a dvd myself.. is there anything else included in the shipment but a disc? such as.. i dont know.. documentation? fun freebies?
[05:29] <challenger> arghhh !!!!!!
[05:29] <zg> Malimbar: perhaps #steamlug

[05:30] <challenger> obottu: :D (:X)
[05:30] <bentinata> randomjay, me too, but my friend buy it, and he get ~20 dvd
[05:30] <pianoman> hello, i tried installing ubuntu via dvd but when the menu to choose for installing or trying it, it took me to a black screen and not the ubuntu looking screen that it should have been. when i hit install it didn
[05:30] <pianoman> t work
[05:30] <osmrducks> so the ubuntu desktop will work on laptop?
[05:30] <osmrducks> =)
[05:30] <randomjay> osmrducks yes
[05:30] <osmrducks> k sorry for all the questions
[05:31] <bentinata> osmrducks, no worry
[05:31] <challenger> pianoman. may be you are installing ubuntu in txt mode
[05:31] <randomjay> no its ok. they just call it the desktop version because its for desktop/workstation use, and that includes your laptop. the other two options are Server and Cloud, which you probably wont have to worry about just yet ;q
[05:31] <dr_willis> !nomodeset
[05:31] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[05:32] <pianoman> well i burned it to the disc correctly and it automatically detected it and started. but the installation failed. what does the txt mode mean?
[05:32] <challenger> which one version are you trying to install? pianoman
[05:33] <pianoman> 12.10
[05:33] <challenger> maybe obottu is right pianoman
[05:34] <dr_willis> try the nomodeset option
[05:35] <challenger> pianoman,  you can post screenshot here if you have one
[05:36] <pianoman> i'm not sure how to do it. the best i can describe it though is that it looks like  normal black boot screen. it has a short code and says it failed challenger
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[05:37] <challenger> pianoman . try to install it in vbox
[05:37] <challenger> virtualbox = vbox
[05:38] <pianoman> how do i do that?
[05:38] <challenger> currently what os are you using?
[05:38] <pianoman> im using windows 8
[05:38] <challenger> than download virtualbox from virtualbox.org
[05:39] <challenger> and install it . u can install ubuntu 12.10 through its image
[05:39] <challenger> it will be handy
[05:39] <challenger> if you are new to linux or afraid to use it
[05:39] <challenger> just give a try to vbox
[05:40] <challenger> don't need to make real partition or disk formatting
[05:40] <dr_willis> vbox is to handy to not use ;)
[05:40] <dr_willis> a little linux disrto in vbox can be a lot of fun and usefull
[05:41] <challenger> dr_willis: in case of data risk( data lose)
[05:41] <challenger> it will be handy if u just want to give a try
[05:41] <Aditya^_> hey guys
[05:41] <Aditya^_> i am running windows 8 and wana get dual boot
[05:41] <Aditya^_> i have the iso file
[05:41] <Aditya^_> how to install via usb
[05:42] <pianoman> well i've already tried ubuntu. i want to install it but its still not working. why?
[05:42] <dr_willis> use one of the many tools to 'burn' the iso to usb making a live usb. the pendrivelinux site has several to try  Aditya^_
[05:42] <dr_willis> Aditya^_:  then boot the usb and use the installer.
[05:43] <dr_willis> ive no idea how windows 8 will affect things however
[05:43] <dr_willis> when in doubt.. make backups first
[05:43] <pianoman> i have the same issue as aditya.
[05:43] <young001> 如何判断一个句子是不是全是由英文字母组成的?标点符号在里面也可以
[05:43] <young001> 就是给一个句子，判断是不是全是英文
[05:43] <leku> pianoman
[05:43] <pianoman> i'd be happy to make a usb if i knew itd work
[05:43] <leku> could be EFI boot vs bios boot
[05:43] <Ben64> !cn
[05:43] <ubottu> 如欲獲得中文的協助，請輸入 /join #ubuntu-cn 或 /join #ubuntu-tw
[05:43] <leku> or problem with secure boot?
[05:43] <challenger>  aditya: use UNetbootin
[05:43] <pianoman> the difference being?
[05:44] <dr_willis> theres dozens of tools/ways to make a bootable usb from the ISO.
[05:44] <challenger> u can make any usb bootable through it
[05:44] <challenger> very easy to use tool
[05:44] <leku> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[05:44] <challenger> unetbootin
[05:44] <young001> how to judge if a sentence is all consisted by english
[05:44] <dr_willis> lookl at the pendricelinux site and see whats there challenger
[05:44] <dr_willis> pendrivelinux.org or .com.. i forget
[05:45] <challenger> dr_willis, okay sir
[05:45] <dr_willis> some people have issues with some tools, or otehrs.. so its  ok to try several
[05:45] <dr_willis> i like the pendrivelinux tool thst lets me put several differnt isos on the same  large flash drive
[05:45] <Aditya^_> pendrive linux i should try?
[05:46] <fmedina> hello
[05:46] <dr_willis> Aditya^_:  its a site with tools to put iso on usb/flash... if thatts what you need to do
[05:46] <challenger> dr_willis: then whats d prob with using unetbootin?
[05:47] <dr_willis> challenger:  ive had unetbootin NOT work.. thats why i reccomend s site that lists several tools
[05:47] <challenger> unetbootin allows to create bootable usb without burning to cd/dvd
[05:47] <fmedina> fixing up my X1 Carbon with Ubuntu 12.10... want to custom kernel to get rid of unwanted stuff, anyone have a working config for kernel 3.7 for X1 Carbon by any chance?  first attempt did not boot :-)
[05:47] <dr_willis> so do dozens of other tools
[05:47] <challenger> dr_willis: but it worked for me sir :)
[05:47] <dr_willis> challenger:  and ive had it not work dozens of times
[05:48] <fmedina> is there a place for working configs on custom kernels for different machines?
[05:48] <Aditya^_> downloaded one from there
[05:48] <Aditya^_> its running
[05:48] <dr_willis> some times theres version issues, or weird usb  quirks.
[05:48] <dr_willis> and often some tools you may find at the pendrivelinux site have neat other features.. like multi iso. or they can auto download the iso. or other cool features
[05:49] <Aditya^_> after it finishes i need to  reboot and boot from usb ?
[05:49] <challenger> dr_willis, grt
[05:49] <dr_willis> Aditya^_:  thats the normal procedure yes
[05:49] <dr_willis> Aditya^_:  you have backed up imprornt stuff?
[05:50] <Aditya^_> i am installing it on other partition
[05:50] <dr_willis> if theres a power failure or other issue during the instsaller resizeing your existing system.. thst can be very bad
[05:50] <Aditya^_> its empty
[05:50] <dr_willis> if otehr partion allready exists.. that makes it much easier. ;)
[05:50] <challenger> now time to leave .. .
[05:51] <Aditya^_> Creating the persistant file
[05:51] <Aditya^_> persistence*
[05:52] <dr_willis> just for installing you really dont need one. ;) but it wont hurt
[05:52] <g00053> oh #ubuntu, how I heart you
[05:52] <Aditya^_> dr willis
[05:52] <Aditya^_> restarting
[05:52] <Aditya^_> time to see if it works
[05:54] <wting> How do I list all the ppas added via add-apt-repository? It's not in /etc/apt/sources.list...
[05:55] <dr_willis> wting:  sources.list.d
[05:55] <dr_willis>  each ppa has its own config files
[05:55] <wting> ahh ok, thankd dr_willis
[05:55] <dr_willis> makes it easy to see whats there ;)
[05:56] <dr_willis> the old way of altering sources.list is a bit of a no no these days
[06:06] <leku> how come when I start e17, I still see a bunch of unity processes running?
[06:07] <leku> how do I kill this crap
[06:07] <wting> dr_willis: I don't know, I'm still stuck in my old ways. It's a lot easier to add/remove ppas. So far ppa-purge and apt-add-repository --remove have failed.
[06:07] <dD0T> I have disabled system wide proxy and yet get $http_proxy set. I can't figure out where this is done. Nothing in .bashrc, bash_aliases, /etc/environment. This is Ubuntu 12.10. Any ideas where this might come from? Thanks.
[06:09] <mesquka> Hi
[06:09] <osmrducks> can i run the ubuntu dl off my hd?
[06:09] <dr_willis> osmrducks:  you mean run the ISO file?
[06:10] <dr_willis> vbox can boot an ISO file
[06:10] <osmrducks> where to get the vbox>
[06:10] <osmrducks> ?
[06:10] <dr_willis> at its homepage
[06:10] <dr_willis> !vbox
[06:10] <ubottu> Virtualbox is a virtualizer for x86 and amd64 architectures.

[06:10] <BlackDalek> are there any soloutions for the "ubuntu 12.10 will not install past first step" problem?
[06:10] <dr_willis> im not sure how well unity works in  vbox
[06:11] <dr_willis> what first step BlackDalek ?
[06:13] <nibbler> in which order are the initramfs-tools scripts executed? is init-premount always executed before local-top?
[06:13] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, the window which is titled "Preparing to install Ubuntu" and has "download updates" ticked and "install third-party software"... click continue and the spinning pointer appears and installer stalls at that point with no further action evident.
[06:14] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  networking is enabled?
[06:15] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, it is connected wirelessly to the local network. This is the same issue this person has here  - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2081850 no solution was found there either and I couldn't find aother thread with the same problem.
[06:16] <osmrducks> dr which virtual box should i get?
[06:16] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, I too and trying to install the 32bit regular ubuntu to a 64bit PC.... same as original poster in that thread. Do you think trying the 64bit version of 12.10 would make a difference?
[06:17] <osmrducks> i dont want to install it.... i want to run it first and see if i like it... ive never tryed it before and see what its all about
[06:18] <kryfox> yo
[06:18] <gnomefreak> anyne know if there is a command that starts with the word "paste"?
[06:19] <gnomefreak> anyone even
[06:19] <g00053> running it from an hd or vb or usb will not net the same performance as installing tho ?
[06:19] <magn3ts> gnomefreak, yes.
[06:19] <nibbler> gnomefreak: apt-file search bin/paste
[06:19] <gnomefreak> magn3ts: thanks
[06:20]  * nibbler still wonders why apt-file is not installed by default....

[06:24] <ozzloy> rhythmbox sometimes stops playback on .flac files.  i tried deleting ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry.x86_64.bin and that worked for a few songs, but it stops on flac songs still
[06:24] <ozzloy> how do i make rhythmbox play flac songs always?
[06:25] <petergk> hey all
[06:25] <dr_willis> could be its stopping because of the encoding of the flac.. does it always stop on the same file?
[06:26] <ozzloy> dr_willis, not sure.  next time it stops on a song i'll try deleting that file and trying it again
[06:26] <ozzloy> "deleting" actually i'm moving it
[06:27] <dr_willis> just jot down what file its stopping on.. and try to play it by itself
[06:27] <ozzloy> definitely more than one flac file
[06:28] <ozzloy> and they were all created in the last week or so
[06:28] <ozzloy> my whole cd collection was ripped
[06:28] <dr_willis> if every file from the cd that was ripped the same way.. has issues.. that points to some file format or bug in the app
[06:28] <dr_willis> unless its having issues reading the files from hd.
[06:29] <ozzloy> all the files were ripped in the same way
[06:29] <ozzloy> some play, some don't
[06:29] <dr_willis> dmesg may show if theres any IO errors
[06:31] <ozzloy> interesting
[06:31] <ozzloy> this time all i had to do was double click the file in the playlist and it started playing
[06:31] <ozzloy> wtf wtf
[06:32] <dr_willis> so it played like 10 songs.. then stopped.. then you started it again
[06:32] <dr_willis> with the 11th
[06:36] <ozzloy> something like that
[06:36] <ozzloy> i'm waiting for it to die again
[06:36] <dr_willis> it wont do it while you are watching.....
[06:36] <dr_willis> ;)
[06:36] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, do you think that there is anyway to install 12.10 on a PC which can't get past first step of installer or do you think there might be a way around it?
[06:37] <ozzloy> maybe i'll start rhythmbox from terminal and watch for debug output
[06:37] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  Run the installer from a terminal. look for error messages.  you did try unchecking the boxs >
[06:37] <grendal-prime> what in the hell is going on with getdeb.net?
[06:37] <dr_willis> grendal-prime:  been down for like a month i think
[06:37] <grendal-prime> is it ever going to be back up?
[06:38] <grendal-prime> jesus ill give them a server if they need it
[06:38] <grendal-prime> wtf
[06:38] <dr_willis> no idea. ;) i never really used the site
[06:38] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, how do I run the installer from the terminal?
[06:38] <dr_willis> command is 'ubiquity' i think BlackDalek
[06:38] <mayank> how do i install my canon lbp2900 printer on ubuntu 12.10
[06:38] <grendal-prime> mayank,  plug it in
[06:39] <user__> exit
[06:39] <user__> quit
[06:39] <mayank> its plugged in and on, but no drivers for lbp2900
[06:39] <user__> \quit
[06:39] <grendal-prime> that is a total guess by the way but that seems to work for me with every other printer ive worked with
[06:41] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, could you possibly be a bit less vague... i.e.  Do I boot into a live session from the installed CD, the open a terminal window and type ubiquity.. or do I boot up in the old OS (11.10) and use a terminal from that then insert the installer CD, or use a ctrl+alt+F1 terminal?
[06:41] <dr_willis> check the cups.org site and the linuxprinting.org site to see if its supported at all.
[06:41] <dr_willis> canon is rather poor in their linux support
[06:41] <dr_willis> on the live cd. open a terminal  and run 'gksudo ubiquity'
[06:41] <dr_willis> you dont install from within a installed os
[06:41] <mayank> its showing other model drivers but not lbp2900
[06:42] <mayank> how do i download drivers for ubuntu 12.10
[06:42] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, ok... I will give it a go and see if I get any errors ;)
[06:42] <dr_willis> mayank:  perhaps one of those may work if they are similer.  check the package manager for canon drivers if you cant select them from the printer config dialogs
[06:42] <dr_willis> or 'apt-cache search canon' and see whaats there
[06:44] <mayank> where to use apt-cache?, whats the whole command?

[06:48] <onborad> any one ideas
[06:49] <haracha> how do i activate a program on a mounted .iso from cli
[06:49] <ozzloy> dr_willis, it stopped again!
[06:49] <mayank> ok willis, its shows full page something....but now wat?
[06:50] <dr_willis> Aditya^:  you could partion the hd how you want using the advanced features of the installer.  you normally need 2 partitions, one for '/'  of type ext4 and one for 'swap' of the type swap
[06:50] <guest16> haracha, find out the path where it is mounted, typically it's under /media/
[06:50] <dr_willis> mayank:  install any canon drivers you may find listed.
[06:50] <haracha> it displays a garbage filepath without slashes instead it has the % codes & it hints at ~
[06:50] <haracha> or /home/user/
[06:50] <haracha> something
[06:51] <Bneyt> hi, Anybody have any experience installing the Realtek r8168 drivers?
[06:51] <dr_willis> mount command should show the mountpoints
[06:51] <mayank> its says already installed
[06:52] <mayank> but still not printout wen i give the print command
[06:52] <mayank> i dont understand
[06:53] <haracha> how do i change permissions on a default app mounted .iso
[06:54] <dr_willis> haracha:   why are you needing to do that? change what permissions?
[06:55] <Chad__> Can anyone answer a quick question I have about rsnapshot (rsnapshot irc channel is dead).
[06:55] <haracha> x a cutable
[06:55] <haracha> and i wanna install one of my favorite games :>
[06:56] <dr_willis> haracha:  use  wine  /path/to/the/whatever.exe
[06:56] <sameerfx_> Can someone help me with some partitioning in gparted? Here is the issue I'm running into: http://gparted-forum.surf4.info/viewtopic.php?id=16754
[06:56] <dr_willis> the idea of double clicking a .exe and it running.. is.. well problematic
[06:56] <sameerfx_> basically, I have 4 primary partitions, one of which is extended.
=== amagee is now known as i
[06:56] <sameerfx_> I can't create a new logical partition in that extended partition
[06:56] <dr_willis> since for some ODD reason they have decided the .exe needs to be executable for 'security' reasons
[06:56] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, tried running ubiquity from terminal of live session... not one single error or piece of info appeared in the terminal window. Installer still stalls at same point. Also tried with both boxes un-checked... :(    No solution exists?
[06:56] <dr_willis> which is no security at all
[06:57] <sameerfx_> Here is a screenshot of the error: http://i.imgur.com/wxdZB.png
=== i is now known as amagee
[06:57] <amagee> hey, i'm trying to increase my open file limit
[06:57] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  checedked the forums?  and askubuntu.com? ive never heard of that problem happening in here befor
[06:57] <sameerfx_> amagee, have you tried ulimit?
[06:57] <amagee> i've put "amagee hard nofile 50000" and "amagee soft nofile 50000" in /etc/security/limits.conf, but i still can't use "ulimit -n 50000" to increase it
[06:58] <amagee> it says "bash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted"
[06:58] <guest16> sameerfx_: first extend the logical partition over the unallocated space, then select the "new" unallocated area that you'll see in the logical partition
[06:58] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, I've been trying google before I came here (still looking now as we speak) and that one post on the forums is all I've managed to come up with so far...
[06:59] <guest16> sameerfx_: the first step is, select the logical partition, then click the button above with the the arrow.
[06:59] <sameerfx_> amagee, did you try sudoing that? (run it as root?)
[06:59] <guest16> Sorry, first select the /extended/ partition.
[06:59] <guest16> replace logical with extended in my comments above.
[06:59] <amagee> yes, but it doesn't work (also, ulimit is user-specific so that doesn't really make sense in this case)
[07:00] <sameerfx_> guest16, trying that now
[07:00] <guest16> To select the extended partition, you click the border, not the area inside (which would select the logical partitions instead)
[07:00] <guest16> The cyan border.
[07:00] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  tehres  may be some logs in /var/log   it could be its a bad cd/dvd burn also. You tried it on a differnt machine?
[07:01] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, it is the same DVD which installed to this very PC I am talking to you on now.
[07:02] <sameerfx_> guest16, will I need to reboot into a liveCD to do this?
[07:02] <sameerfx_> Under the Extended partition, 2 of the partitions are / and /home.
[07:02] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  dirty work around...  do a full install to a 8gb usb flash drive... then  use dd to image that flash to the HD of the problem pc. ;) then gparted to resize the partitons
[07:02] <sameerfx_> So maybe since those partitions are mounted, I may not be able to expand the Extended area?
[07:02] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  or swap the HDS  install.. put it back in the problem box
[07:03] <sameerfx_> I clicked on the cyan border, but resize is grayed out
[07:03] <haracha> dr_willis i put the .iso on a virtual mount point which i haven't exposed to my brains as to where yet
[07:03] <dr_willis> you dont resize in use/mounted filesystems
[07:03] <guest16> I don't know.
[07:03] <sameerfx_> I'll try to do that, thanks.
[07:03] <bnathan> hi, does anybody here have any experience installing the realtek r8168 drivers?
[07:03] <dr_willis> haracha:  huh?
[07:03] <haracha> my computer has the .exe mounted on a virtual drive which i don't yet understand how to pinpoint in CLI :I

[07:04] <bnathan> hi, does anybody here have any experience installing the realtek r8168 drivers?
[07:05] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, that HD swap idea almost sounded perfect! until I realised the problem machine's HD is sata and my only other 12.10 capable PCs are IDE :(
[07:05] <haracha> no no i mounted it with the default app that comes with mister ubuntu current :3
[07:05] <dr_willis> haracha:  see where the mount command says its at.
[07:05] <bnathan> hi, does anybody here have any experience installing the realtek r8168 drivers?
[07:05] <dr_willis> haracha:  or mount it by hand.
[07:05] <dr_willis> !iso
[07:05] <ubottu> To mount an ISO disc image, type « sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint> » - There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before !burning.

[07:08] <TakeItEZ> !anyone | bnathan
[07:08] <ubottu> bnathan: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
=== ericab is now known as ericab_away
[07:08] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, and the full install to a flash drive workaround sounds bad.. in that it sounds like it will wipe all the data from the problem PC :( furthermore, I just found this - http://askubuntu.com/questions/204771/ubuntu-12-10-installation-hangs-at-preparing-to-install-ubuntu which seems to suggest that the way around the problem is to format the drive :(
[07:08] <bnathan> !details
[07:08] <ubottu> Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[07:11] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, this PC was a clean install, so that goes with the theory of it needing a clean drive to avoid the problem (on PCs which experience the problem)
[07:14] <dr_willis> sounds liek the installer cant figure out the partuon layout if  the fix suggests a reformat
[07:14] <dr_willis> you may be able to partion it by hand/resize/leave part unallocated first.. then start the installer
[07:16] <dr_willis> if the HD layout is the issue. then i would expect the problem to happen on a differnt machine if you swaped hds also

[07:28] <Geet_> how to create a shortcut icon for a command line
[07:28] <dr_willis> other then in 'just look dont touch' prototypes. :)
[07:28] <chiques> dr_willis, just curious, thanks
[07:29] <dr_willis> Geet_:  copy a existing .desktop launcher  somewhere  and edit it
[07:29] <dr_willis> Ill belivec in the ubuntu phone when i can actually go and buy one at the store/internet. ;)
[07:29] <dr_willis> ive had so many letdowns with Overyhyped  and vaporware hardware over the years
[07:29] <dr_willis> Vaporhardware? ;)
[07:30] <Geet_> what is a .desktop launcher?
[07:31] <Geet_> dr_willis ^
[07:31] <dr_willis> every gui app has a corseponding .desktop file
[07:31] <dr_willis> look at gedit.desktop for example
[07:31] <bnathan> hi dr willis, I did a modprobe -l and it showed that the module was there
[07:31] <chiques> dr_willis, Nokia's Samba was OK, if they could port just half of the the Ubuntu apps it would be amazing but your right, it's like those amazing concept cars GM is always promising to make available.
[07:31] <dr_willis> bnathan:  if the module loads.. look at dmesg output to see if any errors happen
[07:32] <dr_willis> chiques:  or that  similer idea phone  that came out a year or so ago.. atrix?
[07:34] <andu> cm
[07:37] <Shadekitty> Can anyone tell me if Ubuntu 12.10 is compatable with VMWare 3.14? I'm having some really odd issues with my GUI…   sometimes my desktop shows up, sometimes it doesn't…  I haven't played with linux since Slackware 3 and couldn't find anything regarding this issue in any of the docs I looked at...
[07:38] <dr_willis> unity may have issues if the 3d drivers are not working right
[07:38] <Shadekitty> thx.. at least that gives me a direction to look… :)
[07:38] <dr_willis> try lubuntu  if you dont really want the fancy unity desktop
[07:39] <dr_willis> the askubuntu.com site may also have some guides/info on 12.10 in vmware.
[07:39] <dr_willis> i only use vbox  these days
[07:39] <bono> or qemu
[07:39] <WanderingEnder> VMWare what, btw?
[07:39] <WanderingEnder> ESXi, VSphere, Player, Workstation?
[07:39] <Shadekitty> I'm just exploring it for now as a whole. Job offer coming up and they primarily use ubuntu… it's been a while since I've touched any *nix systems…
[07:39] <Shadekitty> VMWare workstation 3.14
[07:40] <WanderingEnder> Use VirtualBox. You're not running VMWare on big iron, so there's no reason to stick with it.
[07:40] <Shadekitty> I'll check it out…
[07:42] <dr_willis> *nix is too handy to not have around. ;)
[07:42] <Shadekitty> I got lazy with windows…
[07:43] <Shadekitty> I did tinker with RHE at a job a few years back, but nothing major. Like I said.. my last real experience was slackware 3 if that gives you a timeframe…
[07:44] <Shadekitty> probably around the same time that I was last found in an IRC channel too.. LOL
[07:46] <bnathan> hi dr willis, I did the dmesg and I see "eth0 identified chip RTL8168f/R8111." "lshw -c" showed a network card of "r8168b/8111b"
[07:47] <dr_willis> this is a wired or wireless  network card?
[07:47] <bnathan> wired network card
[07:48] <dr_willis> ifconfig shows an eth0 device then?
[07:48] <bnathan> no. only the loopback
[07:48] <dr_willis> try modprobing the module again and look at the end of dmesg output perhaps? it may give a clue
[07:49] <bnathan> ok. thanks
[07:50] <zg> hi i'm having an issue booting my system
[07:50] <zg> I'm getting the error /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 is not ready yet or not present
[07:51] <zg> when I type 'swapon -a' it says 'swapon: /dev/mapper/cryptswap1: start failed: No such file or directory
[07:52] <dr_willis> you are using an encrypted swap partition?
[07:52] <petergk> zg: it's a cryptswap problem....
[07:52] <petergk> or partition
[07:53] <zg> I enabled encrypt home directory
[07:53] <kesh-may> i have a question about using wine, is it possible for me to run a game (sims 3) using all of the expansion packs that have been purchased as well
[07:53] <dr_willis> kesh-may:  check the wine app database perhaps.
[07:53] <dr_willis> !appdb
[07:53] <ubottu> The Wine Application DB is a database of applications and help for !Windows programs that run under !WINE: http://appdb.winehq.org - Join #winehq for application help
[07:53] <petergk> zg cryptsetup remove cryptswap1
[07:54] <zg> "Device cryptswap1 is not active."
[07:54] <kesh-may> i know that i can play the sims on wine but will it allow me to use the expansion packs as well they are all on seperate disk
[07:54] <petergk> zg: you can edit some stuff in the /etc/crypttab?
[07:54] <RollinV2> anyway to automatically load a set theme + icon set? I'd like to make my own login sessions based on themes (minimal for work, fancy for home, etc)
[07:54] <bnathan> hi dr willis, I did a "modprobe -v r8168" and the module is not doing anything presently. the last message on dmesg was the discrepancy of the identified network card type
[07:55] <dr_willis> so the module seems confused about the card sounds like
[07:56] <bnathan> dr_willis: Is there anything I could do or I have to ask help from Realtek?
[07:57] <dr_willis> bnathan:  i doubt if they will care or help.  you could check the arch linux wiki if the ubuntu forums and askubuntu.com help fails. they may have some info about the card in their wiki pages
[07:57] <helmut_> hi
[07:57] <bnathan> ok. thanks a lot
[07:58] <dr_willis> bnathan:  id also test a 13.04 live cd - see if the newer kernel in it works with the card.
[07:58] <warm> hi, I am connecting my laptop  via HDMI to a TV, and when i close the lid, the output stops. how to solve that?
[07:58] <bnathan> ah ok.
[07:58] <zg> petergk: yes
[07:58] <zg> cryptswap1 /dev/sda6 /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256
[07:58] <zg> that's the only line in the file
[07:59] <warm> I set the option in the power management to Do Nothing, but it won't help.
[08:00] <Shadekitty> check power management in your BIOS?
[08:01] <Shadekitty> I've got an older dell that I had to actually turn off stuff in bios rather than the OS to stop putting the laptop to sleep when the lid shut.
[08:02] <haracha> how do i modulate the brightness
[08:02] <haracha> i think a game set the brightness way too high
[08:03] <nunya> I'm trying to setup openvpn with wireless connection and I've followed the openvpn instructions to the letter but it keeps timing out and not working.
[08:03] <warm> Shadekitty, thanks, i'll try it out
[08:03] <Shadekitty> have you tried the blank screen setting rather than "do nothing"?
[08:03] <Shadekitty> a quick google shows that others have had the same problem in previous versions of ubuntu and have had the issue resolved changing the option..
[08:05] <Shadekitty> Seems to be a lot of Dell computers with the issue… happen to have a dell by chance?
[08:06] <warm> Shadekitty, no , there is no such an opting on my computer.
[08:08] <Shadekitty> Theres a lot of bugs reported similar to your issue… sorry I couldn't help. Try googling your specifics… if no one replies here
[08:08] <petergk> zg: comment out that line i think
[08:09] <warm> Shadekitty, that's ok, thank you, I searched, and led to an issue on ubuntu web, no common solution.
[08:09] <zg> i removed that line and it did nothing
[08:09] <skp1> !boot-repair
[08:09] <zg> also, I had an error with my installation
[08:10] <bnathan> Hi, will there be any problems if I update my linux kernel to the latest using ubuntu 12.10?
[08:11] <Shadekitty> @warm - maybe search for a fix editing /etc/acpi/lid.sh
[08:11] <zg> bnathan: from what version?
[08:12] <dr_willis> the latest kernel from kernel.org you mean? or what exactly
[08:12] <Shadekitty> or /etc/default/acpi-support
[08:13] <Kartagis> in cairo-dock, I've accidentally moved pidgin into firefox dock. how can I undo that?
[08:16] <bnathan> @dr_willis: yes, the latest kernel from kernel.org
[08:16] <bnathan> @dr_willis: I plan on using 3.7 or 3.8

[08:20] <infinity__> Just Curious I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 & using NFS, Which the system was working fine til lately, the NFS Server can't start due to portmap not starting to where I would have to ssh into server and start it manually, So I tried modifying /etc/init/portmap.conf and added start on runlevel [2345] or start-rpcbind. Has anyone ran into this problem before, Or is modifying that file the source of the probelm?
[08:20] <dr_willis> infinity__:  ubuntu dosent really use runlevles the same as other disrots do or did.
[08:21] <dr_willis> there may be some verbose options  to portmap to makeit log more error messages

[08:46] <voxcroix> osmrducks: can, but you need a complate download
[08:46] <osmrducks> yeah i dled the 764mb file from ubunto.com

[08:47] <dr_willis> halo4:    login:    is the  Console.
[08:47] <dr_willis> halo4:  so your system is booting and starting up.
[08:47] <halo4> im at the console

[08:47] <halo4> but i been waiting and it is not starting
[08:47] <chamunks> is there a way that I can get sudo access to files on a ubuntu target using winscp?
[08:47] <dr_willis> chamunks:  not any way that i know of.
[08:48] <chamunks> poo
[08:48] <halo4> what username
[08:48] <halo4> i dont know it
[08:48] <dr_willis> chamunks:  you could ssh in, and  then change permissions or setup a share - if you give us details
[08:48] <kgs> leonardpop: There is another solution, although is not very practical, you can put the sim card into a phone that supports USB Tethering & use it to connect.
[08:48] <chamunks> could I give a user root access then allow that in ssh?
[08:48] <dr_willis> halo4:  we dont know it either.. its the one you gave when you instgalled
[08:48] <dr_willis> chamunks:  direct logging in as root is disabled
[08:48] <chamunks> dr_willis, what sort of details do you need?
[08:49] <halo4> ok i did it and its still black secreend
[08:49] <chamunks> I mainly just want to edit apache configs via ssh
[08:49] <dr_willis> chamunks:  what are you trying to do that you need winscp to get in as root
[08:49] <chamunks> I need to set up virtual hosts
[08:49] <hexstatik> is it easy to install ubuntu on mac book pro(intel i7)?
[08:49] <dr_willis> chamunks:  ssh in, use a console editor and the shell to set things up..
[08:49] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: ssh in, sudo nano /etc7apache2/foo, done
[08:49] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: why would you use winscp to edit config-files?
[08:49] <chamunks> I could nano i was just hoping to use notepad ++
[08:49] <dr_willis> chamunks:  scp the files to the users account, then ssh in and move them where they need to go perhaps]
=== szx` is now known as szx
[08:50] <dr_willis> using windows text editors to edit linux config files - is not a good idea
[08:50] <chamunks> I was hoping for something a tad more elegant than moving files back n forth multiple times per save.
[08:50] <halo4> :.(
[08:50] <somsip> chamunks: if you're going to be doing any amount of admin work on a server, persevere with learning an editor that runs on the server
[08:50] <osmrducks> it says i am missing a pae kernel
[08:50] <osmrducks> ?
[08:50] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, I should have highlighted
[08:50] <dr_willis> you could use X forwarding feature of SSH to have the linux text editor show on the windows desktop also
[08:50] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: make sure you keep the unix lineendings of the config-files when you edit those in non-unix-systems.
[08:50] <chamunks> somsip, I know nano fine I just was hoping to use notepad++
[08:50] <halo4> just use vim
[08:51] <somsip> chamunks: like you said, that would be inelegant
[08:51] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, notepad++ usually takes care of configs pretty well its up there in funcionality with gedit
[08:51] <chamunks> I could just edit file permissions
[08:51] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: as vim does, so go the ssh way :)
[08:51] <halo4> so i cant fix my pc can i?
[08:51] <chamunks> I was mainly wondering if there was a good way to get sudo access.
[08:51] <osmrducks> ne other suggestions of linux other than ubuntu? and where to get them>

[08:52] <halo4> slackware
[08:52] <dr_willis> halo4:  how do you not know your user name?
[08:52] <chamunks> i just like nano for it keeps me well spoonfed with showing me the shortcuts.
[08:52] <halo4> i did the username
[08:52] <halo4> and my password
[08:52] <somsip> chamunks: then open the file in sudo nano, and copy past from notepad++
[08:52] <halo4> and its still at a black screen
[08:52] <dr_willis> halo4:  so you logged in?
[08:52] <defekt> osmrducks: distrowatch
[08:53] <halo4> no, the screen changed
[08:53] <chamunks> somsip, heh I suppose that could work sortof
[08:53] <dr_willis> changed how....
[08:53] <halo4> its still not working
[08:53] <chamunks> I
[08:53] <halo4> it has my pc name
[08:53] <osmrducks> defekt: if it wont load with vbox... will it load from disc?
[08:53] <halo4> and username
[08:53] <somsip> chamunks: not much more elegant, and I have no idea if you SSH client will support nice copy-paste
[08:53] <dr_willis> halo4:  so the answer is YES>. you have logged in..
[08:53] <halo4> i dont understand
[08:53] <chamunks> I'll add my main user to the group that is in the permissions list for the apache configs i suppose would work.
[08:54] <chamunks> I just wanted full system write access.
[08:54] <bentinata> halo4, did it show like "username@compname:"?
[08:54] <somsip> !root | chamunks
[08:54] <ubottu> chamunks: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[08:54] <halo4> thats what its doing
[08:54] <halo4> but i still cant log in
[08:54] <bentinata> you just logged in
[08:54] <ogist> hmm
[08:54] <somsip> chamunks: ditto for giving too many rights for any user
[08:54] <defekt> osmrducks: it's a website of linux distributions
[08:54] <bentinata> but not starting the XServer
[08:54] <halo4> im not dumb i know when i loged i
[08:54] <halo4> n
[08:55] <chamunks> somsip :P I know about sudo i've been with ubuntu for quite some time I just wish I could find a way to edit these files easier when im forced to use a windows environment.
[08:55] <bentinata> halo4, try type startx
[08:55] <somsip> chamunks: pick any of the 3 or 4 solutions already given <shrugs>
[08:55] <bentinata> halo4, "sudo startx", sorry
[08:55] <chamunks> my girlfriend likes playing games with me so I have to stick with windows for the games we play :(
[08:55] <dr_willis> no need to use sudo with startx
[08:55] <halo4> hmm
[08:55] <bentinata> dr_willis, thanks
[08:56] <chamunks> somsip, i'm satisfied with the response that essentially my solution wont work and that there are other options :)
[08:56] <halo4> this is command prompt?
[08:56] <chamunks> thanks for the attention to the matter all.
[08:56] <somsip> chamunks: colinux, cygnix, wubi, dual-boot, ubuntu only. That was my way
[08:56] <osmrducks> defekt: right but i just dled ubuntu and tryed to run it with vbox and it said i needed a pae kernel?... will it say the same thing if i burnt it to a disc and tryed to run it?
[08:56] <dr_willis> halo4:  you are at the bash shell.. yes
[08:56] <bentinata> halo4, that is shell
[08:56] <halo4> whats shell
[08:56] <osmrducks> or maybe i am not using vbox correctly
[08:56] <halo4> and whats bash
[08:56] <chamunks> somsip, I have a ssd with ubuntustudio and a hdd with windows 7 and I swap the sata cables I hate dualbooting.
[08:56] <halo4> new to unix
[08:56] <dr_willis> halo4:  you want to go spend an hr or 2 reading up on using bash  if you want to learn the basics
[08:56] <chamunks> windows breaks mbr's and I hate fixing grub
[08:56] <bentinata> halo4, it's like, command prompt on windows, but running on background
[08:57] <somsip> chamunks: sounds inelegant. Anyway, it's all up to you
[08:57] <MoL0ToV> <dr_willis> MoL0ToV:  theres some fuse tools  that can scan/show shares   but im not sure how well it works these days
[08:57] <chamunks> its not pretty but its easier than dualbooting problems and she only visits occasionally.
[08:57] <halo4> so that means the interface is broken yes?
[08:57] <MoL0ToV> dr_willis, what do you mean?
[08:57] <defekt> osmrducks: 2nd statement I'de say. What arch are you trying to install on vbox x86 or x64
[08:57] <bentinata> halo4, that what I want to say -__-
[08:57] <bentinata> halo4, you are logged in
[08:58] <bentinata> halo4, but without the xserver
[08:58] <halo4> but its not the same
[08:58] <osmrducks> umm... not quite sure i guess =/
[08:58] <chamunks> somsip, I just find whenever windows breaks I wind up leaving it forever if i do a dualboot if i do it this way im much less attatched to the filestructure so i just blow away wineblows and life goes on.
[08:58] <defekt> !gdm | halo4
[08:58] <osmrducks> im using win7 64bit
[08:58] <halo4> how to fix problem
[08:58] <dr_willis> halo4:  you were asked to run 'startx' to see if it works
[08:58] <bentinata> halo4, did the GUI show up?
[08:58] <halo4> negitory sir
[08:58] <chamunks> somsip, thanks have a good one :)
[08:59] <halo4> it still says not valid
[08:59] <bentinata> halo4, what it say?
[08:59]  * wdp doesn't know why people assume halo4 would be logged in correctly.
[08:59] <somsip> chamunks: np
[08:59] <dr_willis> halo4:  be more verbose in what its saying.. we are not mind readers'
[08:59] <ogist> halo4: what did you do
[08:59] <ogist> did you install the wrong video drivers?
[08:59] <halo4> it say not vaid command
[08:59] <defekt> osmrducks: download the ubuntu i386 iso file and use that to istall your vm
[08:59] <halo4> so this is command prompt like windows

[09:00] <halo4> startx
[09:00] <halo4> starx sudo
[09:00] <ogist> hextstatik: you are coming along fast :)

[09:01] <ogist> yeah
[09:01] <dr_willis> halo4:  how about - > running the 'whoami' command and see what it says...
[09:01] <dr_willis> he said he had a LOGIN: prompt earlier
[09:01] <dr_willis> of coruse he also said his pc was not starting....

[09:09] <ogist> that is very good halo4
[09:09] <halo4> prossessor
[09:09] <ogist> why dont ya just reinstall ubuntu
[09:09] <ogist> :)
[09:10] <osmrducks> defekt: it says check sums r diff... so what do i do?
[09:10] <halo4> 16 gigabite prossessor is good
[09:10] <bentinata> It's feel good when you repair, without reinstall
[09:10] <defekt> mystblade9: your USB is blank with no partions you need to format it.
[09:10] <dr_willis> halo4:   you typed without quotes the command        echo $SHELL    and  echo $PATH and it said invalid command?
[09:10] <dr_willis> both times
[09:10] <halo4> yes sir
[09:11] <TakeItEZ> halo4: type "help", what is the first line you get
[09:11] <halo4> yes it dose nothing i cant login to the thing
[09:11] <defekt> osmrducks: redowload ubuntu, the version you have is currupted
[09:11] <dr_willis> halo4:  you ARE logged in
[09:11] <halo4> but..
[09:11] <mystblade9> defekt: Yes, but how? There's no /dev/sdc1, and this is the output fdisk gives me: http://pastie.org/private/j9z3lhspvnvsbdhzjutjbq
[09:11] <dr_willis> but what.. you keepo confuseing the issue
[09:11] <krzkrz> how do i remove this repo: http://ppa.launchpad.net/paullo612/unityshell-rotated/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources
[09:11] <bentinata> dr_willis become more mad, hehe
[09:11] <halo4> im not at the same time
[09:11] <halo4> confused :/
[09:12] <dr_willis> we said earlier you are logged into the shell
[09:12] <halo4> what is the shell mean
[09:12] <dr_willis> now either you are totally messing up every command. or you got a very very badly broken system
[09:12] <ogist> cat /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:12] <ogist> ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list
[09:12] <halo4> so i have a virus
[09:13] <dr_willis> halo4:  no onme has mentioned a virus
[09:13] <dr_willis> and last i looked.. there are no linux  viruses out in the wild.
[09:13] <bentinata> Is virus is really exist on Linux?
[09:13] <ogist> krzkrz: try this first sudo cp -p /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list_backup
[09:13] <halo4> i think it maebe a virus on my pc
[09:13] <mrosmrducks> defekt: the check sums r diff... ne suggestions?
[09:13] <eutheria> can you still get the alternative install cd for 12.10?
[09:13] <ogist> linux is like a mac
[09:13] <dr_willis> halo4:  if you think so.. safest thing is to reinstall..
[09:14] <defekt> mystblade9: sorry can't check pastbin atm. did you try 'sudo cfdisk /dev/sdc'
[09:14] <TakeItEZ> eutheria: no, they stopped the alternate-cd, use mini.iso or desktop
[09:14] <halo4> i dont know anything about that kind of thing
[09:14] <dr_willis> i  am very confident you dont have a virus on a linux install
[09:14] <defekt> mrosmrducks: redowload ubuntu, the version you have is currupted
[09:14] <ogist> hey
[09:14] <eutheria> TakeItEZ, can you still create an encrypted partition using ?mini?
[09:14] <ogist> krzkrz
[09:15] <krzkrz> ogist, i dont see  http://ppa.launchpad.net/paullo612/unityshell-rotated/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources anywhere
[09:15] <TakeItEZ> eutheria: i don't know
[09:15] <ogist> krzkrz: do this ->   gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[09:15] <ogist> delete the line of code that has it
[09:15] <mrosmrducks> ok will try
[09:15] <ogist> and then type sudo apt-get update
[09:15] <mystblade9> defekt:  FATAL ERROR: Bad primary partition 1: Partition begins after end-of-disk
[09:17] <WanderingEnder> Anyone know which is less taxing on system resources? lubuntu or xubuntu. Thinking of deploying either on a 1 core 2 GB Azure VM.
[09:17] <ogist> WanderingEnder, lubuntu is
[09:17] <WanderingEnder> ty
[09:17] <ogist> but you can probably rub ubuntu on it
[09:17] <defekt> mystblade9: are you getting any dmesg errors when you plug the stick in?
[09:17] <ogist> and switch to fxce
[09:18] <chamunks> I have domainA.com domainB.com and domainC.com and they are all being routed through cloudflare at my ULAMP and I am reading mention of needing to edit the hosts file from this apache documentation http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/examples.html
[09:18] <ogist> you can run ubuntu and switch out unity with XFCE runs much faster and it’s interface stays out of your way allowing you more screen real estate for activities like programming and browsing.
[09:18] <chamunks> How would I accomplish this hosts file edit.
[09:18] <chamunks> ./etc/hosts yes?
[09:18] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: /etc/hosts, no leading .
[09:18] <chamunks> but is there some kind of syntax that I need to use to point things in different direction
=== Mitos-Daniel is now known as Rullish
[09:19] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, yes i just added the leading . so irc didnt catch it as a cmd
[09:19] <dr_willis> chamunks:  full paths dont start with a ./ that woul d be a relative path ;)
[09:19] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: use a space, its not misleading
[09:19] <blue112> Hello here.
[09:19] <dr_willis>           // i just put spaces here
[09:19] <tsimpson> chamunks: you don't need to edit /etc/hosts for apache, only if you want to test locally without DNS
[09:19] <eutheria> TakeItEZ, sorry i am being stupid, where do you get mini .iso from?
[09:20] <TakeItEZ> !mini | eutheria
[09:20] <ubottu> eutheria: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[09:20] <chamunks> well anyways the leading . aside :P
[09:20] <blue112> Since last reboot, gnome-shell won't launch anymore, it segfault just after login. What can I do to fix that ? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 x64.
[09:20] <bentinata> Hello blue112
[09:20] <eutheria> thank you TakeItEZ :)
[09:20] <mystblade9> defekt: Nevermind, found a solution. Am now overwriting the drive with zeros.
[09:20] <halo4> can anyone help me with my shell
[09:20] <bentinata> halo4, reinstall
[09:20] <chamunks> tsimpson, thanks that makes sense well I dont really see any specific benefits of testing locally really afaik
[09:20] <Kartagis> in cairo-dock, I've accidentally moved pidgin into firefox dock. how can I undo that?
[09:20] <secretbutter> halo4 no its broken
[09:21] <eutheria> next question, so deja-dup created me a very broken backup
[09:21] <eutheria> i want something that isn't going to create me a broken backup
[09:21] <dr_willis> halo4:  does       cd /bin/                seem to work or does it give an error?
[09:21] <halo4> if i reinstal i might lose my data
[09:21] <TakeItEZ> eutheria: rsnapshot is one tool
[09:21] <dr_willis> halo4:  you can use a live cd to access the data and back stuff up
[09:21] <bentinata> you can backup using console
[09:21] <hexstatik> is it easy to install ubuntu on mac book pro(intel i7)?
[09:22] <eutheria> TakeItEZ, command line?
[09:22] <blue112> Anyone ?
=== qos is now known as qos|away
=== carlos is now known as Guest48950
[09:22] <secretbutter> halo4 no you cant, its lost. forever
[09:22] <hexstatik> are there all the drivers available or any other issues?
[09:22] <TakeItEZ> eutheria: sure
[09:22] <bentinata> dr_willis suggestion is the easiest way
[09:22] <halo4> all my musics
[09:22] <dr_willis> halo4:  does       cd /bin/                seem to work or does it give an error?
[09:22] <chamunks> tsimpson, what would a line for the hosts file look like for domainA.com anyways?
[09:22] <eutheria> i was really after something like deja-dup
[09:22] <krzkrz> ogist, its not there repo: http://ppa.launchpad.net/paullo612/unityshell-rotated/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/source/Sources
=== qos|away is now known as qos
[09:22] <bentinata> eutheria, u1
[09:22] <eutheria> maybe something that can do a network backup
[09:23] <eutheria> u1?
[09:23] <bentinata> ubuntu one
[09:23] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: 127.0.1.1 domaina.com
[09:23] <chamunks> ok fair enough thanks TakeItEZ
[09:23] <eutheria> sadly i can't use ubuntu one,
[09:23] <halo4> it still says not valid command or oporateve file
[09:23] <tsimpson> chamunks: you'd just add domainA.com to the end of the existing line starting with 127.0.0.1, eg: "127.0.0.1 localhost domainA.com domainB.com domainC.com"
[09:24] <dr_willis> halo4:  so the command 'cd' even fails?        just cd, no quotes or anything special
[09:24] <bentinata> halo4, did you have camera?
[09:24] <blue112> Anyone knows how can I start a terminal to try debug my problem with gnome-shell crashed ?
[09:24] <eutheria> maybe i can if i could put an encrypted blob
[09:24] <chamunks> tsimpson, its wierd because the hosts file generated has a separate line for localhost and the machine name
[09:24] <halo4> what is batch
[09:24] <bentinata> halo4, take a picture of your monitor, and give it here
[09:24] <chamunks> http://puu.sh/1MlR0
[09:24] <chamunks> tsimpson, ^
[09:25] <secretbutter> halo4 you are screwed lol
[09:25] <halo4> i havent got a camera handy
[09:25] <bentinata> secretbutter, it's not funny
[09:26] <bentinata> halo4, "help"
[09:26] <tsimpson> chamunks: you can give different domains different loopback IPs in the 127.0.0.0/8 range, so they can seem to have unique IPs
[09:26] <halo4> i need help
[09:26] <bentinata> halo4, try "help"
[09:26] <halo4> type it
[09:26] <bentinata> halo4, yes
[09:26] <dr_willis> cd is a bash  and sh built in command i thought.. if its failing hes got some deep issues
[09:27] <chamunks> tsimpson, I didnt notice there was a difference heh sorry well thats good and interesting then I can take the different IP's and then route those in the apache section of this task.
[09:27] <halo4> is not valid
[09:27] <bentinata> very deep, dude
[09:27] <chamunks> tsimpson, if im having trouble with routing i suppose :S
[09:27] <blue112> Since last reboot, gnome-shell won't launch anymore, it segfault just after login. What can I do to fix that ? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 x64.
[09:27] <defekt> no busybox o.O
[09:27] <halo4> help is not a valid command or oporatevable batch file
[09:27] <bentinata> halo4, try restarting, it usually works :)
[09:28] <halo4> i did re start my pc
[09:28] <tsimpson> "not a valid command or batch file" seems very much like the error you get from cmd.exe on windows
[09:28] <halo4> i cant login, and by log in i mean use it after i log in
[09:28] <dr_willis> halo4:  so what does your prompt look like exactly?     yoruusername@yourcomputername:       ?
[09:28] <halo4> no not exactly
[09:29] <halo4> but kinda prompt
[09:29] <vtghii> hi, Gnome shell is cp hog with FGLRX installed, how to fix this problem, I have an ati card, enough ram and processor, it's only with fglrx that GS use 50%cpu

[09:30] <tsimpson> odyssey4me: you file a bug on launchpad requesting the backport
[09:30] <krzkrz> i get http://pastie.org/5666815 every time i do sudo apt-get update
[09:30] <dr_willis> halo4:  does  'dir' give any output?
[09:31] <halo4> hey its valid one
[09:31] <odyssey4me> thx tsimpson
[09:31] <bentinata> blue112, what did show to your screen?
[09:31] <dr_willis> and  the output  is?
[09:31] <halo4> its a lot of stuff
[09:31] <halo4> all my files
[09:31] <vtghii> I have installed fglrx drivers via jockey succesfully, then gnome shell is cpu hog, like 50%, the more I use it the more it's cpu hog, don'kt know what to do with the link :(
[09:31] <blue112> bentinata, IRC shows (XChat), because I launch it at startup
[09:32] <bentinata> dr_willis, halo4 is kicked to grub-shell
[09:32] <blue112> bentinata, it has no window decoration. Nothing else shows.
[09:32] <blue112> Oh, yeah, apport shows two few reboot before, said gnome-shell segfaults.
[09:32] <dr_willis> bentinata:  he said he was at LOGIN: earlier.. and that dosent look like a grub prompt to me
[09:32] <krzkrz> anyone?
[09:33] <bentinata> dr_willis, halo4 is forced to grub-shell
[09:33] <dr_willis> bentinata:  im thinking hes at the windows shell ;)
[09:33] <blue112> krzkrz, you got a ppa which is either not compatible with your distribution, or either dead. You should remove it.
[09:33] <halo4> it says contacts desktop documents downloas musics roms potos porn scriipts searches videos
[09:33] <krzkrz> blue112, how do i remove it
[09:33] <blue112> krzkrz, you can find its file at /etc/apt/source.list.d/
[09:33] <blue112> You just have to remove it.
[09:34] <TakeItEZ> i smell a troll
[09:34]  * dr_willis is about ready to clock out from work also.
[09:34] <vtghii> what is the version of fglrx on ubuntu 12.04?
[09:34] <halo4> so my files are not gone
[09:34] <krzkrz> blue112, then just do an rm?
[09:35] <halo4> i just cant log in
[09:35] <blue112> krzkrz, yep, just rm the problematic file in that folder, and apt shouldn't make any noise anymore.
[09:35] <bentinata> blue112, can you open terminal?
[09:35] <blue112> bentinata, I don't think so. I can go to tty1, but I can't have a virtual terminal.
[09:35] <blue112> I can open firefox with clicking a link on this channel :p
[09:36] <poq> Is any software to change memory values for ubuntu such ArtMoney and CheatEngine under win?
[09:36] <krzkrz> thanks blue112
[09:36] <halo4> so i keep my files with re install
[09:36] <halo4> live dise
[09:36] <MoL0ToV> exist a possible to configure ubuntu to automagically place in /media all the smb shares of the local net? as usb sticks and cdrom...
[09:36] <bentinata> halo4, live disc first, then reinstall
[09:37] <blue112> poq, you can access memory at /dev/memory. There's a high probability you crash everything if you don't know what you're doing, though.
[09:37] <halo4> how long should it take
[09:37] <bentinata> blue112, how can you open firefox with xchat? cool!
[09:37] <kepler> cat /dev/urandom > /dev/memory  !!
[09:37] <dr_willis> halo4:  how do we know how many files you have...
[09:37] <blue112> bentinata, yeah but it won't handle focus anymore, so I have to close firefox to go back to xchat :/
[09:38] <halo4> its mostly music
[09:38] <kepler> blue112, you can try to alt+click and move windows around
[09:38] <dr_willis> halo4:  it takes as long as it takes... we dont know how many GB of files you have..
[09:38] <halo4> i have a 16 gb prossesor
[09:38] <bentinata> blue112, "gnome-shell replace"
[09:39] <TakeItEZ> you don't halo4
[09:39] <blue112> kepler, it doesn't work. I can move window by handling then at the menu bar. But focus isn't working, I won't be able to speak here if firefox is open
[09:39] <halo4> it says so in the sticer
[09:39]  * dr_willis has a 8core toaster oven
[09:39] <blue112> bentinata, it complains about not being able to open X11 display (even with export DISPLAY=:0)

[09:43] <radium> i'm getting sick of slow speed , please someone guide me if it is a gud idea to use google dns or open dns? i'm  using ubuntu 12.04
[09:43] <blue112> vtghii, I'm not sure, with an ATI card, I'm using an Nvidia.
[09:43] <kepler> vtghii, try sudo amdcccle

[09:43] <WanderingEnder> !hi | m3pow
[09:44] <m3pow> hello !
[09:44] <kepler> it should pop open the control panel for the ati card
[09:44] <blue112> radium, sure, you can use google dns by going into the NetworkManager, and replace the DNS line with 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
[09:44] <dr_willis> radium:  a great many people use both
[09:44] <ph1rmw4r3> okay
[09:44] <m3pow> is there any reason why disk access in Ubuntu 12.10 is that slow. I am running it on an HDX 18
[09:44] <vtghii> kepler, I did it, I have amd conotrol center open
[09:44] <radium> dr_willis: both at same time? rite?
[09:44] <m3pow> i've used 12.04 before and there things seemed to be OK. everything was fast
[09:44] <ph1rmw4r3> well im going to go to bed while i reinstall ubuntu
[09:44] <ph1rmw4r3> ill talk to you later dr willis
[09:44] <dr_willis> radium:  you could if you wanted  i guess
[09:44] <blue112> Since last reboot, gnome-shell won't launch anymore, it segfault just after login. What can I do to fix that ? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 x64.
[09:44] <kepler> if you pop on information, does it populate correctly?
[09:45] <dr_willis> i dont see much point in using opendns if you are using googles
[09:45] <radium> Blue112: thanks, but i know that  , my main ques is that . is it really fast to use open dns?
[09:45] <vedarthk> I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on Lenevo U410 which has Nvidia Graphics card, how do I install nvidia drivers ?
[09:45] <m3pow> it is pretty annoying to have a slow experience in Ubuntu
[09:45] <ogist> I like this linux
[09:45] <ph1rmw4r3> goodnight dr_willis
[09:46] <ogist> it is like a macbook
[09:46] <blue112> radium, what is slow exactly ? Is your DNS resolution is slow ?
[09:46] <radium> and one more ques.. how to scroll up .. bcoz there is no scroll bar.. i'm using xchat
[09:46] <radium> blue112: yeah .. very slow
[09:46] <ogist> page up
[09:46] <blue112> radium, then yes, it should speed things up.
[09:46] <radium> local isp isn't really that fast as i thought
[09:46] <ogist> open dns?
[09:46] <radium> ogist thanks :)
[09:46] <blue112> radium, you can try other dns resolution speed by using host command
[09:47] <blue112> host host_to_resolve dns_to_use
[09:47] <radium> blue112: lemme try this .  btw  thanks :)
[09:47] <blue112> No problem.
[09:48] <blue112> Any clue about my gnome-shell bug ?
[09:48] <blue112> [or any channel I can ask for help ?]

[09:48] <blue112> Since last reboot, gnome-shell won't launch anymore, it segfault just after login.
[09:49] <radium> did u check ur bash profile?
[09:49] <blue112> what about it ?
[09:49] <MonkWitDaFunk> blue112. does your bug make your system.freeze shirtly after booting?
[09:50] <blue112> MonkWitDaFunk, nop, it's not freezing, I'm currently using it. XChat autostarts after startup. It's just I have no window decorator and no gnome-shell top-bar.
[09:50] <radium> for any bad alias? or it maybe corrupted ..any bad configuration
[09:51] <vedarthk> hi, I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 on Lenevo U410 which has Nvidia Graphics card, how do I install nvidia drivers ?
[09:51] <blue112> radium, hm, I haven't changed anything in it since last reboot, unfortunately.
[09:51] <blue112> vedarthk, you can download them on the NVidia website, directly.
[09:51] <dr_willis> vedarthk:  package name is  nvidia-current in the repos
[09:51] <blue112> Or use the repository, yes.
[09:51] <dr_willis> vedarthk:  dont use the ones from the nvidia site if you can avoid it

[09:53] <blue112> !nvidia | blue112
[09:53] <ubottu> blue112, please see my private message
[09:53] <svneo> hi, i'm getting WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /home/user/.cache/keyring-GT4vfX/pkcs11: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type  every time i "svn up"; how can i solve that?
[09:53] <dr_willis> dident even see them sttate an issue, just asked how to install the nvida drivers
[09:54] <MonkWitDaFunk> righy
[09:54] <dr_willis> svneo:  its just a warning.. are you saying the command is failing?
[09:54] <MonkWitDaFunk> right*
[09:55] <MonkWitDaFunk> eit
[09:55] <svneo> dr_willis: no it's working fine
[09:55] <svneo> dr_willis: but if possible i'd like to avoid the warning
[09:55] <MonkWitDaFunk> sorry about my text ppl
[09:56] <radium> could someone please tell me where to find host file? in ubuntu 12.04?
[09:56] <TakeItEZ> radium:  /etc/hosts
[09:56] <NuSuey> is there a way to be notified when the new ati drivers are out? no rss/newsletter?articles somewhere?
[09:56] <radium> TakeItEZ : thank you :)
[09:56] <chamunks> Ive got an error restarting apache http://puu.sh/1MmaW make_sock:could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80 which strikes me as an odd thing to say
[09:57] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: sudo lsof -i :80                  anything listening/blocking the port?
[09:57] <chamunks> apparently i needed to remember to sudo but now im getting could not

[09:57] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, I fudged a silly and didnt sudo
[09:58] <JornStian> how can I figure out why the package have been dropped?
[09:58] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, http://puu.sh/1MmbN this is the echo
[10:00] <TomyLaptop> can "kdesudo -u otheruser /home/otheruser/one_of_his_programs" harm me?
[10:02] <Grievre> Hey um... so the ubuntu article on creating bootable USB sticks doesn't tell you how to do it from non-ubuntu distributions
[10:02] <Grievre> only ubuntu, windows and mac os
[10:04] <extropy> so I moved a boot disk from one computer to another, didn't work, moved it back to original, now it won't boot
[10:04] <dr_willis> hmm,, seems displaylink monitors (and the company)  have a bit of a history with  poor linux support
[10:05] <extropy> any particular reason why ubuntu installation CDs don't have some sort of "repair boot manager" option?
[10:05] <dr_willis> Grievre:  the pendrivelinux site should have tools for several disrtos... or you can 'dd' the iso file to the  usb from most any linux disrto
[10:05] <Grievre> dr_willis: Okay, does that work?
[10:05] <extropy> serious, what's with all this fancy schmancy "EUFI" crap? seems to be just getting in my way. What can't I just set a damn boot flag and be done with it?
[10:06] <dr_willis> extropy:  there is a boot-repair livce cd you can get.  its 32 and 64bit compatiable
[10:06] <dr_willis> Grievre:  dd? should work its the simpleist way
[10:06] <extropy> dr_willis I shouldn't be needing to repair anything to begin with.
[10:06] <TakeItEZ> Grievre: cat/dd works, if the iso is an hybrid-iso (as most actual linux-iso are)
[10:06] <JornStian> dr_willis: does that mean that canonical dropped the package because it was unstable?
[10:06] <dr_willis> extropy:  you asked a question. i answered... so whatever
[10:06] <Grievre> okay but are the ubuntu ISOs like that
[10:06] <extropy> I never did anything (intentionally) to invalidate my SSD's boot-worthiness
[10:07] <dr_willis> JornStian:  from what im reading at askubuntu.com theres a bit of a  history of poor support.
[10:07] <extropy> dr_willis: why should I need an entire LiveCD just to set a damn boot flag? who the hell decided Ubuntu should be so freaking complicated?
[10:07] <dr_willis> JornStian:  and i was wanting to get one of those things
[10:07] <dr_willis> extropy:   this is a support channel. not a ranting channel.
[10:08] <TakeItEZ> Grievre: they are
[10:08] <Grievre> extropy: What do you mean "why should I need an entire livecd just to set a boot flag", you need an OS to boot into before you can do anything
[10:08] <dr_willis> Grievre:  the ability to dd the iso  straight to flash  has only worked with the latest 2-3 releases of ubuntu i belive.
[10:08] <extropy> Grievre: Ubuntu's default livecd should be sufficient. I'm not suggesting, I'm insisting.
[10:08] <bentinata> anyone?
[10:09] <JornStian> dr_willis: well... for now you can hold that purchase.. it's not close to working :|
[10:09] <bentinata> someone notice me?
[10:09] <dr_willis> JornStian:  yep. was wanting one for my RaspberryPi
[10:09] <Grievre> extropy: oh you can't do it with the default livecd? I would have thought you should be able to
[10:09] <extropy> Grievre: seems like a no-brainer to me, just sayin'
[10:10] <Grievre> I'm unfamiliar with UEFI, what's the issue here?
[10:10] <TakeItEZ> extropy: why shouldn't you be able to set a boot-flag on a partition with the standard-live-cd?
[10:10] <dr_willis> You can install boot-repair with the live cd. (to ram)
[10:10] <dr_willis> you can set flags with cfdisk or parted i imagine
[10:10] <extropy> TakeItEZ: that is a great, questions: something something ext4
[10:10] <qwiksilver711_> anyone here familiar with getting 12.04 functional on an alienware m14x?
[10:11] <TakeItEZ> extropy: "man parted"
[10:11] <extropy> dr_willis: that would be the advice I'm looking for
[10:11] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, do you think I can define two ServerName's in sites-available/siteA like ServerName siteA.com then Servername www.siteA.com
[10:11] <chamunks> would that work?
[10:11] <TakeItEZ> chamunks: idk, i don't deal with apache
[10:11] <MonkeyDust> !anyone | qwiksilver711_
[10:11] <ubottu> qwiksilver711_: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[10:12] <chamunks> TakeItEZ, fair enough
[10:12] <Grievre> extropy: what error are you getting when you try to boot?
[10:12] <extropy> TakeItEZ: parted has nothing to do with it ... otherwise I wouldn't be her. if is was just a matter of setting a boot flag I'd be done
[10:12] <extropy> "Reboot and Select propert Boot device"
[10:13] <extropy> EFI, ext4 and swap partitions all seem to be in good shape, no idea why it won't freaking boot
[10:13] <TakeItEZ> extropy: 11:07 < extropy> dr_willis: why should I need an entire LiveCD just to set a damn boot flag?  so what do you really want to do? please give info and stop your pointless rants
[10:13] <Grievre> dr_willis: should I dd onto the drive or onto a partition on the drive?
[10:13] <dr_willis> Grievre:  the drive  always the drive
[10:13] <Grievre> extropy: is your BIOS configured right?
[10:13] <extropy> TakaItEZ: I'm over simplifying there. I *should* just be able to set a boot flag, problem solved. The fact is I can't.
[10:13] <dr_willis> Grievre:  and DONT get the wrong drive. ;)(
[10:14] <gsommer> I've created a patch for a dep package (paps) - I wouln't mind giving it back to the community (either as .patch, or as dep package)... I just can't figure out who to contact - and how to do this? :/
[10:15] <agsel> I disable some shortcuts from keyboard settings, but they still work
[10:15] <extropy> how about someone just brief me on what Ubuntu is doing these days for their bootmanager. I can tell somethings new.
[10:15] <guest16> IIRC the UEFI system partition (the boot partition) must be a FAT
[10:15] <guest16> not ext...
[10:16] <extropy> when did Ubuntu move to this UEFI thing? its somehow convinced itself that my JumpDrive is a bootable partition and nothing else
[10:17] <MonkeyDust> extropy  it didnt, it was forced to follow
[10:17] <dr_willis> computers are moveing to using UEFI
[10:17] <dr_willis> if i have a flash drive set up correctly ive noticed the bios shows it as a uefi disk
[10:17] <dr_willis> some times it shows it as both a uefi disk and a non uefi disk
[10:17] <dr_willis> and i could boot it either way
[10:18] <MonkeyDust> extropy  UEFI replaces BIOS, it has nothing to do with Ubuntu
[10:18] <extropy> dr_willis: mine seems to have taken over, asserting that it's USB Flash drive is my *only* boot partition.
[10:19] <extropy> guess I don't see how any of this stuff is necessary
[10:19] <chamunks> Do i need to run a2ensite every time I edit files in /etc/apache2/sites-available/?
[10:20] <extropy> Extensible Firmware: as in ... the world's slickest hardware backdoor?
[10:21] <dr_willis> its what exists.. so it really dosent matter
[10:21] <qwiksilver711_> does the iso download set up the dual boot loader on its own?
=== john__ is now known as __j0hn__
[10:21] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  what iso download?
[10:21] <extropy> why do I get the feeling like I have to boot from my disk to get my computer to boot from my disk?
[10:21] <qwiksilver711_> just the 12.04 one
[10:21] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  a normal install should set up grub to dual boot a  system
[10:21] <qwiksilver711_> i was going to install it in the morning
[10:22] <qwiksilver711_> as long as its not going to trash things
[10:22] <qwiksilver711_> i tried with 10.4 and it was rough for me
[10:22] <extropy> "oh hey, we *can* boot from your SSD ... we'll just do that by default from now on, sorry for the inconvenience. Any idea how it got like this to begin with?"
[10:22] <dijit> Hallo
[10:23] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis thank you for the answer
[10:23] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  make backups
[10:23] <dr_willis> always have backups
[10:24] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis: of course, already have the drive imaged to my nas
[10:24] <extropy> incidentally I have no use for a "boot repair" livecd seeing as how I don't have a cdrom, or any flash drives available not that I'm even going to bother assuming thats an option ...
[10:24] <dijit> Ok, I've googled extensively
[10:24] <extropy> this should really be a one-line thing I can do from Ubuntu's live cd "sudo fixmydisk" ...
[10:25] <dijit> so I'm hoping someone by chance sees this.
[10:25] <TakeItEZ> extropy: try switching your computer to bios-boot and stop your pointless rants here
[10:25] <dijit> I have a server (Ubuntu 10.04 LTS)
[10:25] <dijit> which will not boot.
[10:25] <dijit> it drops to busy box with the line "could not find /dev/mapper/<servername>-root
[10:26] <dijit> however, not only does the block device exist, it's mountable
[10:26] <dr_willis> dijit:  you ae using lvm? or raid?
[10:26] <dijit> both.
[10:26] <dijit> raid1 (hardware)
[10:26] <dijit> and lvm.
[10:26] <svneo> hi, i'm getting WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /home/user/.cache/keyring-GT4vfX/pkcs11: No such file or directory  every time i "svn up"; how can i solve this warning?
[10:27] <extropy> TakeItEZ: care to elaborate or should I just continue ranting instead?
[10:27] <TakeItEZ> extropy: what part you don't understand?
[10:28] <extropy> the entire part
[10:28] <extropy> starting when you wrote something
[10:28] <extropy> set my computer to bios-boot ... is that supposed to mean something to me at all?
[10:28] <qwiksilver711_> extropy: I think TakeItEZ meant to suggest you set the boot option in the bios to the HDD
[10:28] <qwiksilver711_> or SDD
[10:28] <qwiksilver711_> SSD* sorry
[10:29] <extropy> qwiksilver711_ thanks, it's amazing what a little clarity can achieve.
[10:29] <dijit> dr_willis; I assumed it was taking too long to pvscan so I set rootdelay=60
[10:29] <qwiksilver711_> extropy no problem
[10:29] <dijit> which also does not work.
[10:29] <dr_willis> dijit:  i never use raid or lvm. so ive got no real suggestions
[10:29] <dijit> balls. cheers anyway.
[10:30] <MonkeyDust> dijit  try in #ubuntu-server
[10:30] <ogist> ubuntu server
[10:30] <ogist> heh
[10:31] <Grievre> I don't know why the word "webinar" makes me so irrationally angry
[10:32] <qwiksilver711_> are the new versions of ubuntu more friendly with laptops running nvidia optimus?
[10:32] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  its still a work in progress
[10:32] <kepler> qwiksilver711_, nothing linux is friendly with optimus (yet)
[10:32] <extropy> I see bios_grub in Gparted, is that what I want?
[10:32] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis the thing that turned me off when i used 10.04 was that i couldnt force the nvidia off
[10:32] <qwiksilver711_> extropy no
[10:32] <extropy> no "bios-boot", should I be using something else?
[10:32] <MonkeyDust> qwiksilver711_  nvidia is to blame for that
[10:33] <qwiksilver711_> extropy its like the actual bios options
[10:33] <qwiksilver711_> extropy nothing to do with gparted, its the screeen that comes up withen you first boot, and you hit like f2 to get into it
[10:33] <qwiksilver711_> extrop should have an option there to change the boot priority list
[10:34] <qwiksilver711_> so, even if ubuntu forces both my graphics cards to run i'm still going to do it this time
[10:34] <qwiksilver711_> if i have a 13 button mouse is it possible to use something to map those buttons to something?
[10:34] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  should be possible
[10:35] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  ive seen some well done arch linux wiki pages for some specific mice
[10:35] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis i poked around for that a bit tonight, but was unable to find anything for my mouse, its not a super common make
[10:35] <extropy> call me crazy but I think this EUFI thing is just a slippery slope to hardware backdoors and Chernobyl-virus like hardware bricking down the road /rant
[10:36] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  the gernal guides may show what commands/tools they use
[10:36] <jpds> extropy: Have you been to Chernobyl?
[10:36] <extropy> no but I've had doesn't of systems wiped by WinCH
[10:36] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis i read something about something called xorg?
[10:36] <extropy> *dozens
[10:36] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  thats  the X server.
[10:36] <arkonten> can any one explain why Ubuntu Software Center's search can't find the samtools package when I search for 'samtools'? I can find it in aptitude and the various cmd line apt tools without issue
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[10:37] <extropy> Ubuntu Software Center != debians own repos, I believe ...
[10:37] <dr_willis> arkonten:  theres some 'advanced/command line/other' filters at the bottom i recall
[10:37] <MonkeyDust> extropy  maybe you should read some background information about UEFI, what it is, why it's there etc
[10:37] <dr_willis> i never use software center
[10:37] <JornStian> extropy: I for one, welcome UEFI.. getting rid of legacy AT-support and whatnot will bring us forward loads
[10:37] <dr_willis> MonkeyDust:  dont confuse things with facts!
[10:38] <extropy> MonkeyDust maybe I'm already doing that and it doesn't seem all that necessary
[10:38] <arkonten> dr_willis: I've seen that for other queries, but I get nothing for samtools.
[10:39] <qwiksilver711_> is it better to run 32 or 64 bit?
[10:40] <MonkeyDust> qwiksilver711_  64bit on 64bit hardware
[10:40] <dr_willis> i use 64bit os on allmy 64bit hardware
[10:40] <TakeItEZ> qwiksilver711_: if your cpu supports 64bit, there is no reason to use 32bit
[10:40] <qwiksilver711_> i thought so, my cpu will support it
[10:41] <extropy> for being so fancy, new and allegedly useful, it sure seems to be doing nothing for me besides get in my way
[10:41] <dr_willis> take it to #ubuntu-offtioic
[10:41] <qwiksilver711_> minecraft works with 12.04 right?
[10:41] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  ive heard it does
[10:42] <qwiksilver711_> hooray
[10:42] <extropy> on EUFI: " It does not solve any of the BIOS's long-standing problems of requiring two different drivers—one for the firmware and one for the operating system—for most hardware."
[10:42] <dr_willis> qwiksilver711_:  i think it needs the oracle java
[10:42] <dr_willis> extropy:  enough allready.. we dont care
[10:42] <TomyLaptop> can "kdesudo -u otheruser /home/otheruser/one_of_his_programs" harm me?
[10:42] <extropy> dr_willis: clearly, you don't. which is why I'll stop ranting when I feel like it.
[10:42] <qwiksilver711_> dr_willis thats fine, if it will run on something i'll figure out how to make it work
[10:43] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:  worse case it could affect your users home files yes.
[10:43] <MonkeyDust> extropy  no rants here, please
[10:43] <TomyLaptop> dr_willis, damn. can i prevent this?
[10:43] <extropy>  EFI [is] an attempt to remove the ability of the user to truly control the computer.
[10:44] <Tager> extropy: how so?
[10:44] <Grievre> extropy: It's primarily an attempt to replace the extremely outdated PC boot sequence with something more modern. Some people see it as what you describe, though
[10:44] <MonkeyDust> extropy  richard stallman uses his own custom BIOS, maybe you should contact him
[10:44] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:    that would be the worse case. if you are worried about it. log out and back in as the user in question. ive never really tried any exploits. so im not sure how su could come 'back' to your home. bu

[10:44] <extropy> MonkeyDust: I'll contact Theo DeRaadt first
[10:45] <TomyLaptop> dr_willis, how about kdesudo su otheruser -c ...
[10:45] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:  ive never heard of suing to a user being an issue. but   the user does have some rights to your X display and other stuff so its not totally isolated
[10:45] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:  that may just add more confusion and loopholes..
[10:45] <Grievre> Why is the default block size for dd so small
[10:45] <Grievre> like laughably small, to the point where it bottlenecks the transfer
[10:45] <dr_willis> Grievre:  because the source code is so old. ;)
[10:45] <TakeItEZ> Grievre: historical reasons i guess
[10:46] <dr_willis> Grievre:  ive heard some disrtos have dds block size bigger but never noticed
[10:46] <Tager> dr_willis: via an alias?
[10:46] <k3lt> Hey, i have a question

[10:48] <dr_willis> k3lt:  the lts version shouldent be asking to upgrade to non-lts unless youve checked the option in the software center/software sources setting
[10:48] <k3lt> ok, thanks

[10:53] <hell_> hi
[10:54] <extropy> I'm always in here with real-world problems that relate directly to ubuntu and I always get they snarky "take it to ubuntu-offtopic" crap ...
[10:54] <dr_willis> your ranting is the issue for it.
[10:54] <jrib> extropy: like what?  What you're saying now certainly isn't an ubuntu support question ;)
[10:54] <Serano> extropy well since ubuntu is the most beginner friendly distro, that shouldn't be surprising
[10:54] <extropy> I'm starting to think you guys are just intimidated by anyone even remotely knowledgeable ... and would prefere to interact only with noobs who will *never* ask any hard-hitting questions.
[10:55] <Serano> anyway it's nice to see the curiosity :)
[10:55] <jrib> extropy: seriously, let's stick to support.
[10:55] <extropy> do try

[11:02] <lotuspsychje> day: did you try playonlinux?
[11:02] <qwiksilver711_> does borderlands 2 run via wine?

[11:03] <qwiksilver711_> MonkeyDust thank you, sorry for being a n00b
[11:03] <Serano> i'm sorry can't recall exactly. It's been over 6 months I had it installed. I remember the problem was that you were not able to buy from the Riot store.
[11:03] <Serano> but besides that, the game runned fine for me
[11:04] <Serano> now with the new overhaul of their interface, i'm not sure if the problem still exists
[11:04] <mrosmrducks> is defekt still on here?
[11:04] <extropy> this is boring. I'm not going to accomplish anything here, what else is new?
[11:05] <Serano> i love my rasp :)
[11:06] <mrosmrducks> can someone help me... i dled the ubuntu 32bit and tryed running with vbox and had no luck... defekt suggested i re dl and still had no luck... i tryed the check sum app and it said they do not compare... ne suggestions?
[11:06] <ichat> can anyone help me figure out how to troubleshoot and  fix  some  hardware  / chipset / bios-efi  issues with my sandy bridge    b830  notebook,  it wont halt anymore  just reboots when its halted...
[11:06] <extropy> HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!
[11:06] <Serano> mrosmrducks try installing it with apt-get
[11:06] <extropy> ichat welcome to the club
[11:06] <mrosmrducks> but i want to try to run it first before i install it
[11:06] <Serano> it should download any dependencies
[11:07] <ichat> extropy:  - same problem?
[11:07] <extropy> oh yeah
[11:07] <extropy> EUFI is the devil
[11:07] <jpds> extropy: Can you stop the random bashing?
[11:07] <extropy> jpds: not until the problem is fixed
[11:07] <diverdude> TakeItEZ, that did not help
[11:07] <Serano> extropy i'm not familiar with uefi system, since i love my 980x but is it such a pain?
[11:08] <diverdude> TakeItEZ, it still dont mount
[11:08] <jrib> extropy: then I'm going to have to remove you.  Please just stick to support here.
[11:08] <Serano> was thinking of upgrading soon
[11:08] <extropy> jrib: i'm here for support. Ban dr_willis and MonkeyDust if you *actually* want to remove any trolls. Otherwise I have plenty of proxies I can use ...
[11:09] <ichat> extropy:  first it went fine,    BUT  my wifi module had problems  when it went hybernate...  so i added the    realtec driver to  some   file  so that it unloads   before hybernation...
[11:09] <ichat> after that  change   (but im not sure if its the cause)   i notices my system wouldn  halt anymore
[11:09] <arashmousavi> I have connected to my server via ssh and create a process , but suddenly my internet connection disconnected. I know that process going on, but how can restore previous session to see the progress of it?
[11:09] <ixio2> anyone fancy telling me how I can use find to find the first 2500 files in a directory and move them to another ?
[11:10] <jrib> ixio2: first in what order?
[11:10] <jpds> arashmousavi: Not unless you used something like screen or byobu.
[11:10] <bekks> arashmousavi: There is no session to be restored after the ssh session was broken.
[11:10] <ixio2> jrid I dont care really
[11:10] <sw> Hi, I have a user 'backups' trying to access a samba share \\ip\backups from a Windows machine but can't get authorized. It's using the correct password and is in write users for that share. root is too and that works.
[11:10] <Serano> arashmousavi try using the screen program to have multiple session where you can disconnect from and reattach to
[11:10] <diverdude> I tried adding this to my /etc/fstab curlftpfs#uname:pwd@host /media/mountpoint fuse rw,allow_other,noauto,user 0 0     and do sudo mount -a. But it does not seem to mount anything. Is that totally wrong to do?
[11:10] <sw> Any help?
[11:11] <ixio2> I just want to move 2500 files at a time
[11:11] <jrib> ixio2: why only 2500?  Anyway, check out xargs.
[11:12] <mrosmrducks> my ubuntu wont run... says i have no pae kernel... NE help?
[11:12] <arashmousavi> no way?
[11:12] <diverdude> anyone?
[11:12] <jrib> arashmousavi: well why don't you connect to the server again and see if the process is even running anymore?
[11:13] <ixio2> ok I can understand xargs.. but what about finding the first 2500 files
[11:13] <ichat> jpds:  any help maybe? -
[11:13] <jrib> ixio2: xargs lets you specify the number of arguments
[11:13] <jpds> ichat: find . -type f | head -n 2500
[11:14] <jrib> ixio2: so you can do 2500 at a time as you said
[11:14] <ichat> jpds:  what does that do?
[11:14] <arashmousavi> jrib: I know, but the process gives me some information(output) that is necessary.
[11:14] <jpds> ichat: Sorry, that was for ixio2.
[11:14] <jrib> arashmousavi: so is the answer yes or no?  Is the process still running?
[11:14] <ichat> ow ok
[11:15] <ixio2> find . -type f | head -n 2500 -exec mv '{}' /new/path \;  <-- like this ?
[11:15] <bekks> ixio2: No.
[11:15] <bekks> ixio2: find . -type f | head -n 2500 | xargs ...
[11:15] <arashmousavi> jrib: yes
[11:16] <mrosmrducks> should i try dling the 64bit ubuntu for my 64bit win7 instead of the 32bit? maybe that would solve the prob
[11:16] <jrib> arashmousavi: what is the process and how did you start it?
[11:16] <bekks> mrosmrducks: That wont help you.
[11:16] <ixio2> find . -type f | head -n 2500 | xargs mv /new/path
[11:16] <mrosmrducks> =/
[11:16] <ixio2> like that ?
[11:16] <mrosmrducks> ne suggestions?
[11:16] <jrib> ixio2: can you say why you want to move 2500 at a time and not more?
[11:17] <diverdude> anyone?
[11:17] <jrib> !anyone | diverdude
[11:17] <ubottu> diverdude: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[11:17] <ixio2> jrib when they reach their desination they are procesed by another script which gets upset with too many files
[11:17] <jrib> !helpme | diverdude
[11:17] <ubottu> diverdude: Avoid following your questions with a trail of "Please, help me", "Can nobody help me?", "I really need this!", and so on. This just contributes to making the channel unreadable. If you are not answered, ask again later; but see also !repeat and !attitude
[11:17] <bono> ixio2: find . -type f | head -n 2500 | xargs -i mv "{}" /new/path
[11:17] <ixio2> thanks everyone!
[11:18] <jrib> ixio2: I see.  I would still say avoiding head and using xargs is going to be easier for you to work with.  Otherwise, you're going to be back here in two minutes asking how to get the second set of 2500 files
[11:18] <ixio2> I presumed by moving the files I could just run the same command again?
[11:19] <jrib> ixio2: good point :)
[11:19] <ixio2> cool
[11:19] <superkuh> This is a long shot, but, has anyone else had a problem with ATI/AMD Radeon cards wherein you cannot play more than 4 videos at once, in any player with any rendering method? The 5th always only plays sound.
[11:19] <ixio2> superkuh all my ati related video.sound issues are always resolved by downloading the development release of the driver from the AMD website
=== challenger_ is now known as challenger
[11:20] <superkuh> Unfortunately my X server on Ubuntu 10.04 isn't compatible with the latest.
[11:20] <superkuh> I really wish I could.
[11:20] <bono> ixio2: problem: what if the filenames contain spaces .. normally one would use find .. -print0 | xargs -0 ..  but with head it wouldn't work
[11:20] <superkuh> Or, I wish I was wrong?
[11:20] <superkuh> Am I?
[11:21] <k3lt> So im now trying to install FGLRX ati drivers for my gfx (hd7850)
[11:21] <bono> ixio2: dunno if xargs -0 --max-lines 2500 works for this
[11:21] <k3lt> installed it and im getting "unsupported hardware" in my right screen corner
[11:21] <adamk> superkuh: Do you get any errors when you run the video player from a terminal window?
[11:21] <k3lt> what's that?
[11:22] <ixio2> bono the files will have lots of spaces
[11:22] <ixio2> its moved them though
[11:22] <bono> ixio2: the filenames too?
[11:23] <superkuh> ... as is often the case I have discovered it was user error only after complaining on IRC. With the gl renderer (which all my video players used) I hit that limit. If I switch to other renders which have horiztonal tearing I can go beyond 4.
[11:23] <ixio2> filenames yeah
[11:23] <diverdude> jrib, as i said,  I tried adding this to my /etc/fstab curlftpfs#uname:pwd@host /media/mountpoint fuse rw,allow_other,noauto,user 0 0     and do sudo mount -a. But it does not seem to mount anything. Is that totally wrong to do?
[11:23] <jrib> diverdude: I don't know.  I would have answered you if you did.  Just wanted to let you know that saying "anyone?" is not productive. Most people that just joined will have no idea what your question is.

[11:26] <Eagleman> How do i flush the dns cache in ubuntu/bind, dig is still resolving the wrong stuff
[11:29] <jrib> bono, ixio2: yes, if there are spaces in the names you should use -print0 with find and -0 with xargs.  You can still have head in between
[11:29] <kepler> Eagleman, try "sudo killall -HUP dnsmasq"
[11:30] <kepler> Eagleman, if not, this looks better:  sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start
[11:35] <diverdude> in /etc/fstab i have this: curlftpfs#uname:pwd@ftp://host /media/ftpmountdir fuse rw,uid=1000,umask=0777,user,suid,allow_other,exec,auto,utf8 0 1. But when i do sudo mount -a i get: Error connecting to ftp: Access denied: 530. However if i put the exact same credentials into filezilla it connects with no problems. What am I missing?
[11:39] <Kartagis> anyone to help? I've been asking for days but no answer
[11:39] <Kartagis> in cairo-dock, I've accidentally moved pidgin into firefox dock. how can I undo that?
[11:40] <Johnnie> Where is a folder for Operative Memory (DDR3 used)? I want to use hex editor. And I need to know where that memory places.
[11:41] <Johnnie> ! memory
[11:41] <ubottu> If you are wondering why some tools report your system has very little free memory, have a look at http://www.linuxatemyram.com/ | A short primer on Linux memory management can be found here: http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/software/linux-kernel/free-mem.html
[11:41] <bekks> Johnnie: /proc/kmem -- be careful, that file is as big as your RAM.
[11:47] <dr_willis> Kartagis:  why not just remove both and re-add them
[11:49] <Kartagis> dr_willis: I'm looking at cairo properties, pidgin is not there
[11:50] <MonkeyDust> Kartagis  there's also #cairo and #cairo-dock (irc channels)
[11:50] <Johnnie> bekks:thanks
[11:50] <Kartagis> MonkeyDust: I'm in #cairo-dock, no life
[11:51] <dr_willis> You can use the cairo-dock settngs tool where it has a >bottom dock and  >left dock   and drag things between the 2
[11:52] <xsobex787> dr. willis, do you know anything about php and html?
[11:52] <dr_willis> a little tree menu widgit. you can drag/drop from tree/branch to the next
[11:52] <dr_willis> xsobex787:  nope. i rarely need to mess with it
[11:52] <Kartagis> dr_willis: what package?
[11:52] <Kartagis> xsobex787: what is your issue?
[11:52] <xsobex787> if anybody in here has some experience, im having alittle difficulty there.  ty for any takers

[11:53] <dr_willis> nodoor:  not really a Ubuntu support question.
[11:53] <xsobex787> im trying to make a submit form for admins to recieve that form data via email im using a php script and an html file, i got the disign situation with the html, however the php script returns a white blank page, the server is currently not at its home location also.

[11:54] <skp1> MonkeyDust: what if i wanted t open it from chrome?
[11:54] <dr_willis> skp1:  gdebi has a gui front end you may need to install. 'gdebi' is a cli tool

[11:55] <Zhaboo> hi all, I want to run a _minimal_ version of KDE in a virtual machine (without all bells and whistles), any suggestions to which distro/package to look at? I am considering for example only installing debian and run apt-get install <some-kde-app> and then let it install its dependencies.
[11:55] <skp1> MonkeyDust: thank you
[11:55] <ichat> can anyone help me  troubleshooting why my system reboots instead of halted,    im thinking of installing  the from the mainline ppa  but it seams that it would   disbable  me from updating the kernel later on and i would have to   do it manually for ever?
[11:55] <challenger> i'm trying to install XP in virtualbox. I've created VHD at fixed 30GB size . but now if i'm trying to boot xp.iso . it starts normally but after some time it says "setup did not find any hard disk "
[11:55] <challenger> http://imagebin.org/242488
[11:56] <MonkeyDust> Zhaboo  you need plasma-desktop
[11:56] <bekks> Zhaboo: How is that related to Ubuntu then?
[11:56] <nodoor> Can I move(have) aircrack in ubuntu ?
[11:56] <antonio_> so it looks like its only happening on firefox and not other browsers...
[11:56] <bekks> challenger: a) use vdi instead of vhd and b) do not use a SATA controller, but an IDE controller for XP.
[11:57] <Zhaboo> bekks: I wonder if there are any minimalist ubuntu versions with KDE that I could also consider.
[11:57] <ichat> challenger:  -1 small itp for you to search on... driverpacks.net    use the  mass storage pack    ALLWAYS  check for virusses first...
[11:57] <dr_willis> !mini | Zhaboo
[11:57] <ubottu> Zhaboo: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[11:58] <truexfan404> Zhaboo: i believe i remember the ubuntu minimal iso having an option for the kubuntu desktop
[11:58] <Kartagis> whew
[11:58] <challenger> bekks, ichat : thanks guys , :)
[11:58] <Kartagis> I got it back
[11:58] <dr_willis> Zhaboo:  check out that qtrazor project also.
[11:58] <truexfan404> ^
[11:58] <dr_willis> Kartagis:  and now you go 'why dident i try that earlier' ;)

[12:00] <jnhghy> Hi, how/where can I set up a white list of sites to be accessible and all of the rest redirect to a specific ip address? using ubuntu 12.04
[12:00] <bekks> challenger: which doesnt change the fact that vhd isnt the native format virtualbox is using, and does not offer you all of the features offered for vdi.
[12:01] <ichat> challenger like is said  use driverpacks...  on your xp iso, it will add not hardware support including sata and  iscsi   ...
[12:01] <bekks> ichat: Driver packs are not needed, SP3 is needed.
[12:02] <ichat> bekks:  - i didn  know that sp3 added new hardware support to :P
[12:02] <ichat> anyway to mutch off topic for #ubuntu :P
[12:02] <Fudge> hi hoping someone may be able to help me, I have been for some weeks trying to get a windows laptop to print to my ubuntu cups with a usb hp deskjet
[12:02] <Fudge> at the stage now where a test page is sent but not printed, prints fine from ubuntu systems
[12:03] <challenger> bekks, could you elaborate whats the difference between VHD and VDI ( in terms of features),
[12:03] <dr_willis> Fudge:  the windows box sees the printer and can add it then?

I have two encrypted volumes one for the / and other for the swap, i have a not encrypted /boot. it tried creating a /bios but it didn't work i still get the same message
[12:03] <truexfan404> Fudge: do you have the printer shared via samba? thats the easiest way
[12:04] <challenger> yeah vdi is native format for virtualbox but i want to use that format on vmplayer too
[12:04] <ichat> funch:  so isntall the proper windows driver and have it connected via the correct,  protocol and be sure that  cubs is actually sharing it... or beter yet have samba share the printer for you
[12:04] <challenger> thats why i choose VHD
[12:04] <bekks> challenger: Resizing, compacting, etc.
[12:04] <challenger> not sure if vdi works on vmplayer too
[12:04] <Zhaboo> ubottu: thanks for the link
[12:04] <ubottu> Zhaboo: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[12:04] <bekks> challenger: Then I'd use VMDK instead of VHD...
[12:04] <Fudge> hi dr_willis, I can find it on win7 yes, can access server:631 fine, can release the test page but it does not print
[12:05] <Zhaboo> ooops, heh
[12:05] <jnhghy> Fudge: what printer?
[12:05] <jnhghy> Hi, how/where can I set up a white list of sites to be accessible and all of the rest redirect to a specific ip address? using ubuntu 12.04

[12:07] <nabblet> server->service
[12:07] <bekks> jnhghy: There are no wildcards in the /etc/hosts

[12:09] <wizrd> nabblet: dyn.com
[12:09] <challenger> one more ques. .should i choose fixed size or dynamic ? bekks
[12:09] <Kartagis> for some reason, cairo-dock had two instancesü
[12:09] <Kartagis> s/ü//
[12:10] <bekks> challenger: I'd use dynamic, most always.
[12:10] <challenger> bekks , would it be portable?
[12:10] <Fudge> dr_willis  /usr/lib/cups/backend/hp failed
[12:10] <jnhghy> Fudge: try changing the driver
[12:10] <jnhghy> Fudge in win7
[12:10] <Fudge> jnhghy  I dont think its a driver issue
[12:10] <MonkeyDust> challenger  you can export your virtual machines, to make them portable
[12:11] <nabblet> wizrd: afaik dyndns isn't free any more
[12:11] <bekks> challenger: Which format do you talk about now? :)
[12:11] <wizrd> nabblet: it still is for one subdomain
[12:11] <challenger>  hmmm for dynamic , vdi
[12:11] <challenger> oops
[12:11] <challenger> sorry :P
[12:12] <dr_willis> Fudge:  last i shared a printer to a windows box. I also set up home shares in /etc/samba/smb.conf and gave the users a samba password with 'sudo smbpasswd -a username'
[12:12] <challenger> MonkeyDust, .. exporting ..
[12:12] <dr_willis> Fudge:  i was also sure to use teh cups web interface to be sure the printers and server where shared and allowed access from the network
[12:12] <MonkeyDust> challenger  you can export them as .ova files
[12:12] <nabblet> wizrd: something like foo.dyn.com ?
[12:12] <Fudge> dr_willis samba was giving me trouble I dont know why
[12:12] <Fudge> makes me feel like going to buy a real network printer lol
[12:12] <dr_willis> Fudge:  cups web interface   http://localhost:631
[12:13] <bekks> challenger: Are you sure you can use a vdi with vmplayer? :)
[12:13] <challenger> isn't it good idea to configure everything for making it portable before installing
[12:13] <dr_willis> Fudge:  best $100 i spent was a brother network enabled laser printer
[12:13] <challenger> bekks : :X not so sure :P
[12:13] <Fudge> nabblet ` mooo.com is very easy to get going
[12:13] <bekks> challenger: Mostly, it is a pretty bad idea, when not using a portable format....
[12:13] <tuxinator> hi all
[12:13] <MonkeyDust> challenger  yes, the configuration is stored in the xported .ova file
[12:13] <tuxinator> does ubuntu mysql-server-5.1-66 from 10.04 come with openssl support?
[12:14] <challenger> MonkeyDust,  will it work on vmlayer too ? means can i import that file to vmplayer? .ova?
[12:14] <MonkeyDust> challenger  never used vmplayer, i'm no help there
[12:14] <asdf321> how do I create a mount point on gparted:?
[12:14] <challenger> bekks : now im totally confused  X:X )
[12:14] <craigbass1976> What is the best way to remote control an ubuntu box from a windows or mac that's out in the WAN?
[12:15] <dr_willis> craigbass1976:  ssh ;)
[12:15] <challenger> MonkeyDust,  :)
[12:15] <nabblet> Fudge: thx, will look at it. sad thing is that mosts dns service don't exactly specify what you get for free and where and the conditions :/
[12:15] <nabblet> Fudge: ofc it's totally understandable that they want paying custromers :D
[12:16] <challenger> pheww need to check vbox manuals RFM
[12:16] <Fudge> nabblet  ive set a few up on that site and its easy and no charge
[12:16] <Fudge> asdf321  just pull the box down and select a mount point, like /
[12:16] <asdf321> i don't see it anywhere
[12:16] <Fudge> dr_willis  when I view jobs on cups http the user heading says withheld
[12:17] <nabblet> Fudge: ok, thank you
[12:17] <Fudge> asdf321  are you installing and have received an error that you ahve not specifieed a mount point?
[12:17] <Fudge> nabblet np mate
[12:17] <dr_willis> Fudge:  the cups.org has docs and stuff.. but ive never seen that term used. ;) but ive not shared to a wqindows box in years
[12:17] <asdf321> Fudge, yes
[12:17] <asdf321> i am using crypto
[12:17] <asdf321> but i have a /boot not encrypted
[12:17] <Fudge> asdf321 go back, select your partition and where you choose format etc there is a mount poiint box, thats where you select
[12:18] <Johnnie> I had downloaded Ubuntu.iso and It did not boot. There are files with .exe. What's wrong? ISO had been burned.
[12:18] <Fudge> I have not set it up that way, but its when you edit teh partition you specify mount points asdf321 good luck
[12:18] <asdf321> there is no mount point box
[12:18] <bekks> Johnnie: Did you burn it as image, or did you burn a data cd?
[12:19] <typhlosion> hi i want to go to linuxmint-help channel how to do that
[12:19] <Johnnie> bekks: Like image
[12:19] <bekks> Johnnie: What happened exactly when trying to boot it?
[12:19] <MonkeyDust> typhlosion  #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[12:20] <craigbass1976> dr_willis, ahaha.  You funny guy, you.  He'd like that about as much as me telling him to stop using windows and macs...
[12:20] <Tex_Nick> asdf321 : this is of course after the fact ... but the preferable method to setup a dual boot ( windows & ubuntu ) is to install windows first ... tis a little easier that way
[12:20] <asdf321> I couldn't
[12:20] <asdf321> because I installed it and the ubuntu installer didn't see anything but one partition only with 1TB
[12:20] <wizrd> nabblet: exactly like foo.dyn.com. You have to register for a pro trial and cancel that within 14 days. then you'll keep the subdomain.
[12:21] <asdf321> also the debian installer didn't see it either

BUT after i  do   apt-get-purge linux-image-3.7  (so reverted back to my main kernel)  the shotwon issue seams away....  how can i troubleshoot,
[12:36] <challenger> dr_willis: yup guvcview, cheese

[12:37] <challenger> and how can i detect my cam inside vbox?
[12:37] <challenger> it works fine on cheese and other cam apps
[12:37] <MonkeyDust> challenger  it's probably a USB device, check the vbox USB settings
[12:38] <challenger> MonkeyDust,  it is attached to my laptop . (lenovo)

[12:38] <dr_willis> challenger:   You are running teamviewer in vbox?

[12:40] <challenger> ichat, MonkeyDust : thanks for the info
[12:40] <ichat> challenger do a  sudo lsusb  find your webcam id... and than forward the device in your  vbux  usb  settings... it may require the  nonfree  extention...
[12:41] <dr_willis> freakynl:    You can do a full install onto a usb flah drive.  ive ran that way for months on end. :) never managed to  break one.

[12:42] <raven_> ubuntu 12.10 + vsftpd: i am trying to setup a sftp server with virtual users they access all on the same folder  but i cannot connect by any reason need please
[12:42] <freakynl> and it would be running for years (~4-5 or so) :)
[12:43] <ichat> challger you mean it works for cheese install inside the virtual machine or cheese on the host
[12:43] <challenger> ichat: how ? X) :P
[12:43] <dr_willis> Hmm.. is vsftp a 'sftp' server?  i thoght ssh could do sftp wthout any other services
[12:43] <ee12096> Francisco silva
[12:43] <challenger> cheese on the host
[12:44] <freakynl> raven_: don't you mean ftps? sftp is a whole other protocol than ftp and comes from ssh
[12:44] <ichat> challernger so  read up on how to forward usb devices to clients  on virtualbox
[12:44] <freakynl> ftps however is just regular FTP with a SSL layer, similar to http vs https
[12:44] <raven_> freakynl, i need any "secure ftp" service
[12:44] <ichat> aka just coppy paste to google...
[12:45] <dr_willis> raven_:  ssh and sftp would be the way to go i imagine. a ftp server  is rarely needed these days i find.
[12:45] <challenger> ichat : )   lemme try this one too, i'm facing this one prob from 6 months cudn't get any solution , even tried mint , fedora
[12:45] <raven_> dr_willis, yes sftp would be nice but how to setup - what do i need for that?
[12:46] <dr_willis> raven_:  install the ssh server.. and it should work i belive
[12:46] <ichat> dr_willis:  sft gets quite some overhead on large files... but than again  id use dav
[12:46] <raven_> dr_willis, i need to work with virtual users they all have access to the same subfolder and have no access to shell
[12:46] <dr_willis> I use ssh/sftp from my android pone.
[12:47] <dr_willis> raven_:  i imagine its doable. I never need to do that.
[12:47] <raven_> dr_willis, and i need any idea how
[12:47] <dr_willis> not sure why that would need 'virtual users'
[12:47] <dr_willis> sounds like normal 'groups' could do that.
[12:48] <dr_willis> theres all sorts of books and guides on ssh/sftp  most of which ive never needed to read. ;)
[12:48] <freakynl> raven_: http://howto.gumph.org/content/setup-virtual-users-and-directories-in-vsftpd/ (for debian, but ubuntu is debian based so shouldn't matter much)
[12:49] <dr_willis> Night all.. bed time for the Dr.
[12:49] <raven_> freakynl, i set up a vsftpd server already but i cannot connect to it
[12:49] <freakynl> raven_: please post output on pastebin or something: 'netstat -ntl; iptables -L -v -n'
[12:50] <raven_> freakynl, first i have to find any verbose messages..... my client only tells me about connection errors

[13:24] <Median> So I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my ASUS UX32A, but the installer/ubuntu refuses to start. It successfully loads all modules and such, but gets stuck at "Starting.." just before it was going to start Ubuntu. Any ideas?
[13:25] <TomyLobo> can "kdesudo su otheruser -c /home/otheruser/one_of_his_programs" harm me?
[13:26] <TomyLobo> can "kdesudo -- su otheruser -c /home/otheruser/one_of_his_programs" harm me?
[13:27] <dcherniv> TomyLobo, yes
[13:27] <jrib> TomyLobo: why don't you use sudo -u instead of using su like that?
[13:30] <TomyLobo> jrib, that definitely gives the program access to my files
[13:30] <jrib> TomyLobo: what do you mean?
[13:30] <TomyLobo> at least that's what dr_willis indicated earlier
[13:31] <TomyLobo> basically the program is some proprietary shit i dont trust and i set up a user for it
[13:31] <jrib> TomyLobo: it runs the command as the user you specify
[13:32] <TomyLobo> so it has a nice box to act in while the rest of my system, including my home folder, is safe from it
[13:32] <jrib> TomyLobo: the difference between doing « sudo -u user command » and « su -c command user » is that in the first case you use the fact you have sudo powers to run as the other user and in the second case you actually need to be able to login as user
[13:33] <TomyLobo> jrib, su does not ask for a password if run as root :)
[13:33] <jrib> TomyLobo: correct
[13:33] <TomyLobo> hence the kdesudo before it

[14:15] <sekou> cool jil, cool
[14:15] <t2mkn> i like Unity style, and I m liking the Workspace thing on Gnome shell :) On shell when one is at Activities panel all things come in front. But in unity I cant see what I have on other workspaces. Is their any way I can have that in Unity?
[14:15] <jil> sekou  I'm cool
[14:16] <zoie> i'm getting "p11-kit: couldn't load module: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkcs11/gnome-keyring-pkcs11.so: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkcs11/gnome-keyring-pkcs11.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" everytime i use svn; is there a way to fix that?
[14:16] <MonkeyDust> t2mkn  it's like that by default in Unity, the indicator for apps on other workspaces is a little different
[14:16] <sekou> ok what's the matter again?
[14:16] <jil> How come when I install the latest ubuntu It display a floppy drive.  I don't have one, so how do I remove it ?
[14:17] <jil> Because when I switch on tty display I have a repeated I/O error on dev fd0 sector0
[14:17] <jrib> TomyLobo: I almost forgot, you may want to consider creating an apparmor profile for it and using that
[14:17] <t2mkn> humm, any plans in Unity for that cool thing to bring in?
[14:18] <jil> I have commented the line loading the fd0 in fstab, but I still get the error.
[14:18] <jhutchins_wk> jil: You could probably blacklist the floppy module, although I don't know if that's an official solution.
[14:19] <jil> what do you mean "blacklist" the floppy module?
[14:19] <digitalfiz> hey guys for some reason when windows are maximized in unity the window buttons are on the left like I like them but when not maximized they are on the right. How can I fix this?
[14:19] <jhutchins_wk> jil: create a file in /etc/modules.d that prevents the floppy kernel module from loading.
[14:20] <iLogical> if anyone could help with this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12449987#post12449987 it would be great

[14:22] <jil> hum, yes me too because I don't have a /etc/modules.d
[14:22] <iLogical> what kind of summary?
[14:22] <TomyLobo> jrib, i'll take a look at that, thanks
[14:23] <jhutchins_wk> jil: Well, you can create one, and you can blacklist within /etc/modules
[14:23] <jil> Ok, but I was hoping to see a readme file on how to blacklist.
[14:24] <jil> I guess I have to use modprobe

[14:29] <jil> jhutchins_wk I'm digging too... I found three line pointing to the floppy in modprobe configuration
[14:30] <jhutchins_wk> jil: Probably comment those out, or add "blacklist floppy" to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[14:30] <jil> but I'm not getting the syntax yet
[14:37] <jil> for example$ alias acpi*:PNP0700:*  floppy        any idea how to read this?

[14:41] <jil> jhutchins_wk, I would like to but it's not coming from a file.   and I looked for a line with floppy in the modprobe.d/  without success.  But now that I have the module name I think it will be ok.  thx

[15:53] <usr13> fedor: What is the "win-like behavior" ?    :)
[15:53] <theadmin> fedor: The scrolling thing is app specific. Firefox can do that.

[15:53] <fedor> well, i mean when you press the middle button in ubuntu you paste something. What i want is to make to behave like a scroll button in windows

[15:54] <fedor> I know about that. You can install scroll-extension in browsers.
[15:54] <usr13> fedor: It should scroll when you turn it.  But, do you never find the need to paste?
[15:55] <theadmin> marsfligth: You missed one. The screensaver is set to "Blank screen" by default. :P
[15:55] <badfinger> it's a known problem with older dell laptops

[15:55] <badfinger> I know I made this work once

[15:55] <fedor> so is it possible
[15:56] <badfinger> so what's the 12.10 equivalent of system>administrator
[15:56] <usr13> fedor: But in linux we have more options.  You can have one paste from Ctrl-v and a second one from the middle mouse button, so that you can carry two separate pastes to your document.
[15:56] <theadmin> badfinger: There really isn't any apart from the Settings application thing.

[16:01] <Quest> theadmin,  why people use ~/.bashrc and /etc/profile?
[16:01] <escott> cebor, probably
[16:01] <escott> !grub | cebor
[16:01] <ubottu> cebor: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows?

[16:01] <MonkeyDust> nazty  odd, should be
[16:01] <ubottu> CoreyBR: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[16:01] <nazty> theadmin: what should i use to write a iso to a flash drive?
[16:01] <jrib> Quest: you may want to read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables to learn what the different files do.  But theadmin gave you the right file for what you asked
[16:01] <theadmin> Quest: Eh. bashrc is just a shell script that gets executed by bash on login. /etc/profile is same. You *could* set the variables in /etc/profile but...
[16:01] <Diegosnat> hi guys, how can i solve this problem? http://pastebin.com/EKueZ6Jj
[16:01] <theadmin> nazty: What OS are you currently on?
[16:02] <badfinger> *though
[16:02] <nazty> kubuntu
[16:02] <nazty> the lastest release
[16:02] <Quest> theadmin,  and  bash.bashrc
[16:02] <CoreyBR> i wanna change my ubuntu's loading splash screen, the help website says to install gnome-splashscreen-manager package but i cant find it in synaptic, any clues?
[16:02] <MonkeyDust> nazty  just tried, it is as I said
[16:02] <theadmin> nazty: Ok. There's a "USB Image Writer" tool. But you can also use the terminal: sudo dd if=something.iso of=/dev/sdb
[16:02] <Quest> theadmin,  but..?
[16:02] <jrib> CoreyBR: what website?
[16:03] <theadmin> Quest: But what's the point of writing a whole shell script with "export" and stuff if you can set it in a file? :P
[16:03] <CoreyBR> jrib, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuEyeCandy
[16:03] <thompcha> MonkeyDust: yes, ubuntu server 12.10
[16:03] <CoreyBR> i cant change my cursor either
[16:03] <MonkeyDust> thompcha  they have their own channel   #ubuntu-server
[16:03] <darryl> nazty, also unetbootin works
[16:04] <thompcha> ah! thanks!
[16:04] <theadmin> darryl: It works... sometimes.
[16:04] <jrib> CoreyBR: so what version of ubuntu are you using?
[16:04] <theadmin> darryl: For me it doesn't. Might be hardware-specific or something but I never managed to get it to work.
[16:04] <nazty> darryl: its asking me for the admin password when i start it
[16:04] <CoreyBR> jrib, 12.10
[16:04] <darryl> theadmin, dunno worked for me
[16:05] <jrib> CoreyBR: doesn't the link you gave me say "prior to 11.04"?  See ubottu for how to change your splash now...
[16:05] <jil> What's the support channel for wine? #wine is empty.
[16:05] <jrib> !plymouth | CoreyBR
[16:05] <ubottu> CoreyBR: Plymouth manages the Ubuntu boot process (before the root filesystem is mounted) and also provides a graphical boot animation.  To change your Plymouth theme use « sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth && sudo update-initramfs -u »
[16:05] <jrib> jil: #winehq
[16:05] <nazty> ahhh i can sudo unetbootin and it works
[16:05] <CoreyBR> jrib, sorry i'm still learning english
[16:05] <CoreyBR> :\
[16:05] <jil> jrib.  thankyou.  why is it not wine?
[16:05] <escott> !gksudo | nazty
[16:05] <ubottu> nazty: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[16:05] <jrib> jil: you have to ask them :)

[16:21] <CoreyBR> my ubuntu is now locking the screen anymore, how can i fix it?
[16:21] <stoic> CoreyBR,  use caffiene
[16:21] <MonkeyDust> Miebster  firstly: windows should sit on /dev/sda1   first install windows, then linux
[16:22] <Miebster> MonkeyDust: I don't have windows
[16:22] <escott> Miebster, your bootloader got installed to sdb for some reason. don't know why
[16:22] <blackline> Actually found the answer to my own question. Thanks anyway :)
[16:22] <usr13> badfinger: see my PM
[16:22] <escott> Miebster, if you will run the following commands we can fix it up
[16:23] <escott> Miebster, sudo -i; mkdir /ubuntu; mount /dev/sda1 /ubuntu; mount --bind /dev /ubuntu/dev; chroot /ubuntu; grub-install /dev/sda;
[16:23] <escott> Miebster, run them one after the other stopping at each ";"
[16:23] <escott> Miebster, stop and ask about any errors
[16:24] <optraz> i want a package, webcalendar but apparently it stop at the lucid, any public repo offer this package?
[16:25] <Miebster> escott: done, no errors
[16:25] <escott> Miebster, ok then you should be able to type "exit" twice and if you rerun the bootinfoscript it should say "grub2 is installed on the mbr of /dev/sda and points to the first partitition of the same disk"
[16:27] <Miebster> escott: confirmed, reboot?
[16:27] <escott> Miebster, that should do it for you. make sure to remove that sdb usb device whatever it is
[16:27] <Miebster> escott: its just a thumb drive, why remove it?
[16:28] <escott> Miebster, it confused the installer. probably because that partition is flagged with the bootable flag
[16:28] <escott> Miebster, in the future its best not to have random extraneous disks in the system when installing
[16:28] <Miebster> escott: ah, thanks

[16:32] <jil> every user of the computer...
[16:33] <theadmin> jil: What do you mean, "make available"? It registers itself with binfmt_support so double-clicking an exe file will run it in wine...

[16:37] <RollinV2> jil, why not virtualize either windows or linux and get the best of both worlds?
[16:37] <theadmin> jil: Eh. Wine apps don't get shared across users, since they are installed per-user. You'd have to install them for every account (easily accomplishable by copying over the .wine folder, like this: sudo cp -r ~/.wine /home/*/

[16:54] <Third3ye> Design flaw on part of Ubuntu: don't tell the user nothing.. they're stupid

[16:54] <theadmin> Third3ye: Because Ubuntu is meant to be simple. Advanced users use the CLI where they get all the output anyway.
[16:54] <usr13> Miebster: /ignore #ubutnu all -public -actions
[16:55] <Redi> theadmin: Thanks, I will risk it.
[16:55] <Third3ye> theadmin: It should leave you with an easy google-able error code, like WIndows or OS X -- which are Ubuntus direct competitors
[16:55] <Miebster> usr13: Unknown Command
[16:55] <theadmin> Redi: As in, the -updates version may fail to work leaving you with nothing but a CLI interface. If that happens, just "sudo apt-get remove fglrx-updates".

[16:56] <Miebster> usr13: empathy
[16:57] <usr13> Miebster: Maybe empathy does not recognize those commands.  Try the help files or docs.
[16:57] <sogeking99> RollinV2: This works great, one thing. Can I change the order of playlists? I like them to be in alphabetical order if possible. And I made them in the wrong order (used to auto sorting like itunes)
[16:58] <theadmin> Miebster: The problem is empathy isn't really an IRC client... Use a real one, designed specifically for IRC, rather than one that is designed for IM.
[16:58] <Miebster> theadmin: which one?
[16:58] <usr13> Miebster: /join #empathy
[16:58] <theadmin> Miebster: Well, I suggest irssi on the commandline and Quassel in the graphical interface.
[16:59] <usr13> Miebster: irssi is good.
[16:59] <MonkeyDust> irssi <3
[16:59] <jil> allright, Wine is working on other accounts.  copying the right files and changing ownership of those file was enought.
[16:59] <z_Chanshark> MonkeyDust:  my wifi adapter  listed but it says i need to use  ndiswapper to install the drivers but every time i try to get ndiswrapper to work i get this error " fatal: module ndiswrapper not found"

[17:00] <usr13> jil: People only believe what they want to believe.
[17:00] <Miebster> Okay so while letting the package manager update, it gave me a modal "configure grub dialog" But I just got grub working, so continue without changing anything?  (This is the dialog that hosed me up the first time)
[17:01] <jrib> Miebster: check the differences?
[17:01] <MonkeyDust> z_Chanshark  try installing ndisgtk
[17:01] <Miebster> jrib: what do you mean ?
[17:01] <z_Chanshark> i have reinstalled it
[17:01] <jil> usr13 I'd say They believe what they like to beleive and one likes to believe that he made the right choices in the past.  we are a change relunctant specie and the ubuntu community should study behavioral psychology to make change more effective.
[17:02] <jrib> Miebster: I'm assuming you are at a dialog about a package maintainer's config file differing from yours.  If that's true, you can ask for a diff to compare the two versions

[17:04] <Miebster> jrib: thats why I am afraid to touch it
[17:04] <Miebster> jrib: but I have to, its modal, this is crazy
[17:04] <jrib> Miebster: don't check anything then.  Worst case scenario, you can't boot, and you have to use a live cd to reconfigure grub
[17:04] <singharkirat> I have to boot to recovery and them select resume normal boot.. And system starts but with a bad resoltion... And help?
[17:05] <Miebster> jrib: yeah... but thats what happened 2 hours ago
[17:05] <jrib> Miebster: then, check something :)
[17:05] <z_Chanshark> MonkeyDust:  i have re-installed it, and some guides i have tried install the source and a few other things and non of them seem to work

[17:06] <nyuszika7h> hi, how can I allow connections to port 22 from LAN? this doesn't seem to work:

[17:07] <nyuszika7h> usr13: seriously, do I look that stupid? I obviously installed it. (sorry)
[17:07] <nyuszika7h> MonkeyDust: you don't get my point, I don't want it to be accessible from the WAN

[17:07] <nyuszika7h> (to WAN)
[17:07] <z_Chanshark> MonkeyDust:  because ndiswrapper is for installing windows wifi drivers
[17:08] <jil> escott thanks for the sharing the sharing tip
[17:08] <MonkeyDust> z_Chanshark  linux has wifi drivers, too, i for one don't use windows drivers
[17:08] <rosenzweig> Are the ATI legacy drivers (for Radeon HD 4000 and under chips) available in the Ubuntu repositories?
[17:08] <usr13> nyuszika7h: nmap -p22 192.168.1.x
[17:09] <z_Chanshark> MonkeyDust:  my wifi adapter only comes with windows drivers that why i need to use ndiswapper because it allowed me to use windows drivers on linux
[17:09] <jrib> nyuszika7h: I'm not familiar with ufw syntax but https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW#Allow_and_Deny_.28specific_rules.29 seems to use: sudo ufw allow from <ip address> to <protocol> port <port number> proto <protocol name>

[17:12] <z_Chanshark> MonkeyDust:  i have tried to install it and it just does nothing
[17:12] <Third3ye> Why HDMI video works but HDMI audio doesn't. I've tried upgrading ALSA, I've tried varying settings in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf...
[17:12] <theadmin> Third3ye: Well, the thing is, not everyone here is a guru. This isn't any commercial support. Most come here to ask questions, like you. Those who answer are just volunteers who know how to solve this or that. You're just unlucky, nobody who's looking at the channel right now knows how to solve your problem.

[17:13] <gdc77> Third3ye: I'd try the forums, theadmin is right maybe you're just unlucky that nobody here knows the answer right now
[17:13] <theadmin> Third3ye: You could also try http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com
[17:13] <gdc77> or they aren't looking
[17:13] <z_Chanshark> Third3ye:  have you scanned with make sure it detects it
[17:13] <Third3ye> I've already posted to askubuntu.com
[17:14] <usr13> nyuszika7h: NetAudit tcp port scanner for Android.
[17:14] <gdc77> Third3ye: do you dual boot?
[17:14] <Third3ye> z_Chanshark: the module is loaded, the codec shows up in sound settings, and HDMI output is also there - but will not output sound
[17:14] <usr13> nyuszika7h: Seems to wrok fine.
[17:14] <Third3ye> gdc77: no, I've just got Ubuntu
[17:15] <z_Chanshark> is the volume off? like turn up the sound some
[17:15] <gdc77> Third3ye: ah, i was going to say test it in Windows, but i guess that's out
[17:16] <gdc77> Third3ye: hardware support has pretty much always been the limiting issue with linux in general
[17:16] <MonkeyDust> Third3ye  sometimes, things work in a live session, but not in an installation -- try again in a live session
[17:16] <gdc77> Third3ye: do you have the proprietary drivers for your graphics card installed?
[17:16] <Third3ye> gdc77: I know it works in Windows, I just recently installed
[17:16] <Tellmarch> Hello, I was wondering, is the java of ubuntu vulnerable to the latest security flaw that is in the news?
[17:16] <Third3ye> gdc77: yes, nvidia-experimental-310
[17:17] <gdc77> Third3ye: experimental?
[17:17] <yeehi> Updated firmware for a SSD is v important. Will Ubuntu Quantal do this automatically, after installation? Samsung 840 pro
[17:17] <theadmin> Tellmarch: Ubuntu uses OpenJDK rather than Oracle's JVM. But since they share a lot of the same codebase, it may be possible. However, I'm not quite sure which vulnerability you mean. A link would help.
[17:17] <gdc77> Third3ye: which card?
[17:17] <Tellmarch> theadmin, http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617
[17:17] <Third3ye> gdc77: it was recommended by the steam docu, but stable didn't work with hdmi audio neither
[17:17] <Third3ye> gdc77: GeForce 6800M GT

[17:19] <theadmin> Tellmarch: Hm. I am not sure. May be fixed by now...
[17:19] <Tellmarch> I read in the news that the only "fix" is to disable the java plugins...
[17:20] <Miebster> So installing the nvidia-current didn't do anything, still only 1 display, no other options

[17:22] <Third3ye> Miebster: alternatively you can google for the output of lspci |grep VGA or install hwinfo and run hwinfo --gfx
[17:23] <gdc77> Third3ye: there's a command to set the sound profile apparently
[17:23] <gdc77> Third3ye, maybe it won't work for you though, it got downvoted here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/237230/tv-screen-disconnect-when-playing-sound-over-hdmi
[17:24] <usr13> ixio2: NP
[17:24] <Third3ye> gdc77: no, that just changes to the HDMI codec -- which the media settings in KDE is capable of doing
[17:25] <Miebster> Third3ye: Found nvidia setting option in SysInfo (which doens't come with ubuntu) and not in system settings (still shows old setting page)
[17:26] <gdc77> Third3ye, see what Miebster wrote

I rebooted to see if that would help and now the wireless menu is gone from

[18:13] <demonio> I installed ubuntu 12.10 but my graphich card gets mistake
[18:13] <demonio> Can anyone help me ?
[18:13] <feeshon> demonio: What graphics card are you using?
[18:14] <rosenzweig> Okay, I have a small issue.
[18:14] <feeshon> demonio: What driver are you using?
[18:14] <SwedeMike> mat619: you should verify using wireshark on the local box that you're actually getting the packet destined for port 22.
[18:14] <rosenzweig> I had to install the legacy ati drivers through the package on the AMD website.
[18:14] <rosenzweig> For what ever reason they didn't work and now I'm on fallback drivers.
[18:14] <mat619> SwedeMike: I thought about using wireshark for analysis but installing it on that system would be overkill - it's a thinclient running of a CF card
[18:15] <rosenzweig> I tried uninstalling the ati drivers via the uninstall script and when I did that I couldn't boot to the desktop (it would hang on the background picture after log in).
[18:15] <mat619> SwedeMike: and I don't have a system at hand right now that could serve as packet sniffer
[18:15] <rosenzweig> How do I completely uninstall the ATI driver package?

[18:17] <Lebby> feeshon:  i'm not sure ... but it could ... you must check you hostname
[18:17] <mat619> for fun i also tried bbssh from my blackberry, that just times out and states "Notice: NULL". very informative
[18:17] <SwedeMike> mat619: try tcpdump instead then. "tcpdump -i eth0 port 22"
[18:18] <Lebby> feeshon:  then i suggest to remove samba ... autoremove ... update ... upgrade and then reinstall samba
[18:19] <mat619> SwedeMike: good point, completely forgot about the obvious

[18:32] <syrius> Having an issue and not sure if anyone else has experienced this lately. A few days ago I noticed grub2 updated itself. For the first time since I've owned this laptop, I'm having intermittent boot issues.
[18:32] <syrius> It makes it to grub each time, but getting different errors from there that prevent it from booting into ubuntu
[18:32] <syrius> Error: file not found.... Error: device not found... Need to load kernel first, etc.. Among others..
[18:33] <escott> syrius, could it be that there is a new kernel?
[18:33] <syrius> Is that indicative of anything from any initial impressions?

[18:33] <FloodBot1> syrius: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[18:33] <escott> syrius, in either case its a timing issue. you can add some rootdelay args to the kernel or add some delays to grub

[18:44] <Lebby> feeshon:  when u done ... call me
[18:44] <syrius> escott: alright. 5 should be adequate?
[18:44] <escott> syrius, add to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT

[18:44] <syrius> escott: I see the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. Thank you :)
[18:44] <escott> syrius, it could be you need a delay somewhere else in the boot, but thats the most commonly used one for the kernel
[18:45] <fxworker> When I try this command from another server, it has no access: sudo nmap -P0 -sU server1_IP
[18:45] <syrius> escoot: it's so odd, because I've been using this day in and day out for months now, and yesterday is the first time it started doing it
[18:45] <syrius> maybe i should roll back a kernel and see if it keeps happening
[18:45] <escott> syrius, thats a good way to verify if it is the kernel
[18:46] <escott> syrius, but it is not in and of itself strange that the kernel change could cause a timing issue

[19:24] <nibbler> irule: what is encryption good for, if there is no key to decrypt?
[19:24] <nibbler> irule: you can have a remote-decryptable server, during boot you'd have to ssh to it to enter the password

I shouldn't have restarted my computer although I was just stuck on a dos looking screen with nothing happening and my HDD led on my computer was blinking anymore so I guess something went wrong

[20:13] <Wulf> How can I change default settings of 12.04 login screen? I want everyone to use the "ubuntu 2d" session
[20:14] <xangua> Wulf clic on the icon next to the username and you can set the default session there
[20:14] <xangua> in the login screen*
=== ubuntu__ is now known as Guest59670
[20:15] <Wulf> xangua: and does that apply to every user? Can I remove the setting so the users cannot change it?
=== chiluk is now known as chiluk_away
[20:15] <eutheria> when installing form the mini.iso it is asking for user details first, it used to be that you configured your partitions first, is it going to let me configure my partitions or blow away everything?
[20:16] <un2him> eutheria, you can always install inside of virtualbox first, to see what happens...i do that all the time
[20:16] <eutheria> un2him, i can't as i have nothing left
[20:16] <eutheria> this machine has almost no disk space
[20:17] <eutheria> the machine i am trying to recover would be my normal place for installing vm's
[20:18] <jhutchins_wk> Steven4242: Download the netinstall image.

[20:22] <riderplus> how can i add a desktop shortcut for a disk driver in unity?
[20:22] <riderplus> i mean...there's drag and drop for apps,
[20:22] <riderplus> but how to do it for disk drives?
[20:23] <stueng> ?metro
[20:23] <stueng> er
[20:23] <stueng> lol
[20:23] <orudie> what is the name of the utility that makes all the menues appear at the very top ?
[20:23] <stueng> not metro.. whats the ubuntu desktop thing called? the one everytone hates?
[20:23] <orudie> I want it disabled if its possible
[20:24] <KsM> stueng: unity/gnome3
[20:24] <Willdude123> How can I find the path of OpenJDK?
[20:24] <syrius> which javac ?
[20:24] <sosby> Would anyone know how (or point me in the direction) as to how to set up a bridge to allow a LXC container to send/recieve from/to an outside ip
[20:24] <MonkeyDust> Willdude123  with which
[20:24] <stueng> KsM no.. the thing that makes the "start" type button
[20:24] <Hwkiller> orudie: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/disable-appmenu-global-menu-in-ubuntu.html
[20:24] <stueng> looks all pretty
[20:24] <riderplus> does anyone know how to do it?
[20:24] <blami> Willdude123: it will be in /usr/lib/jvm afaik
[20:24] <stueng> ?? unity
[20:25] <stueng> !unity
[20:25] <ubottu> Unity is the default UI since Ubuntu 11.04.  Unity is a shell for GNOME. see http://unity.ubuntu.com. For a GNOME 2-like experience, see !notunity
[20:25] <stueng> !notunity
[20:25] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[20:25] <WHAT_UP> say i have an old version of ubuntu installed on a computer, and i want to just install a new version of ubuntu over it (no need for the current data). is it possible to somehow net install ubuntu without resorting to using a disc?
[20:25] <stueng> WHAT_UP apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
[20:25] <riderplus> so nobody knows...
[20:25] <riderplus> super
[20:25] <WHAT_UP> stueng: no
[20:25] <pianoman> hi i tried installing ubuntu via disk and when i hit the button to continue to install inside windows 8, it told me to eject the disc and press enter. it then restarted into windows 8 without installing it. what happened?
[20:25] <toordog> is anyone played with FreeIPA ipa-client on ubuntu?
[20:26] <Slart> stueng, WHAT_UP. dist-upgrade won't upgrade the ubuntu version
[20:26] <Cakejoke> does anyone know of anything that could prevent ubuntu from connecting to https sites?
[20:26] <WHAT_UP> Cakejoke: bad root certificate?
[20:26] <Slart> WHAT_UP: how old is the "old version"?
[20:27] <WHAT_UP> Slart: i think it's intrepid?
[20:27] <z_Chanshark> i have ubuntu 3 :D
[20:27] <riderplus> WHAT_UP: do you know?
[20:27] <WHAT_UP> it's the first one which had unity
[20:27] <Willdude123> Installed OpenJDK, don't think it's there.
[20:27] <MonkeyDust> WHAT_UP  type lsb_release -sd
[20:28] <Toph2> Cakejoke,,, i had that once,, it was my router
[20:28] <Slart> WHAT_UP: if you want to do a "regular" upgrade you will have to mess with the repositories since intrepid is past it's end of life.. not sure if there are some clever way of doing a net install using the existing install.. installing from an usb stick isn't an option?
[20:28] <Cakejoke> it doesn't happen on windows or anything else in the network though
[20:28] <WHAT_UP> MonkeyDust: it's natty
[20:28] <Steven4242> jhutchins_wk: awesome that idea worked and I am currently reinstalling. Thank you so much for your help! I really really appreciate it!
[20:28] <Toph2> Cakejoke,,, just certain urls?
[20:29] <Cakejoke> seems to be all https i've tried
[20:29] <eutheria> is there a rescue cd?
[20:29] <eutheria> i am sure there used to be one
[20:29] <Toph2> Cakejoke,,, have you a firewall on the Ubuntu machine?
[20:29] <pianoman> hi i tried installing ubuntu via disk and when i hit the button to continue to install inside windows 8, it told me to eject the disc and press enter. it then restarted into windows 8 without installing it. what happened?
[20:29] <Cakejoke> i didn't install any
[20:30] <Cakejoke> i'm on win atm, gimme a sec to reboot
[20:30] <Toph2> Cakejoke,,, and you can ping your router?

[20:30] <sam555> hello all!
[20:30] <Willdude123> Anyone know how I can find the OpenJDK path?
[20:30] <orudie> this did not disable menues in unity
[20:30] <orudie> any help plz
[20:30] <sam555> i need to replace my interface file because it is not working
[20:31] <sam555> how do I do this without lubuntu booting and crashing when it tries to make it work
[20:31] <daftykins> sam555: network interfaces?
[20:31] <sam555> is there a way to skip the network authentication part so I canget in
[20:31] <sam555> daftykins: yes
[20:31] <Willdude123> Anyone?
[20:31] <pianoman> i installed windows 8. i put the iso for ubuntu onto a disk and rebooted. i selected the drive i wanted and i went into ubuntu setup. i hit install ubuntu, connected to a network, and hit install inside windows 8. and then it gave me that message.
[20:31] <orudie> in Ubuntu 12.04 I want all menues for all applications to appear in the application itself, but not in the unity at the top. Is there a way to fix it ?
[20:31] <Eagleman> Trying to start with a fresh install of postfix, however dkpg  dpkg-reconfigure postfix  wont remove my old config files, any idea what i am doing wrong?
[20:31] <daftykins> sam555: all you really need is "auto lo" then "auto eth0 inet dhcp"
[20:31] <sam555> daftykins: right now I'm using an lubuntu usb live disk to try to remove it, but I don't have access to root on the hdd
[20:32] <sam555> daftykins: but how do I change it before i reboot again
[20:32] <WHAT_UP> why doesn't the minimal install cd just ping canonical's website to find out what the latest version is, rather than being hardcoded to download a certain one?
[20:32] <z_Chanshark> hmmm
[20:32] <daftykins> sam555: er just sudo -s on the liveusb to modify
[20:32] <bfri> i just installed maple 16 but can't find the progam launcher where can i find it?
[20:32] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  did it like load it
[20:32] <z_Chanshark> like did it take time
[20:32] <sam555> daftykins: kk
[20:33] <pianoman> no it took no time at all. 5 seconds after i hit continue it told me to eject the disk and hit enter. which i did.
[20:33] <z_Chanshark> like did it take less then 5 seconds
[20:34] <WHAT_UP> bfri: does just running maple work in the terminal? if so, try "which maple". otherwise, look for something like .maple in your home directory probably
[20:34] <sam555> daftykins: how do i get to /etc/network from the live disk to the hdd?
[20:34] <Eagleman> Trying to start with a fresh install of postfix, however dkpg  dpkg-reconfigure postfix  wont remove my old config files, any idea what i am doing wrong?
[20:34] <daftykins> sam555: you'll need to mount the partition first. do you know which one will be root? (/) did you manually or auto partition?
[20:34] <orudie> is there a way to make the menu items for apps appear in the app window, but not all the way at the top ?
[20:34] <sam555> daftykins: when I go to media/lubuntu/<numbers for hdd>/ it does not have access to the root drive
[20:34] <Slart> Eagleman: there isn't a switch to restart with clean config files?
[20:35] <bfri> what_up how do i run it from the terminal?
[20:35] <daftykins> sam555: can you pastebin the output of 'sudo fdisk -l' ?
[20:35] <pianoman> z_Chanshark yes pretty much. according to the instructions i should have been able to go through more options
[20:35] <sam555> daftykins: so I need to mount the /root partition specifically? because i can get into my home directory on the hdd
[20:35] <WHAT_UP> bfri: try opening up the terminal and just typing in "maple"
[20:35] <Eagleman> a switch like Slart ?
[20:35] <sam555> daftykins: from the live disk
[20:35] <WHAT_UP> bfri: does it work?
[20:35] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  few things first check if the disk is installed
[20:35] <bfri> no
[20:35] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  not installed *scratched
[20:35] <bfri> what_up no
[20:36] <Slart> Eagleman: I don't know.. I'm browsing the man pages at the moment.. didn't really see anything
[20:36] <pianoman> z_Chanshark no its not its a brand new disk
[20:36] <Cakejoke> kay, don't mind me, a reboot did the trick :P
[20:36] <daftykins> sam555: root is just /, /root is the root user's /home equivalent :) just to be confusing :>
[20:36] <bfri> what_up now im not sure if the install worked
[20:36] <WHAT_UP> bfri: okay. then in the terminal, try doing something like "ls -al | grep maple"
[20:36] <Eagleman> i've been there to Slart, i expected the command to reload everything, so i can begin from scratch
[20:36] <WHAT_UP> bfri: does it give any output?
[20:36] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  second when you burned it to a disk is it a .ios file and did you burn it and not use it like a flash drive
[20:36] <Slart> Eagleman: yes, that's what I would expect as well
=== GabMus is now known as GabMus_
[20:37] <GabMus_> hello
[20:37] <Slart> Eagleman: have you read this? http://askubuntu.com/questions/66533/how-can-i-restore-configuration-files
[20:37] <GabMus_> I have a problem with gnome shell, could someone here help me?
[20:37] <bfri> what_up i just pasted ur command and got nothing
[20:38] <WHAT_UP> bfri: hmm. then either maple did not install or was installed to a different directory
[20:38] <humberos>  NickServ identify dora05
[20:38] <bfri> what_up ok ill try to install again
[20:38] <pianoman> z_Chanshark no i read on the ubuntu support site that burning it as an iso was incorrect.
[20:38] <z_Chanshark> I have a problem with wifi can someone help me i cant get it to work because i need to use a ndiswrapper and there is the bug (#986064) is there a way around it
[20:39] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  you don't use it like a flashdrive
[20:39] <z_Chanshark> i burned it and it worked
[20:39] <pianoman> what did you do after you burned it?
[20:40] <z_Chanshark> ploped it in my diskdrive and restarted
[20:40] <pianoman> did you have to select a drive?
[20:40] <z_Chanshark> pianoman: i partishened a  space for it (15 tb)
[20:41] <z_Chanshark> wait pianoman  are you trying to duel boo
[20:41] <daftykins> pianoman: is your BIOS boot order correct?
[20:41] <z_Chanshark> *boot
[20:41] <pianoman> yes i'm trying to dual boot. and daftykins i'm not sure how to check that.
[20:41] <z_Chanshark> partision your hhd
[20:41] <daftykins> pianoman: is it a laptop/desktop ?
[20:41] <Eagleman> Slart i guess that worked :)
[20:41] <pianoman> laptop
[20:41] <z_Chanshark> give it like 10 gb
[20:42] <pianoman> partition the c drive?
[20:42] <z_Chanshark> yea
[20:42] <z_Chanshark> im quad-booting :D
[20:42] <daftykins> pianoman: most manufacturers, you hit F2 or delete whilst the brand logo / POST screen shows, then you look for boot options. sometimes there's a key like F8 or F10 to give you a boot device list instead of entering BIOS first
[20:42] <Slart> Eagleman: great =)
[20:43] <daftykins> pianoman: is Windows or whatever your other OS is, already present? if so, is it already installed to the full size of the drive, or have you installed it to a small partition?
[20:43] <z_Chanshark> its f11 for boot menu
[20:43] <pianoman> ok. i've got a huge c drive so that wouldn't be a problem. daftykins yeah i can get into there. once i'm there what do i do? and its present, and no its not to the full size. there is no other partition.
[20:44] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  how much space do you have fre
[20:44] <pianoman> and i hit f12 for mine. but yeah.
[20:44] <pianoman> like 400 gb
[20:44] <Eagleman> ANy good guides around for setting up an internet mail system with relay_agent ?
[20:44] <daftykins> pianoman: F12 give you a boot menu? with CD/DVD on the list?
[20:44] <pianoman> daftykins yes
[20:44] <sam555> daftykins: got it working!
[20:44] <orudie> hi. I just installed putty in ubuntu 12.04 . How can I start multiple putty sessions ?
[20:44] <daftykins> sam555: cool :)
[20:44] <orudie> similar to how it is in windows
[20:45] <daftykins> orudie: why would you use putty in Linux when SSH functionality is native and can be used from any terminal?
[20:45] <orudie> in putty application, I noticed that I can't right click - duplicate session
[20:45] <z_Chanshark> I have a problem with wifi can someone help me i cant get it to work because i need to use a ndiswrapper and there is the bug (#986064) is there a way around it
[20:45] <orudie> daftykins: I am new to ubuntu desktop. I need to be able to save sessions
[20:46] <MadN3ss> lol
[20:46] <limpc> hi I'm having trouble with ubuntu 12.10 - I upgraded my motherboard, and i see an error during boot up but can't catch what it is with - however, my usb keyboard/mouse die during ubuntu boot up.  (works in bios, but numlock light goes out as soon as ubuntu initializes)
[20:46] <daftykins> orudie: for what purpose?
[20:46] <daftykins> limpc: does a liveCD work?
[20:46] <z_Chanshark> limpc:  are they wireless
[20:46] <orudie> daftykins: need to be able to save SSH sesssions. We have many servers here
[20:46] <limpc> daftykins, it would probably work but I don't have a livecd
[20:46] <pianoman> daftykins whenever i get to the boot menu i can get ubuntu to get started but it doesn't finish correctly. is that partition needed for it to install correctly?
[20:47] <z_Chanshark> limpc:  is your mouse and keyboard wireless
[20:47] <limpc> z_Chanshark, no
[20:47] <limpc> they're usb as i said
[20:47] <z_Chanshark> i have a wireless usb mouse and keyboard
[20:47] <z_Chanshark> just saying
[20:47] <MadN3ss> is anyone else INLOVE with the new one direction CD?
[20:47] <daftykins> limpc: is it beyond the realms of possibility to make one, to help diagnose your problem?
[20:47] <MadN3ss> The boys are all grown up, and ohso sexy
[20:47] <limpc> I'm not using a dongle, its just direct usb.
[20:48] <daftykins> !offtopic | MadN3ss
[20:48] <DJones> MadN3ss: Wrong channel for that
[20:48] <ubottu> MadN3ss: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[20:48] <limpc> daftykins, no, i can make one, just wondering if theres a way to fix it without?
[20:48] <limpc> does ubuntu not detect new mb chipsets?
[20:48] <daftykins> limpc: well my first idea was to read logs from the boot process from a live system, sooo
[20:48] <MadN3ss> One directions supports Ubuntu. I'm not offtopic at all
[20:48] <MadN3ss> one direction and ubuntu go hand in hand
[20:48] <MadN3ss> read a book
[20:48] <daftykins> troll.
[20:49] <z_Chanshark> MadN3ss:  what do you mean?
[20:49] <MonkeyDust> MadN3ss  not here, please
[20:49] <pianoman> daftykins whenever i get to the boot menu i can get ubuntu to get started but it doesn't finish correctly. is that partition needed for it to install correctly?
[20:49] <z_Chanshark> im confused what just happened
[20:49] <MadN3ss> You guys are so hell bent over this being strictly ubuntu
[20:49] <daftykins> pianoman: is the screen blanking and failing to let you get to the ubuntu desktop?
[20:50] <MadN3ss> but even if it's related it not allowed?
[20:50] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  yes if you want to duel boot
[20:50] <MadN3ss> your topics are so misleading
[20:50] <MadN3ss> get over you and your geeky computer shit
[20:50] <WHAT_UP> i'm trying to netinstall using a dvd, but it's been stuck on "Retrieving block-modules-3.2.0-23-generic-pae-di" for a few minutes. I see online that this is a ~300k package, whereas my download speed is generally around 10 MB/s. What gives?
[20:50] <MonkeyDust> MadN3ss  type /join #ubuntu-offtopic
[20:50] <daftykins> MadN3ss: there's an offtopic channel. get over it and go away.
[20:50] <limpc> daftykins, like to determine what the problem is caused by? I'm 90% sure it's due to a different usb chipset.  but seeing as I can't even get to a command prompt I'm guessing I have to have a livecd anyway :/
[20:50] <DJones> MadN3ss: If you've got an Ubuntu support question, please ask it, general chat is in #ubuntu-offtopic
[20:50]  * MadN3ss hands daftykins a bridge
[20:50] <z_Chanshark> MadN3ss:  last time i checked your comment was not a question :D
[20:51] <MadN3ss> YOU GET OVER IT
[20:51] <MadN3ss> DO IT
[20:51] <Miebster> How can I mount a CIFS windows share without typing in a plaintext password into something?
[20:51] <pianoman> will it automatically detect it? and is 10 gb the most i'll need? or more?
[20:52] <daftykins> limpc: USB is a standard. the Linux kernel isn't gonna trip up over a motherboard swap unless there's a bug. if the install isn't fully up to date and there's a bug that's fixed, you could then update in a chroot from a liveCD / liveUSB flash drive
[20:52] <z_Chanshark> when first setting mine up i did 10 gb
[20:52] <limpc> daftykins, ah. yea thats what i was trying to get to a command line to do.  thanks, ill make a livecd
[20:52] <daftykins> Miebster: the general approach is to put that plaintext password into /root/.smbpass and chmod it so another user couldn't read it anyway. no alternative unless you make the share guest readable
[20:52] <z_Chanshark> when i installed it i did other install and did it manually
[20:53] <Steven4242> so I have linux installed.. but no ubuntu it is just terminal :/
[20:53] <daftykins> limpc: np!
[20:53] <pianoman> and this is all on windows 8 right/
[20:53] <pianoman> ?
[20:53] <Steven4242> well I have ubuntu but yeah
[20:53] <Steven4242> no desktop
[20:53] <jgodbout> How can I disable resume/hibernate on GRUB?
[20:53] <z_Chanshark> yes but you have to make sure you choose free space other wise you will delete windows 8
[20:53] <jgodbout> Is there a command like noresume for GRUB2?
[20:53] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  i suggest watch a tutorial on youtube if its your first time duel booting
[20:53] <limpc> Steven4242, did you install the server version of ubuntu?
[20:54] <daftykins> pianoman: ah if your windows 8 install is an EFI one, you may run into addition difficulty. you can check this if you boot into windows and run diskmgmt.msc
[20:54] <Miebster> daftykins: still insecure though right? anyone with access to the drive could get my password? or any admin on the machine?
[20:54] <Steven4242> limpc: well I selected Ubuntu Desktop in the installation screen
[20:54] <pianoman> can you direct me to an effecient video z_Chanshark?
[20:54] <daftykins> Miebster: they'd have to have root/sudo access
[20:54] <z_Chanshark> yea sure pianoman
[20:54] <pianoman> daftykins is that through command prompt?
[20:55] <usbu> can any one tell me how to change the read only permission of flash drives ?
[20:55] <pianoman> i'm kind of new to all this
[20:55] <daftykins> pianoman: nah it's a GUI app, diskmgmt.msc is the shortcut to type into the 'run' dialogue box
[20:55] <Steven4242> limpc: I did install using the minimal iso thingy so I could burn it to a CD though
[20:55] <pianoman> gotcha. i'll try it
[20:55] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  what version of ubuntu are you using?
[20:55] <pianoman> 12.10
[20:55] <ubuntu-tester> usbu: was it mounted read-only?
[20:55] <Miebster> daftykins: a live cd can read all of the files on the hard drive though?
[20:55] <z_Chanshark> 12.04 precise pangolin?
[20:55] <z_Chanshark> oh
[20:55] <Steven4242> when I press CTRL ALT F7 it shows just a yellow underscore that flashes
[20:56] <pianoman> will that make a big difference?
[20:56] <usbu> ubuntu-tester : I am using 12.04, it is not mounted
[20:56] <z_Chanshark> not really
[20:56] <pianoman> daftykins ok i ran it. what am i looking for?
[20:57] <ubuntu-tester> usbu: I mean flash drive
[20:57] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  just youtube and it look though the comments to see if its alot of good reviews
[20:57] <daftykins> pianoman: can you screenshot it and upload to an image hosting site like imgur.com ?
[20:57] <jgodbout> Is there a way to disable resume from hibernation from GRUB or otherwise? I cant boot after a failed hibernation..
[20:57] <winb> fucking chess.com fuck
[20:57] <pianoman> yes.
[20:57] <daftykins> Miebster: yep. depends how paranoid you are for someone booting up your system without your permission and finding it.
[20:57] <Tm_T> winb: please watch your language
[20:58] <usbu> ubuntu-tester:yeah.. its actually a memmory card, ihave been copying some files to it. i cancelled the process while copying. now I am unable to mount it.
[20:58] <pianoman> http://imgur.com/SBcgA
[20:58] <winb> Tm_T: wrong channel
[20:58] <usbu> ubuntu-tester : it says that you cant change the permission for read only file system
[20:58] <Steven4242> so do I need to install something if it just boots to the black screen?
[20:58] <Miebster> daftykins: well this is a company and every user will mount the drive this way, so it has to be secure or users could just hop on someones computer and get passwords
[20:59] <Steven4242> in terminal that is
[20:59] <z_Chanshark> pianoman:  pm me so i can give you the link
[20:59] <ubuntu-tester> usbu: so it was remounted read-only due to errors

[21:05] <daftykins> pianoman: what options come up if you right click on the part where it says 'Disk 0' ?
[21:05] <usbu> ubuntu-tester  :  and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:     e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
[21:05] <daftykins> Miebster: i know of none that include authentication
[21:05] <ubuntu-tester> usbu: do you know filesystem on usb drive?
[21:06] <pianoman> .the only available options it gives me is convert to dynamic disc, properties, or help
[21:06] <daftykins> Miebster: actually, the old 'connect to server' style would store passwords in the keyring i believe. you don't get filesystem level access to those types of shares though =/

[21:07] <usbu> ubuntu-tester  : earlier it was FAT. but i tried to format it using different filesystems ext4,ext2 and fat32, none of them worked. At present I don't know in format the usb is.. :)
[21:08] <pianoman> what should i do now
[21:08] <ubuntu-tester> usbu: do you care about the remaining data on it?
[21:08] <daftykins> pianoman: you've not got any space for an Ubuntu install right now though. you'd need to maybe delete that 19.53GB 'OEM' partition - if you don't mind losing the laptop's restore functionality

[21:09] <C-T-N> i will get a ssd soon, i noticed that i must set up ubuntu for it. is it difficult?
[21:09] <OerHeks> Snicers-Work, time to upgrade that 2,5 year old version, or you can use old-versions update, but that is unsafe, you won't get the latest security updates
[21:09] <ubuntu-tester> usbu: if not, i suggest you reformat it with your camera
[21:09] <OerHeks> Snicers-Work, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[21:09] <daftykins> C-T-N: enabling TRIM should be pretty simple
[21:10] <C-T-N> it is just TRIM or does I need to set up something else?
[21:10] <C-T-N> *is it
[21:10] <daftykins> C-T-N: nothing i know of off hand
[21:10] <usbu> ubuntu-tester : You mean from the device ? It was in my android phone. Now it say no sd card detected :(
[21:10] <pianoman> what does that oem partition do? and i tried to make one and the program said that i needed to change one partition from logical to something else
[21:11] <C-T-N> ok
[21:11] <daftykins> pianoman: likely it lets you hit another function key on boot to restore the preinstalled Windows drive to factory fresh if something breaks
[21:12] <ubuntu-tester> usbu: so you tried to format it to FAT and it didn't work?
[21:12] <pianoman> ok. so what does the other partition for ubuntu need to be?
[21:12] <usbu> ubuntu-tester : Yeah. From both windows and Ubuntu.
[21:12] <C-T-N> can someone tell me a great iso burner on ubuntu? I don't need much settings..only burn :P
[21:12] <daftykins> pianoman: you just need to make space on the drive to install it, once you boot the CD/DVD

[21:17] <ubuntu-tester> usbu: you can determine damaged area somehow, and partition the card so filesystem won't intersect with that area
[21:17] <daftykins> pianoman: when you first boot from the CD/DVD, do you get a menu? try choosing the 'check disc for defects' option if so

[21:50] <orudie> TheLordOfTime: I did install putty. I can't even run two putty windows at the same time. There is no option in linux version of putty to "duplicate session" when you right click the top bar.
[21:50] <TheLordOfTime> probably not as up to date as your windows version but...
[21:50] <orudie> ubottu: ^^
[21:51] <TheLordOfTime> orudie, don't ping ubottu, she's a bot.
[21:51] <TheLordOfTime> orudie, as i said, that may be in a newer version than is on linux
[21:51] <TheLordOfTime> s/linux/ubuntu/
[21:51] <orudie> i installed putty from the package manager
[21:52] <orudie> the problem that I have with putty on ubuntu 12.04 is that I can't run more than one putty session at the same time.
[21:53] <orudie> and putty doesn't work the same way it works in windows for copy+pasting
[21:54] <daftykins> welcome to OS != Windows.
[21:54] <unreal82> need recommendation for xubuntu 12.04 proprietary driver. GPU is Geforce 620. I have options in jockey of the NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (post-release updates), or experimental versions 304 and 310.
[21:55] <daftykins> unreal82: whichever you have the nerve to try. more recent if you're gaming would be best
[21:55] <jgodbout> My laptop is failing to boot after trying to hibernate, with the error ¨resume: could not stat resume device file /dev/dm-0¨  (12.04). I have tried booting in recovery mode and reformatting my swap space.
[21:56] <unreal82> daftykins: thanks, I don't game. I want better resolution.
[21:56] <jgodbout> Any ideas?
[21:56] <Eagleman> I am unable to reach mail.FQDN.tld ( using a mail client ) from inside my network ( the fqdn is also in my network ), however outside my network this works fine. nslookup on both hosts shows the same ip address. I can also ping and do tracert, everything works fine except on my mail client. Any idea what could be the issue ?
[21:56] <IOmegaZ> hi
[21:57] <guntbert> alami: support for virtualbox is to be found in #vbox
[21:57] <daftykins> jgodbout: if you hold down left shift at boot to get the GRUB menu stuffs, do you see anything relevant?
=== jhutchins_wk is now known as jhutchins
[21:58] <IOmegaZ> ubuntu installer An Error occured list index out of range for more information,please see the log file
[21:58] <IOmegaZ> i keep getting
[21:58] <orudie> I mean what do you guys do when you have to connect to many differet servers via ssh all the time?
[21:58] <escott> orudie, ~/.ssh/config
[21:59] <bekks> orudie: I just use ssh hostname :)
[21:59] <daftykins> orudie: edit my /etc/hosts file to add IPs to friendly hostnames (if i can't ssh via hostname) then just type ssh user@host in terminals
[21:59] <IOmegaZ> hi
[21:59] <IOmegaZ> i got a probllem
[22:00] <daftykins> IOmegaZ: please don't repeat it too often as it'll anger me and kill small kittens in the process
[22:00] <orudie> yeah but i don't want to even type ssh user@host that's too much work
[22:00] <daftykins> IOmegaZ: your best first step is to work out how to access the install log and post it online for someone to read
[22:01] <orudie> securecrt is a paid ssh client which has very nice ssh sessions management
[22:01] <jgodbout> daftykins: Nothing interesting. Left shift just shows the grub menu right?
[22:01] <machicola> running Ubuntu 12.10, what is the preferred way to have a startup script, which launches some programs and performs some file operations, initialize after GDM is loaded regardless of the session I've chosen at the login screen
[22:01] <daftykins> orudie: then it sounds like you need to either get googling for an alternative, consider creating aliases, or give up.
[22:01] <orudie> you can store hundreds of ssh connections there
[22:01] <jhutchins> orudie: Create a config file.
[22:01] <jhutchins> orudie: You can install putty.
[22:01] <daftykins> jgodbout: yeah, i wondered if maybe the boot options on the default had some extra fields that tell it to look for the resume image that you could delete to make it ignore that
[22:02] <ubuntu-tester> orudie: so you came here to advertise securecrt?
[22:02] <bekks> orudie: You can do the same using putty, e.g.
[22:02] <machicola> I would like it to run on top of all of the normal boot processes, it seems like using .xsession is requiring me to initialize other basic processes
[22:02] <escott> orudie, just modify your ssh config file. really not that hard. ~/.ssh/config
[22:02] <orudie> can't run two putty sessions at the same time in ubuntu is my biggest problem with putty for ubuntu
[22:02] <jhutchins> orudie: With the conf file you still have to do ssh foo, but you can also configure icons as ssh links.
[22:02] <escott> orudie, http://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config
[22:02] <jhutchins> orudie: ?
[22:02] <jrib> machicola: what sort of things do you want to run?
[22:02] <jhutchins> orudie: Why not?
[22:03] <Miebster> how do the mount commands and adding things to fstab differ?
[22:03] <IOmegaZ> ok
[22:03] <jgodbout> daftykins: I tried adding no_console_suspend to the boot options, but that didnt seem to do anything either
[22:03] <IOmegaZ> how can i post my log file?
[22:03] <orudie> because it doesn't start
[22:03] <orudie> only one starts
[22:03] <IOmegaZ> how can i post my log file?
[22:03] <daftykins> Miebster: fstab is permanent, mount is single user one time mount
[22:03] <jrib> Miebster: one is a command and the other is a file with settings in it?
[22:03] <orudie> can't right click - duplicate session
[22:03] <machicola> jrib: just some applications, start up the terminal, move some files around and do a little clean up

[22:03] <orudie> like you can in putty for windows
[22:03] <escott> Miebster, fstab allows unpriv users to mount entries in the fstab otherwise unpriv users cannot mount
[22:03] <jhutchins> Miebster: THe syntax is different; items in fstab can be made to mount automatically at boot.
[22:03] <Miebster> how can I make mounts permanent, without putting them in fstab, since you have to put your password in the command
[22:03] <daftykins> jgodbout: that sounds more like 'don't suspent in future'. can you boot to CLI access?
[22:04] <jhutchins> orudie: So just launch another one.
[22:04] <Bjarte> okay, um, I actually got a simple beginner-level C question. What's the difference between alignof and sizeof? I feel like they're the same but for structs they're not. for unions, they are.
[22:04] <jgodbout> daftykins: Nope, it stops with the error message before then.
[22:04] <escott> Miebster, you mean a password for something like samba?
[22:04] <daftykins> Miebster: you can't. did you look into the GUI 'connect to server' i mentioned?
[22:04] <jrib> machicola: if you can use the Startup Applications gui, I would suggest that.  It creates .desktop files in ~/.config/autostart.  You can also use ~/.xprofile or ~/.xsessionrc instead.
[22:04] <Miebster> escott: yeah
[22:04] <daftykins> jgodbout: ah :(
[22:04] <MonkeyDust> Miebster  fstab is the way to make mounts permanent
[22:04] <jhutchins> IOmegaZ: You can READ the log file and see why it's stopping.
[22:04] <Miebster> daftykins: no i missed that
[22:05] <escott> Miebster, you could see if you can specify the password not in fstab but by reference to a file in /etc and then restrict permissions on that file
[22:05] <guntbert> Bjarte: this channel is for ubuntu support - you might get answers in ##c
[22:05] <alami> why i get this error after run apt-get update http://pastebin.com/dW2DcvS3
[22:05] <daftykins> jgodbout: in google results people refer to removing the package 'uswusp' - you could do that in your current install by chroot'ing from a livecd
[22:05] <jgodbout> daftykins: Sweet, i
[22:05] <Bjarte> guntbert: I asked there. Nobody answered xD. Plus I usually come here since I do use #ubuntu so I gave this channel a try.
[22:05] <Bjarte> :|
[22:05] <z_Chanshark> yea daftykins  i went to both irc's and litterer they are both dead silent
[22:05] <jgodbout> daftykins: ill try that. also, this seems to be the exact problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1997933
[22:05] <bekks> alami: Because you added duplicates of sources?
[22:05] <Miebster> Can't I just run the mount command when the user logs in?
[22:06] <bekks> Miebster: Only using pam_mount
[22:06] <daftykins> Miebster: you're still gonna need to pass a password.
[22:06] <MonkeyDust> alami  a mix of i386 and amd64 sources may be conflicting
[22:06] <Miebster> I'm just blown away there isn't a way to do this, this seems like a very common thing
[22:07] <daftykins> jgodbout: do you also have another Linux install present, so there's another swap partition somewhere else?
[22:07] <alami> bekks: i havn't add any one i thing ubuntu software Center is dowing that
[22:07] <bekks> Miebster: In the last 10 years, I've only seen 3 people using it.
[22:07] <coldguatemalan> hi all, so i got a sever with one ip set yet i just discovered that it responds to another ip i had no idea about. i'm baffled has anyone experienced such a thing?
[22:07] <jgodbout> daftykins: I made the swap partition that iḿ using now from a previous install, then i installed 12.04 over that previous install partition, keeping the old swap partition.
[22:07] <bekks> coldguatemalan: Just take a look at ifconfig -a
[22:07] <daftykins> coldguatemalan: yes, if IP forwarding is enabled, a host can reply from a second IP if it has another network interface.
[22:07] <alami> bekks: how can i delate it?
[22:07] <jgodbout> daftykins: i have already tried formatting that swap partition again, though.
[22:07] <Miebster> Okay, what do people normaly do when they need to connect to a smba share, and they want it to be connected when they log in?
[22:08] <syncsys> cannot set JAVA_HOME in /etc/enviroment  with JAVA_HOME="/home/syncsys/bin/jdk1.7.0_10/"    echo give me that but its not a correct java home or i need something else?
[22:08] <machicola> jrib, I was trying to do it via the command line only or without actually using the startup apps gui...I've tried it with .xsession and some weird thing is happening, it seems like basic processes aren't coming up which is making me wonder whether with .xsession GDM and some other things need to be started manually
[22:08] <bekks> alami: By editing the sources.
[22:08] <alami> okay
[22:08] <jgodbout> daftykins: im booting off a live CD now, and ill try to remove that package
[22:08] <coldguatemalan> bekks i have two interfaces bonded with only one ip
[22:08] <jrib> machicola: so try the two files I suggested?  You can use them and log-in with gdm
[22:08] <daftykins> jgodbout: it might be that your install's /etc/fstab is referring to the swap drive wrong, seems to be thoughts i get from google results too
[22:08] <limpc> daftykins, i got my livedcd (usb), but ubuntu doesn't load when i boot to it
[22:08] <limpc> usb does not work on it either
[22:08] <machicola> ok, thanks jrib
[22:09] <machicola> jrib: so all of these files are configured to work differently?
[22:09] <daftykins> limpc: if you're sure those boot devices work, could be your hardware has an issue with the version of the kernel on the liveCD/USB
[22:09] <Niyakun> can the newest ubuntu run under windows 8 using wubi?
[22:09] <jrib> machicola: what do you mean?
[22:09] <bekks> Miebster: They use LDAP and pam_mount
[22:09] <daftykins> Niyakun: i would highly recommend never even thinking of using WUBI
[22:09] <limpc> its ubuntu 12.10, and isn't the kernel supposed to be generic?
[22:09] <machicola> i mean, the way .xsession is running the script/code will be different from the way .xsessionrc or .xprofile will?
[22:10] <daftykins> limpc: sure but kernels have bugs sometimes. try googling with your motherboard model / chipset
[22:10] <jrib> machicola: yes.
[22:10] <machicola> ok, thanks
[22:10] <jhutchins> Strange. something is blocking ad-block
[22:10] <daftykins> limpc: the other option is trying to get logs from your boot, try an older ubuntu perhaps? to see if that boots
[22:10] <Miebster> bekks: Im reading pam_mounts about and it sounds like it was made for odd cases, how is a generic somba mount require this 3rd party tool?
[22:10] <jgodbout> daftykins: ill look at my fstab and see if anything looks funny
[22:10] <jrib> machicola: you usually use .xsession as your actual session.  .xprofile and .xsessionrc just get executed sometime after you login with whatever session you are using
[22:10] <limpc> i can't even get to shell
[22:10] <limpc> usb keyboard dies when ubuntu initializes
[22:11] <bekks> Miebster: It isnt a 3rd party tool :)
[22:11] <limpc> ill see if i can find an old ps2 keyboard :/
[22:11] <daftykins> jgodbout: ja if it doesn't use UUIDs, perhaps the disk 'letters' have changed
[22:11] <daftykins> PS/2 for the win.
[22:11] <machicola> jrib, ahh very helpful, ok thanks
[22:11] <Niyakun> daftykins: it is a laptop and i cannot afford to partition the current ntfs partition
[22:11] <Niyakun> which has data*
[22:12] <diparikh> doublehelix
[22:12] <daftykins> Niyakun: how come?
[22:12] <Miebster> bekks: how is it not 3rd party?
[22:13] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: why not to put it to fstab?
[22:13] <Miebster> ubuntu-tester: that would put password in plain text
[22:13] <escott> Miebster, pam is the core authentication/permission tool in linux
[22:13] <Miebster> escott: I'm lost this conversation is going in circles, everyone says this is easy but no one has given a solution
[22:13] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: and where do you expect to store it?
=== Prodego is now known as Prodeseer
[22:14] <Miebster> I have a central server with shared samba drives.  How can I get users to mount to the drive, without putting their password in plain text, and having the mount persist through restart?
=== syncsys is now known as Quest
[22:14] <escott> Miebster, is it possible to specify the password in a file. something like mount -t cifs -permission-file /some/path/to/file/with/username_and_password
[22:15] <daftykins> escott: he knows but doesn't want to do that
[22:15] <bekks> Miebster: Because the package is named libpam-mount and is provided by the stock ubuntu repos?
[22:15] <daftykins> bekks: what is the method you're suggesting Miebster try? i'm curious.
[22:15] <jrib> Miebster: just out of curiousity, what is the reason to not want the password in plaintext?
[22:15] <Quest> cannot set JAVA_HOME in /etc/enviroment  with JAVA_HOME="/home/syncsys/bin/jdk1.7.0_10/"    echo give me that but its not a correct java home or i need something else?
[22:15] <bekks> daftykins: Using LDAP and pam_mount
[22:16] <Miebster> jrib: because then anyone with access to the machine (Every employee) can find anyones password
[22:16] <daftykins> bekks: does that assume there's an LDAP backend?
[22:16] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: I see, but you have to put it somewhere. Windows also put it somewhere, obfuscated though
[22:16] <bekks> daftykins: Of course.
[22:16] <Miebster> ubuntu-tester: puts it somewhere, not in plain text though
[22:16] <jrib> Miebster: why?
[22:16] <escott> Miebster, if you can put the password in a file and lockdown the file thats not a problem
[22:16] <jrib> Miebster: you can just use regular permissions to solve that problem, no?
[22:16] <daftykins> Miebster: what is the host that you're authenticating these users to running, windows AD?
[22:16] <Miebster> jrib: live cd?
[22:17] <jrib> Miebster: that's a different concern.
[22:17] <Miebster> daftykins: just windows server? not sure what are you asking?
[22:17] <jrib> Miebster: but ok, carry on :)
[22:17] <Miebster> jrib: pretty normal concern to not put passwords in plaintext
[22:17] <daftykins> Miebster: i'm asking if it's a Windows domain or just file server role
[22:17] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: do you want to hide it from *that* user, who uses it?
[22:18] <daftykins> jrib: i tried to say the standard course of action is to hide the smbpass file from the users but apparently Miebster's users all boot alternative OS's and read each others passwords for fun
=== Jarek is now known as Guest46575
[22:18] <Miebster> ubuntu-tester: the user is the one that types it in, I want to hide it from everyone else, and in general, a password should never be on screen
[22:18] <Quest> ow to eliminate the need to restart again and again after /etc/enviroment updations
[22:18] <blami> Quest: just logout and login
[22:19] <Quest> blami,  any other way?
[22:19] <blami> Quest: /etc/environment gets sourced every time you run login shell
[22:19] <Quest> blami,  hm is there any other way?
[22:19] <blami> Quest: not for whole graphical session
[22:19] <escott> Quest, you cannot (easily) change the environment of a running process
[22:19] <Miebster> daftykins: I'm blown away that I'm being treated odd for this, linux has always been about superior security, and now we store password in plain text
[22:19] <Quest> escott,  i did that once. i just lost the tutorial
[22:19] <jrib> Miebster: you could also just encrypt the drive ubuntu is on.  Which you probably should be doing if you're concerned about people fetching data from the drive using a live cd
[22:20] <blami> Quest: because only running process can change it's own environment
[22:20] <jrib> Miebster: I think you're asking a fair question.  I just wanted to make sure I understood your needs
[22:20] <Miebster> jrib: there is no data on the machines we care about, everything is on a server, so I could care 2 cents if you hacked into the machine, until you can auth with the server you dont have anythign
[22:20] <blami> Quest: if you need your changes being sourced only in single terminal window you can do . /etc/environment
[22:20] <blami> hm
[22:20] <jgodbout> daftykins: http://pastebin.com/MTZjycRS  - my fstab file. gparted lists /dev/sda5 as a 4GB linux-swap
=== syncsys is now known as Quest
[22:20] <Quest> back
[22:21] <daftykins> Miebster: Linux users don't tend to be mounting from a windows box sadly.
[22:21] <jrib> Miebster: was pam_mount not suitable?  I'm not familiar with it myself
[22:21] <Miebster> jrib: not sure how to use it
[22:21] <daftykins> jgodbout: oh it's encrypted? 0o
[22:21] <blami> Miebster: that's why /etc/shadow is there
[22:21] <jgodbout> daftykins: Oh, I didnt know. that would explain why hibernation failed huh
=== Prodeseer is now known as Prodewolf
[22:22] <daftykins> jgodbout: i'm only really assuming. can you pastebin 'sudo fdisk -l' too?
[22:22] <Miebster> blami: can I use that do accomplish this?
[22:22] <riderplus> i have no sound in 13.04...i saw that bug, but couldn't fix it
[22:22] <daftykins> jgodbout: since the fstab there uses /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 as the mount location
[22:22] <riderplus> how can i restore the sound?
[22:22] <escott> jgodbout, daftykins if you selected encrypted home at install you get encrypted swap which probably breaks hibernation
[22:23] <daftykins> riderplus: distros that haven't been released yet are talked about in #ubuntu+1
[22:23] <Slart> riderplus: isn't there a channel dedicated to 13.04, #ubuntu+1 perhaps?
[22:23] <blami> Miebster: sorry I havent read backlog ... just your complaint about fulltext password
[22:23] <jgodbout> escott: Yeah,i encrypted myhome dir.
[22:23] <jrib> Miebster: one alternative is to just give the users an encrypted directory and put the credentials file in there, no?
[22:23] <daftykins> Slart: ^5
[22:23] <daftykins> escott: ah-ha. thanks
[22:23] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: see http://askubuntu.com/questions/157128/proper-fstab-entry-to-mount-a-samba-share-on-boot
[22:23] <Slart> daftykins: I have to oil my keyboard if I'm going to keep up with you guys =)
[22:23] <escott> jgodbout, you are going to have to pick one of the other. suspend is fine, but hibernate is not going to support encryption
[22:23] <level> hi
[22:23] <level> :)
[22:24] <z_Chanshark> daftykins: i think i figured it out for mint users / ubuntu users :D
[22:24] <blami> escott: why?
[22:24] <daftykins> z_Chanshark: :O
[22:24] <daftykins> z_Chanshark: do tell
[22:24] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: answer from russnash
[22:24] <escott> blami, no secure location for the key when the cpu halts
[22:24] <Miebster> ubuntu-tester: it wont load
=== jhutchins_wk is now known as jhutchins
[22:24] <blami> escott: I have lvm on luks and hibernates just fine
[22:24] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: ?
[22:24] <jgodbout> escott: I dont need to hibernate. I just cant boot after i tried to hibernate.
[22:24] <blami> escott: yes, that's correct. I have passphrase stored in laptop's tpm store
[22:24] <escott> blami, thats full disk. and you presumably give the key to the bootloader
[22:24] <Miebster> ubuntu-tester: that hyperlink doens't load
[22:25] <apfor> i
[22:25] <jgodbout> escott: I dont need to be able to hibernate in the future, i usually just suspend to ram
[22:25] <blami> escott: no I just unlock tpm store using smartcard token
[22:25] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: hmm, works for me...
[22:25] <z_Chanshark> ok so apparently broadcom package drivers work with the netgear thingy adapter only v2 tho so all i need to do is go into the package manager and download the broadcom package
[22:25] <escott> blami, effectively the same
[22:25] <blami> escott: then my random passphrase is passed to cryptsetup
[22:25] <blami> escott: yes
[22:26] <daftykins> jgodbout: if i were you i'd try the sadistic approach of removing the swap mount and seeing if boot cries about something else / doesn't error :D
[22:26] <escott> jgodbout, i would see if there is a way you can direct the system to boot without using the hibernate image
[22:26] <blami> jgodbout: suspending to ram isn't very wise with encrypted harddrive
[22:26] <Miebster> ubuntu-tester: that uses a plain text password
[22:26] <jgodbout> daftykins: escott: http://pastebin.com/CsjRbD91  sudo fdisk -l
[22:27] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: i've copied the main part: http://pastebin.com/tVX7U84s
[22:27] <daftykins> jgodbout: did you select an enctypted /home as escott mentioned?
[22:27] <daftykins> *encrypted
[22:27] <mdel> hey all - how can I re-evaluate the rules in /etc/security/access.conf?
[22:27] <jgodbout> escott: i tried finding grub options to boot without resuming. daftykins also suggested removing uswsusp from a live cd
[22:27] <escott> daftykins, he indicated he had
[22:27] <jgodbout> daftykins: yes i encrypted my /home
[22:27] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: password is hidden from anyone but root
[22:27] <escott> jgodbout, when you say it doesnt boot what exactly happens on boot
[22:28] <jgodbout> daftykins: when i tried hibernating, i didn realise that it didnt work if you encrypted it. ill know for the future
[22:28] <z_Chanshark> daftykins:  but apparently linux drivers will never be built for it because they are working on ones that are more advanced
[22:28] <escott> jgodbout, i dont think it should even be able to see the hibernation image and should just boot fresh
[22:29] <jgodbout> escott: it shows the ubuntu loading screen (with the 5 dots), and stays there. if i boot in recovery mode, it has the error shown here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1997933
=== truexfan404 is now known as truexfan81
[22:29] <Miebster> ubuntu-tester: its still stored in plaintext, livecd = password stolen
[22:29] <daftykins> jgodbout: probably buried in their release notes :S
[22:29] <daftykins> escott: ah my bad, i'm channel hopping too much
[22:29] <bekks> Miebster: It isnt.
[22:29] <ogist> hi
[22:29] <bekks> Miebster: Encrypt your box -> livecd useless.
[22:30] <Miebster> bekks: the boxes are not encrypted
[22:30] <jgodbout> escott: i dont get a command line or anything when i ctrlalt+f1
[22:30] <escott> jgodbout, i wonder if the hibernation write did something nasty to the cryptswap device
[22:30] <bekks> Miebster: Then encrypt them when fearing someone can use a livecd.
[22:30] <Miebster> The main point here is I can do this with NFS, but not SAMBA?
[22:31] <bekks> Miebster: Only using pam_mount and an LDAP backend.
[22:31] <jrib> Miebster: how do you do it with nfs?
[22:31] <Miebster> bekks: your suggestion is useless, you are telling me to reinstall the OS on everymachine because of a limitation in samba mounts
[22:31] <bekks> Miebster: It is no limitation of samba mounts when YOU are fearing someone can use a livecd to steal your data.
[22:31] <Miebster> jrib: for NFS I just put it in the fstab, no password, no username, and it works since it auths automatically
[22:31] <Miebster> bekks: wrong, it is a limitation with SAMBA mounts in linux, this works in windows (no passwords entered) and works with NFS in linux (no passwords entered)
[22:31] <bekks> Miebster: Since WHEN does NFS auths itself automagically against what?
[22:31] <Rienzilla> hmm
[22:31] <jgodbout> escott: shall i try creating a new swap partition and using that?
[22:32] <z_Chanshark> well im off, bye
[22:32] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: same on win, i should note. then go the way shown by bekks (LDAP etc,)
[22:32] <escott> jgodbout, i would try to boot a livecd and create the cryptswap device and then mkswap that device (if you can) alternately zero out the underlying swap device partition and try to recreate the swap device when booting
[22:32] <bekks> NFS3 implements NO security auth at all, and NFS4 requires a kerberos backend.
[22:32] <Miebster> bekks: for NFS I put this in my fstab server.local:/home/nfs/foo /opt/foo nfs user,exec,nolock 0 0
[22:32] <escott> jgodbout, this should explain how to do it http://hydra.geht.net/tino/howto/linux/cryptswap/
[22:33] <bekks> Thats NFS3 without any authentication.,
=== puff` is now known as puff
[22:33] <bekks> Everyone could access that share.
[22:33] <jgodbout> escott: ok thanks, iĺl try thatand report back
[22:33] <Miebster> bekks: if the user doens't have auth they get denied
[22:33] <bekks> Miebster: Using NFS3, there is no auth at all.
[22:34] <bekks> Miebster: Do you have a kerberos server for authentication? If no, you are using NFS3 and NO auth at all.
[22:37] <bekks> Miebster: So I take this as you should redesign your entire non-existing security concept.
[22:38] <Miebster> bekks: you have this asusmption that I have anything to do with the backend, I'm not sure how it works, I know that in windows it uses your credentials you used when you logged in to the domain
[22:38] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: put it simple: if password is stored somewhere locally, it can be stolen. you have only two other options: a) enter it every time; and b) store it in some TRUSTED place (that means strong auth etc.)
[22:39] <ubuntu-tester> Miebster: yes, domain is that same trusted third party
[22:39] <Miebster> ubuntu-tester: on windows the password isn't stored, you auth to the domain and then when you access the drives the server checks if you are authed to the domain
[22:39] <bekks> Miebster: Which is a local authentication and it requires to have the SAME credentials on ALL computers. Using an Active Directory, you have a CENTRAL administration, which eases up administration heavily in terms of security.
[22:39] <bekks> And the password IS stored, in Windows.
[22:40] <nineteensixty> is there a 12.10 for i7 the download only seems to to amd64
[22:40] <bekks> NTSAM.DAT or something like that contains all local accounts and can be easily hacked.
[22:40] <jgodbout> escott: That page is a bit too complicated for me to follow. Is there a simpler way to do that? Can we just delete the swap file to get rid of the hibernation data?
=== szx` is now known as szx
[22:40] <escott> jgodbout, thats basically what im suggesting. but if you have encrypted home so you should have encrypted swap
[22:41] <xangua> !amd64 | nineteensixty
[22:41] <ubottu> nineteensixty: AMD64 and Intel 64 are fully supported architectures on Ubuntu. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions#AMD64_Processors and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64 for more information.
[22:42] <escott> nineteensixty, amd64 is the name for the 64bit arch made by intel b/c amd came up with it first
[22:43] <OerHeks> intel made ia64, wich wasn't succesfull, because it was not compatible with 32 bit instructions
[22:44] <nineteensixty> I'm getting: This kernel requires an x86-64 CPU but only detected an i686 CPU
[22:44] <escott> then either it is not an i7 or you are running in a virtual environment
[22:44] <bekks> nineteensixty: Thats pretty clear. You need a 32bit kernel or a 64bit CPU.
[22:45] <nineteensixty> you'd think so wouldn't you!
[22:45] <blkadder> And if you are running in a virtual make sure you have support enabled in BIOS.
[22:45] <bekks> nineteensixty: Ensure you created a 64bit VM, not a 32bit one.
[22:46] <nineteensixty> Ah that may be why
[22:47] <nineteensixty> Which I probably can't do with the free Microsoft Virtual PC
[22:47] <bekks> Which you can do.
[22:47] <blkadder> Dunno but Virtualbox works fine.
[22:47] <demonio1> hi all, can anyone tell me where are source files write in c about program as "rm" "mv" ls etc
[22:47] <blkadder> I am using it now.
[22:47] <demonio1> ?
[22:47] <bekks> demonio1: You have to install the source packages.
[22:47] <escott> !info coreutils-dev
[22:47] <ubottu> Package coreutils-dev does not exist in quantal
[22:48] <wolftune> Anybody know if there exists a KDE plasma panel widget to do something like the Unity thing where the active window's title bar and buttons are shown in the panel?
[22:48] <escott> demonio1, it would be coreutils package, source can be got from gnu.org
[22:48] <jrib> demonio1: or just « apt-get source coreutils »

[22:50] <demonio1> sorry maybe i did wrong i want se files system write in c
[22:50] <jgodbout> daftykins: escott: ok i just deleted my swap partition, and now running boot-repair
[22:50] <Steven4242> my wireless network just says "device not ready"
[22:50] <jrib> demonio1: you want to see the C source code, yes?
[22:50] <demonio1> jrib yes
[22:51] <jrib> demonio1: so did you run « apt-get source coreutils » ?  It will place a directory in your current directory
[22:51] <blkadder> Steven4242: Are you certain you are running a supported device?
[22:51] <demonio1> jrib and then ?
[22:51] <jrib> demonio1: and then you read it
[22:52] <Steven4242> blkadder:  how do I find that out? when I was running 12.04 I was connected and had no problems.. just 12.10 is causing problems
[22:52] <Quest>  please see this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14287501/java-home-in-etc-enviroment-in-ubuntu    any help?
[22:53] <demonio1> jrib ok i'll try thanks :)
[22:53] <blkadder> If it was running previously then it is likely to be supported. What type of device is it?
[22:53] <jrib> Quest: why don't you install java through the repositories?
[22:53] <Steven4242> how do you enable a network device?
[22:54] <Quest> jrib,  i will still need to setup home
[22:54] <Quest> java home *
[22:54] <escott> Quest, its inappropriate for /etc/env to reference the home dir of a user
[22:54] <Steven4242> in my network settings it just says Wireless then underneath it Unavailable
[22:54] <Quest> escott, despite it says $ echo $JAVA_HOME
[22:54] <Quest> /home/syncsys/bin/jdk1.7.0_10
[22:55] <jrib> Quest: if you need to setup JAVA_HOME you can do that
[22:55] <Quest> jrib, how
[22:55] <jrib> Quest: the way you're doing it now
[22:55] <jrib> Quest: well some of it anyway.
[22:55] <escott> Quest, i didnt say it wouldnt work. i said it was inappropriate
[22:55] <blkadder> ifup but the drivers need to be loaded for it to work.
[22:55] <Quest> jrib,  if you read the link i gave. it says. $ java -version
[22:55] <Quest> The program 'java' can be found in the following packages:
[22:55] <Quest>  * default-jre
[22:55] <jrib> Quest: I read it
[22:55] <Quest> then why it says like that
[22:56] <Quest> escott,  ok.
[22:56] <blkadder> What specific wifi device are you running?
[22:56] <jrib> Quest: I recommend you install java through the repositories.  Then return here if you still have issues.
[22:56] <Quest> escott,  so whats wrong . why its not working
[22:56] <jrib> !java | Quest
[22:56] <ubottu> Quest: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[22:56] <ChrisWere> I've come accross yet another bug in ubuntu, surprise surprise, we logitech c15 webcam doesn't work with guvcview. Anyone know how to fix this?
[22:56] <Quest> jrib,  escott  i have done it before. repos also need to setup java home. its the same.
[22:56] <escott> Quest, if you installed java to a users home folder you should specify that in their ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc
[22:56] <Steven4242> Is there a command I can type in terminal to tell me what wifi card I have?
[22:57] <jrib> Quest: well you haven't installed it through the repositories this time, it looks like.
[22:57] <ubuntu-tester> Steven4242: try lspci |grep -i wireless
[22:57] <blkadder> Try lspci
[22:58] <Quest> jrib,  trust me. its the same
[22:58] <Steven4242> 03:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR9287 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express) (rev 01)
[22:58] <jrib> Quest: it's not :/
[23:00] <blkadder> Steven4242: Now go google that card + Ubuntu. :-)
[23:00] <blkadder> Looks like support is a bit flaky for it.
[23:00] <jrib> Quest: for one, if you use a nice package from the repositories, you won't have to deal with java not being in your path.  I don't use java and I don't know if you still need to set JAVA_HOME.  But you can do that if you want (use /etc/environment like you are now)
[23:01] <disharmonic> New card? i thought atheros is more or less a safe bet

I was wondering if there's some conflict with dual booting and encrypted lvm. I am using two separate hard drives, one for each os.
[23:17] <uponatree> blkadder: guess your link is how to create a new server certificat, but i want to authentificate devices with their own certificates

[23:17] <uponatree> blkadder: like in windows network policy server
[23:17] <daftykins> jgodbout: sounds good! my pleasure, sorry we couldn't get there.
[23:18] <escott> unreal82, the only issue i can think of is if /boot is inside the lvm then you would need to provide the password to see the menu item to boot windows
[23:18] <diverdude> Is there an edsitor that can access a file via ftp, and edit it and save it directly to the ftp location again?
[23:18] <unreal82> no, it's outside. I wouldn't encrypt the /boot.
[23:19] <escott> diverdude, there is probably a fuse ftp filesystem module you can use and then use any editor you want
[23:19] <blkadder> uponatree: You need to create the cert then install them on the client systems in order to auth.

[23:36] <stueng> dr_willis yeah
[23:36] <dr_willis> stueng:  i belive if you select uinity 2d at the login screen it changes your .dmrc and after that startx will default to unity2d
[23:36] <dr_willis> stueng:  you can check the unity-2d.desktop filein the x sessions directory to see what command it runs also
[23:37] <stueng> ok thats great but unfortuenly I need to know how to do it from the command line
[23:37] <Feedhurley> ubuntu-tester i have read the first link ubottu gave me but do not know really what i should do with folders like /media/windows

[23:40] <stueng> im busy setting up freenx.. messing with different sessions
[23:40] <ubuntu-tester> *partition, of the two
[23:40] <dr_willis> stueng:  whats the exact lines you put in your .xinitrc? actially its .Xsession i think these days
[23:40] <Feedhurley> ubuntu-tester did you see the link? (a photo there of my new formated disk, holding ext4 and ntfs).
[23:41] <zykotick9> dr_willis: .xinitrc only works with "startx"... so for DMed systems, not too helpful ;)
[23:41] <stueng> not sure, that doesnt really affect what im doing as freenx runs the command
[23:41] <dr_willis> stueng:  with remote desktops - i find the lightest is bestest.. :) somthing like openbox  with perhaps a simple file manager.
[23:41] <dr_willis> Ive seen lightdm have options to run the users .xinitrc session
[23:41] <stueng> it needs to be somewhat pretty
[23:41] <stueng> its for users
[23:41] <ubuntu-tester> Feedhurley: yes, which of the two you can't use?
[23:41] <Feedhurley> ubuntu-tester i have problem with both. The ntfs partition cant be opened and the ext4 cant create or paste any files or folders into
[23:42] <dr_willis> actually i thoght freenx was supposed to run lightdm.. i never was able to get freenx working right
[23:42] <stueng> it runs gnome-fallback fine
[23:42] <ubuntu-tester> Feedhurley: are they mentioned in fstab?
[23:42] <Feedhurley> "sudo blkid" gives me the UUID, if that was what you ment?

[23:47] <ubottu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome), K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE), or Menu -> Accessories -> LXTerminal (LXDE). Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal

[23:54] <ubuntu-tester> jcao219: if hdd is really falling, every extra read/write opreations can sometimes add damage. it is recommended to take image of the whole disk with ddrescue (it does it clever way, while dd dumb way) and make any recovery on the image. in this case parallel ops are safe. this way requires a lot of space though.
