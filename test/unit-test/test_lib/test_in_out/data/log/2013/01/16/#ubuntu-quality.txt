[06:07] <pitti> Good morning
[07:19] <dholbach> good morning
[07:34] <pitti> jibel: hm, when I try to manually restart a jhbuild jenkins job, it is immediately "done" with a copy of the last log
[07:34] <pitti> jibel: it doesn't actually try to build it (I fixed the problem on rabisu, it does work now for gnome-terminal)
[08:09] <jibel> pitti, good morning
[08:09] <pitti> jibel: bonjour Monsieur, ça va?
[08:10] <jibel> pitti, very well, thank you, und selbst?
[08:10] <pitti> jibel: sehr gut, danke!
[08:10] <jibel> pitti, right, it's a bit special, jenkins doesn't drive the tests, but just display the results
[08:11] <pitti> jibel: is there a way to run a test manually that jenkins will pick up? I just did jhbuild buildone --check gnome-terminal
[08:11] <jibel> pitti, to restart a test you must change the checksum on the test host in ~/jhbuild-data/jhbuild.modules
[08:11] <jibel> just remove a character for example
[08:11] <pitti> aah, then the next cron run will pick it up?
[08:11] <jibel> pitti, yes
[08:12] <pitti> ah, seems it re-ran it now anyway
[08:12] <jibel> the problem I had is that you cannot have several jhbuild running in parallel
[08:12] <pitti> but good to know for the future
[08:13] <pitti> jibel: for modules that depend on each other? I often run stuff in parallel just fine
[08:14] <jibel> there was something with a locking of the package database
[08:17] <pitti> ah, I use "buildone" in parallel, not "build"; that might be it
[08:23] <jibel> pitti, I used build for the automated runs because it supports the option -C to force a checkout and autogen on failure
[08:24] <jibel> I think I could add it to buildone too
[08:24] <pitti> *nod*
[08:24] <pitti> ok, I think I defeated the glib tests now
[08:24] <pitti> I just install xterm; we really want to test the Terminal=true code paths, but xterm is sufficient
[08:25] <pitti> trying the "force rebuild" trick now with glib
[08:37] <pitti> jibel: I guess we need an RT to remove the broken "jhbuild-amd64-gnome-doc-utils" job from public jenkins, right? I'll file one
[08:38] <jibel> pitti, right, we do
[08:38] <pitti> jibel: ok, sent
[08:40] <jibel> pitti, I restarted gnome-control-center, it failed because .gitmodules was corrupted (unresolved conflict)
[08:41] <pitti> jibel: right, someone pointed out that our setup might have some problem with nested git modules
[08:41] <pitti> but they work for gstreamer, so probalby just a corrupted checkout indeed
[08:41] <pitti> thanks
[08:42] <jibel> pitti, it does, I rewrite urls in gitmodules on the fly to use git over http instead of native git and it sometimes break
[08:44] <pitti> jibel: ah, because of our proxy?
[08:44] <psivaa> bdmurray: thanks
[08:45] <jibel> pitti, yes, I hope I won't have to continue this gym in a close future

[11:33] <pitti> jibel: looking at gtk+ now
[11:52] <zyga> I've updated the integration tests branch
[11:52] <zyga> it now has far less commits than before
[11:52] <zyga> I removed some of the early mistakes
[11:52] <zyga> and code that I dind't know existed in the standard library
[11:52] <zyga> https://github.com/zyga/checkbox/compare/master...integration-tests
[11:52] <zyga> this is how integration test patch looks like now
[11:53] <zyga> it's still pretty big because TestCaseWithParameters patch has not landed to master so it's still here
[11:53] <zyga> spineau, brendand, ara: ^^
[11:53] <zyga> I would like to propose it to master now, unless there are any objections
[11:54] <jibel> pitti, several autopkgtest failed with a unicode error on amd64
[11:54] <jibel> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Raring/view/AutoPkgTest/job/raring-adt-gobject-introspection/ARCH=amd64,label=adt/25/console for example
[11:55] <jibel> it seems to be an error message that adt-run is trying to decode
[11:55] <pitti> indeed, so the test fails, and then that autopkgtest bug runs into a bug in the failure reporting; great
[11:55]  * zyga cannot wait to get this plainbox release into autopkgtests
[11:57] <jibel> pitti, unicode quotes
[11:57] <pitti> jibel: so this should probably .encode('UTF-8') the two arguments?
[11:57] <jibel> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Raring/view/AutoPkgTest/job/raring-adt-gobject-introspection/ARCH=amd64,label=adt/25/artifact/results/dsc0t-build-stderr
[11:57] <pitti> (not sure what 'result' is, whether it's just "PASS" or so and thus doesn't need encoding)
[11:58] <pitti> jibel: ooh -- that would be with the new glib?
[11:58] <pitti> jibel: that's indeed a valid point, we want to update those I think
[11:58] <jibel> pitti, right and adt-run failure is just a side effect
[11:58] <jibel> pitti, you know how much I like adt-run code, I'll look into this
[11:59] <jibel> (adt side that is)
[11:59] <pitti> oh, that affects a whole bunch of stuff
[11:59] <pitti> jibel: I'll get to it

[15:12] <pitti> argh, poppler too, fixing
[16:02] <pitti> yay, the gobject-introspection autopkgtest discovered another upstream regression
[16:10] <sk8r> does anyone know if there is a tester for the ubuntu phone os for a htc one s? cause i would be ok with being that guinea pig.
[16:11] <balloons> sk8r, atm there are no images for the htc one s
[16:12] <balloons> the only confirmed image is for the galaxy nexus, and it's not YET out :-) a few weeks and it should appear
[16:12] <sk8r> but it should not take long to make it to other handsets, correct?
[16:12] <balloons> that said, glad your interested, and there might be options for helping test without having a galaxy nexus
[16:14] <sk8r> like i said i have a one s and would love to put it on there.

[19:28] <dkessel> maybe it doesn't even get that far in a clean live environment?

[20:37] <dkessel> hey letozaf_
[20:38] <letozaf_> howzit ?
[20:40] <dkessel> well, fine :) i have been filing bugs and confirming some the last evenings... :)
[20:40] <dkessel> are you still working on autopilot tests?
[20:40] <robotfuel> not at the moment, but I can answer questions if you have any
[20:40] <thomi> dkessel: well, I'm working ona utopilot itself, rather than tests at the moment, why, what's up?
[20:40] <letozaf_> well I had a kind of a break :)
[20:40] <thomi> oh wait
[20:40] <thomi> sorry, I got confused
[20:41] <dkessel> thomi :)
[20:41] <thomi> thought that was for me. Going to get more coffee,
[20:41] <letozaf_> dkessel, I ran some tests on ARM
[20:41] <letozaf_> dkessel, but I will get back to it soon
[20:41] <robotfuel> I was in the wrong window sorry.
[20:41] <letozaf_> thomi, hi
[20:42] <dkessel> letozaf_, what ARM device do you have?
[20:42] <letozaf_> dkessel, a Panda Board
[20:42] <dkessel> thomi, i promise to get back to writing autopilot tests too :)
[20:43] <letozaf_> dkessel, have you done something interesting on autopilot ?
[20:44] <dkessel> letozaf_, nah. i started with the file-roller test and got stuck somewhere when trying to select an entry in a combobox and then paused...
[20:45] <dkessel> and currently cprofitt, me and maybe some other guys are trying to get 'ubuntu friendly' to run on our machines
[20:45] <letozaf_> dkessel, well when go get going, then you cannot stop :-D
[20:45] <letozaf_> I mean with autopilot
[20:47] <dkessel> yes, bad me...
[20:49] <letozaf_> dkessel, no! I also get stuck, like now, but I'm confident things will get fixed

[21:44] <thomi> .... almost done
[21:45] <balloons> yay!
[21:45] <thomi> balloons: ok, one last issue - we need a top-level package name... right now they're being installed to 'terminal', 'nautilus' etc, which is likely to cause conflicts
[21:45] <thomi> what should we use?
[21:46] <balloons> yes.. I had attempted to call it ubuntu-autopilot-tests
[21:46] <thomi> balloons: can't use '-' in a python module
[21:46] <balloons> generically the same as the project, hah
[21:47] <thomi> you can have '_' though :)
[21:47] <balloons> yes.. and I don't like '_'

[21:56] <zyga> balloons: classy
[21:57] <zyga> is there anyone that wants to have a look at some python test code?
[21:57] <thomi> balloons: you may want to tweak the values in setup.py
[21:57] <thomi> for example, the license
[21:57] <thomi> I just copied & adapted the unity autopilot test one :)
[21:57] <balloons> yes of course :-)
[21:58] <balloons> after I look, I reserve the right to ask questions
[21:59] <thomi> balloons: sure :)
[21:59] <thomi> I reserve the right to say "I don't know"
[21:59] <thomi> I'm really not a packaging expert, I've just packaged a few python modules before
[22:00] <letozaf_> zyga, what python test code ? I mean what for?
[22:01] <zyga> letozaf_: literally for unit testing
[22:01] <zyga> https://code.launchpad.net/~zkrynicki/checkbox/test-parameters/+merge/143376
[22:02] <balloons> hmm ok, so you added python2 switch, makes sense
[22:02] <thomi> balloons: possibly you don't need that... since there's only a setup.py file
[22:02] <balloons> still I like the explicitness
[22:02] <thomi> if you have (for example) a 'Makefile' in the root dir then you need to tell dh which buildsystem to use
[22:03] <letozaf_> zyga, would like to help but maybe someone more expert than me should do this, I just started with python :(
[22:03] <thomi> exactly, explicit is good
[22:05] <balloons> ohh shoot

[22:05] <balloons> I had myself as maintainer, but I didn't want it to be owned by me
[22:05] <thomi> hehe
[22:06] <balloons> so I guess I have to be maintainer?
[22:06] <thomi> I'm not really sure about that part - fginther would know more

[23:06] <Noskcaj> hello phillw
[23:08] <Noskcaj> so i missed the first classroom session?
[23:11] <Noskcaj> balloons, for the autopilot tests, how can we make autopilot aware of what programs you have installed and what DE you are using?
[23:11] <balloons> Noskcaj, yes.. we had 2 yesterday
[23:11] <balloons> lol
[23:11] <balloons> I don't know what day that was for you
[23:11] <balloons> 2 days ago?
[23:12] <Noskcaj> yeah
[23:12] <balloons> Noskcaj, umm.. it's possible, but presumably someone is running the test
[23:12] <balloons> it will just fail if you don't have the stuff installed
[23:12] <balloons> we have no fancy runners in place yet for this
[23:14] <Noskcaj> ok, i am making the manual version of the transmission testcase at the moment
[23:15] <Noskcaj> balloons, where are the logs for the classroom session?
[23:16] <balloons> sorry distracted

[23:23] <phillw> as there are now simple work-arounds to the KVM bugs, I have scheduled https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Activities/Classroom#Section_3 up for KVM and VBox.
[23:23] <phillw> I'll let the classroom people know.
[23:31] <phillw> Noskcaj: do people need to have testdrive already installed for your session?
