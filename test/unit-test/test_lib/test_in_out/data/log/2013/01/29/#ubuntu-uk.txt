[10:17] <BigRedS> If I see this, against what should I be filing a bug? http://avi.co/stuff/empathy_enter_account_settings.png
[10:17] <BigRedS> It doesn't look like it's part of empathy. Which reminds me, is there some other way to give empathy my Jabber details? I'm running low on working XMPP clients :)
[10:18] <popey> gnome-online-accounts
[10:18] <popey> IMO
[10:19] <BigRedS> Ah, now that I've uploaded a screenshot it's working...
[10:19] <directhex> ubuntu online accounts
[10:19] <BigRedS> well, it's getting one step further, now it's just refusing to maintain a connection....
[10:19] <directhex> which is heavily forked
[10:19] <directhex> from gnome online accounts
[10:20] <BigRedS> Why do I need to "Authorise Ubuntu to access [my] Jabber account"? I just want Empathy to be able to use it. Or is that what it means?
[10:20] <BigRedS> Ah, even if I try that it disconnects and helpfully tells me "No reason specified"
[10:21] <lornajane> at least it is honest
[10:21] <BigRedS> There's a huge number of problems that I'm having in 13.04 that were solved in about 2004. I'm really unconvinced by some of this 'progress'
[10:21] <directhex> computers are basically terrible
[10:23] <BigRedS> they used to be a good deal better. I'm a bit miffed at being in 'that' camp, but I'm really trying to work out what's better now...
[10:24] <directhex> http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html
[10:24] <brobostigon> good morning everyone,
[10:24] <BigRedS> Oh yeah, I still thing Gnome 3 was one big excuse to not fix NetworkManager
[10:28] <BigRedS> encrypted filesystems! That's one plus side. And the search-orientated DE is good, but it's a bit bad that Unity's broken alt-f2 a bit
[10:28] <directhex> computers are terrible
[10:31] <BigRedS> yeah, but they're made by people. They can't help but do what they're told, the poor things
[11:23] <bigcalm> Ahoy hoy
[11:27] <davmor2> Morning all
[11:50] <daubers> popey: You reading the reading hackspace mailing list by any chance?
[11:51] <popey> daubers: yeah
[11:51] <popey> fun
[11:51] <daubers> popey: Tell me about it. I seriously should just throw a django forum together that also works as a mailinglist
[11:52] <daubers> Don't really want to get involved in that argument though
[11:57] <daubers> popey: Also, interesting fact. Reading Hackspace 2.0 may have a coworking area
[11:57] <popey> interesting
[11:58] <daubers> Though there are some logistical and financial issues to overcome with relation to it
[11:58] <daubers> I can't remember if it was you or AlanBell that was interested in coworking spaces

[12:42] <chib_> ok thanks
[12:45] <popey> uhm
[12:47] <czajkowski> hows everyone ?
[12:47] <BigRedS> Amazing!
[12:47] <BigRedS> Actually, mildly annoyed at computers in general, but I've had a lot of coffee
[12:47] <lornajane> computers are rubbish, they'll never catch on
[12:48] <popey> +1
[12:48] <popey> lets all go and live in a commune in the forest
[12:48] <lornajane> ooh, yes
[12:48] <BigRedS> I mean, if all these problems were fixed I wouldn't really have a job, but if *some* of them were fixed I'd have an easier one :)
[12:49] <czajkowski> I've made two saucepans of soup today and chicken n veg stir fry for 6 dinners
[12:49] <czajkowski> turns out not sleeping leads to cooking
[12:49] <popey> i rediscovered old school rap music today
[12:49] <czajkowski> and only mildly frustrated at housemate for breaking washing machine and going ohh don't you just press the button harder
[12:49] <czajkowski> *wallop* no you don't
[12:49] <popey> been rocking out to Big Daddy Kane.
[12:50] <czajkowski> popey: link?
[12:50] <popey> spotify
[12:50] <lornajane> czajkowski: that sounds super tasty, although the not-sleeping is always bad news
[12:50] <czajkowski> popey: ah I dont use that
[12:50] <czajkowski> to youtube
[12:50] <Laney> you need a chopstick to press in the hole that once was the button
[12:50] <popey> its totally not PC
[12:50] <mungbean> anyone use OBDII readers on their car to get diagnostic and other fun stuff?
[12:51] <popey> wifey uses chopsticks to scratch her arm now it's in a plaster
[12:51] <popey> mungbean: i heard someone talking about it recently.. might be marxjohnson or lauracowen
[12:51] <Laney> I hope ones that won't break :(
[12:51] <popey> none have yet
[12:51] <Laney> also she should be careful not to break / irritate the skin
[12:51] <Laney> kind of bad if that happens underneath a cast
[12:51] <mungbean> i borrowed one off a mate but didn't do the full job
[12:51] <mungbean> not sure if my car or not
[12:51] <Laney> I used a 30cm ruler when I had my leg in plaster
[12:52] <mungbean> seems to be a minefield, like finding out how to install CM on your phone
[12:52] <mungbean> was a bit underwhelmed after installing android 4.1.2 on my tablet ..same as before mostly
[12:52] <czajkowski> lornajane: https://twitter.com/czajkowski/status/296239169741668352/photo/1
[12:52] <mungbean> was on CM9 previously
[12:53] <popey> pffft, CM is so yesterday.. all the cool kids are putting Ubuntu Phone on their Android devices ;)
[12:53] <lornajane> czajkowski: cooking is therapy, and that really does all look great :)
[12:54] <czajkowski> yup just waiting on a mate to pop over so we'll either have vegetable soup the larger one, or some butternut squash which I've gone mad on lately
[12:54] <Laney> jerusalem artichoke soup
[12:54] <Laney> it's the best. make it make it MAKE IT
[12:55] <Laney> corned beef hash time!
[12:55] <czajkowski> lornajane: how about we make it and box you up in it :)
[12:55] <czajkowski> not a lover of corned beef
[12:55] <popey> ooo, not had corned beef for ages
[12:59] <mungbean> would love ubuntu on my tablet
[12:59] <mungbean> more ideal than the phone tbh
[13:00] <popey> which tablet?
[13:00] <popey> the HP one?
[13:01] <mungbean> yesh
[13:01] <mungbean> with ubuntu on it i could get a keyboard and have more powerful device than a big phone
[13:02] <lornajane> I think you're describing a netbook
[13:02] <popey> heh
[13:03] <mungbean> what i really like is the asus transformer
[13:04] <popey> overrated
[13:04] <mgdm> +1
[13:04] <mungbean> running ubuntu 13.01 touchy terrapin would be great use case and would be my future laptop replacement
[13:05] <davmor2> mungbean: get a nexus 7 plus the nice metal clip on keyboard if you want something like that
[13:05] <lornajane> I have the thinkpad X220T with touch screen and swivel, it's nice
[13:06] <mungbean> popey: u have a trnasformer right?
[13:07] <popey> mungbean: i did, but not anymore
[13:08] <davmor2> mungbean: http://bit.ly/VPXNob this one
[13:09] <mungbean> davmor2: i've seen similar cases for ipad but none for my touchpad
[13:09] <mungbean> need to test the TP with my friends ipad one
[13:10] <mungbean> but yes, i like this
[13:11] <popey> current tablet du jour here is the nexus 7
[13:12] <popey> I also have a SmartQ T20 and iPad 1.
[13:16]  * popey hugs Myrtti 
[13:21] <Myrtti> whee, after a year watching locale error messages, I now finally decided to get rid of it
[13:26] <dwatkins> cool
[13:27] <dwatkins> I get an RPC error at shutdown, but havn't looked into whether I can get rid of it yet, as I don't look at the screen during shutdown very often.
[13:28] <popey> yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
[13:28] <popey> You know when you lose those dongles that come with wireless mice?
[13:28] <popey> I just dug an HP xe4100 laptop out of a drawer and there's one I've been looking for, in the USB port
[13:28] <dwatkins> there are wireless mice with dongles?
[13:28] <popey> \o/
[13:28] <popey> there are
[13:28] <dwatkins> heh, nice one
[13:28] <popey> most have them
[13:28] <dwatkins> why don't they just use Bluetooth, though?
[13:29] <mgdm> ecause it's less faff not to, I'd guess
[13:29] <popey> because bluetooth eats batteries
[13:29] <popey> and you have no guarantee the device has bluetooth, so why not ship a dongle
[13:29] <lornajane> this is exactly why I like my peripherals wired, they're harder to lose
[13:29] <popey> (these aren't bluetooth)
[13:29] <popey> i dont think this laptop has been booted in ~2 years
[13:29] <mungbean> i have a wireless mouse thats not bt
[13:29] <mungbean> some other hfreq
[13:30] <mgdm> My presenter mouse has a tiny dongle that fits inside it. Other than that most things I have are wired, apart from my Apple trackpad, which is Bluetooth
[13:31] <popey> heh, this windows xp partition has Firefox 3.5.15 on it
[13:31] <dwatkins> blast from the past
[13:31] <popey> "v.3.5.15, released October 27th, 2010
[13:31] <popey> "
[13:31] <dwatkins> I wish I'd never given away my tiny mouse, it was rather handy for presnetations
[13:31] <popey> guess what the first popup was when I connected it to the net was?
[13:32] <davmor2> popey: Antivirus update?
[13:32] <dwatkins> you are using page with some insecure content?
[13:33] <mungbean> install chrome?
[13:33] <popey> nope
[13:33] <lornajane> it looks like you're writing a letter?
[13:33] <popey> hah
[13:33] <mungbean> install ie8
[13:34] <dwatkins> your browser is out of date?
[13:34] <popey> well, thats try dwatkins and it did tell me when i opened ff, but what's the first thing that nagged me on windows login?
[13:34] <mungbean> your OS is not legal?
[13:34] <popey> haha, no
[13:35] <popey> and I am offended you think it might be! ☺
[13:35] <dwatkins> "You appear to be using an ancient and unsupported proprietary operating system, would you like to purchase Windows 8 or just download Ubuntu for free?"
[13:35] <mungbean> windows changes its mind sometimes
[13:35] <davmor2> popey: You're on XP still stupid install windows 8 now?
[13:35] <dwatkins> yeah, hardware changes can force a relicense
[13:35] <popey> true dat
[13:36] <popey> i used to use this daily on my commute, cracking little laptop
[13:39] <directhex> protip: windows 8 upgrade prices will more than double in 2 days' time
[13:40] <directhex> if you think you'll ever want it, buy today, not next week
[13:40] <popey> \o/
[13:43] <directhex> until the end of jan, win8 pro upgrades are £24.99 if downloaded. not 100% sure what the UK price will be on friday, but if the US pricing is an indication, then £125
[13:44] <directhex> this is, of course, how microsoft have been able to claim to investors that they sold a record number of win8 licenses in 2012q4
[13:46] <mungbean> have an interview in a few minutes, since my job is going away to be replaced by a very simlar looking one :S
[13:46] <dwatkins> also, if you buy Windows 8, get the Windows Media Centre upgrade before 31st Jan for free
[14:03] <davmor2> popey: did we get to the bottom of what the first popup was?
[14:03] <popey> you did not
[14:04] <davmor2> popey: there are updates this system will restart in 10......9.....
[14:04] <popey> nope ☺
[14:04] <davmor2> popey: I still think it was av updates :D
[14:06] <popey> nope
[14:10] <davmor2> popey: No wait it was the anti virus annoucing you had a virus
[14:16] <davmor2> popey: new hardware because it found the mouse
[14:18] <popey> nope
[14:18] <davmor2> popey: BSOD
[14:18] <dwatkins> your resolution is set to a default abysmal value?
[14:18] <popey> I should put you out of your misery ☺
[14:19] <dwatkins> this is fun ;)
[14:19] <popey> ok
[14:19] <dwatkins> Come play "How Many Errors Can A Windows Machine Have?" on #ubuntu-uk....
[14:19] <davmor2> popey: minecraft has an update
[14:19] <popey> hah, no way this can run minecraft
[14:19] <dwatkins> did it install the driver for the hard disk?
[14:20] <popey> no new hardware
[14:20] <dwatkins> or simply tell you it had to reboot...
[14:20] <dwatkins> "just finished installing something, now reboot, even though you just did that"
[14:20] <davmor2> popey: windows was not shut down properly did you want to report the issue?
[14:22] <popey> it wasn't anything to do with windows itself
[14:23] <davmor2> popey: 2010 you say was it a calendar popup for the lucid release party?
[14:23] <dwatkins> Steam is offline
[14:23] <popey> haha
[14:24] <davmor2> yeah steam recommends the use of Ubuntu would be the other one :D
[14:24] <dwatkins> "mplayer couldn't download an update, the website has been compromised" (I get this on my home PC)
[14:24] <dwatkins> davmor2: that would be amusing
[14:25] <davmor2> popey: You have 3,000,000 unread messages in your inbox?
[14:26] <dwatkins> an advert for viagra?
[14:26] <popey> bet if I post it on twitter someone will get it instantly ☺
[14:27] <dwatkins> yeah, twitter has more users :-p
[14:27] <popey> hah
[14:28] <dwatkins> so it wasn't a message from Windows
[14:28] <dwatkins> was it a message from an application?
[14:29] <davmor2> popey: windows messenger couldn't connect or it has updated to skype
[14:33] <davmor2> popey: there are possibly more windows users on twitter too :D
[14:36] <dwatkins> popey: would you like to join Google+?
[14:39] <dwatkins> are we even close, popey?
[14:43] <popey> dwatkins: join G+?
[14:43] <popey> I'm on it
[14:44] <davmor2> popey: Was it you're using that ubuntu again aren't you and then xp strops off in a huff?
[14:44] <popey> you're all wrong ☺
[14:46] <davmor2> popey: apparently you are late for the recording of UUPC season 3 episode 6?
[14:51] <dwatkins> popey: true, but you might have a secondary gmail account which you hadn't already G+ified
[14:51] <dwatkins> so, how wrong are we, popey? is it an application?
[14:53] <mungbean> usually first nag messages are adobe, java, windows update,
[14:53] <mungbean> and antivirus
[14:53] <mungbean> all within 2 mins of boot :(
[14:53] <mungbean> which is why my wife moved to ubuntu
[14:54] <davmor2> it'll be the java 7 update with the complete breakage then I bet
[15:02] <awilkins> Can't get a straight answer for this through trivial searching - monthly cost for a web host with 500Mbit/s bandwidth?
[15:10] <dwatkins> awilkins: a friend of mine linked me to this recently: http://www.lowendbox.com/
[15:10] <popey> finally davmor2 gets it
[15:11] <dwatkins> tada
[15:11] <davmor2> popey: mungbean pointed me in the right direction
[15:11] <dwatkins> awilkins: this list might also be useful: http://www.top10webhosting.com/
[15:12] <awilkins> Heh, people throwing around requirements like "200 people should be able to download 500MB in less than 30 minutes simultaneously"

[19:25] <AlanBell> evening all
[19:26] <brobostigon> evening AlanBell
[19:27] <AlanBell> anyone tried broadway recently, which is putting gtk applications into a browser?
[19:32] <brobostigon> no, first time i have heard if it.
[20:45]  * AlanBell is upgrading to Raring
[20:59] <Azelphur> Hmm, anyone here familiar with sixaxis? I'm having issues
[20:59] <Azelphur> I plug my controller in, run sudo sixpair, it detects my controller, then I run sixad --start, it says press the PS button now, which I do
[20:59] <Azelphur> and then..nothing happens
[21:03] <daftykins> Azelphur: any landlord news sir?
[21:04] <Azelphur> daftykins: a little, he finally sent out a plumber for the boiler and got that sorted, still leaving pretty much everything else however
[21:05] <daftykins> =/
[21:05] <daftykins> not even any comments on it?
[21:05] <Azelphur> I pointed out the door on the washing machine was broken, so he said he'll just take the washing machine away today and I'll buy a new one, which was "nice" of him
[21:05] <Azelphur> but then he didn't even turn up to take it away, >.<
[21:05] <daftykins> what a todger
[21:05] <Azelphur> nope
[21:06] <Azelphur> still got all the same issues pretty much, still ignoring everything
[21:06] <daftykins> =[
[21:06] <Azelphur> but at least he came out for the boiler so we are one step in the right direction, if I can just get him to sort out a letterbox I'll be happier
[21:06] <daftykins> he shall be the first to die in our new world
[21:06] <Azelphur> not having a letterbox is frustrating as hell
[21:07] <Azelphur> you order something online, but you don't know when it's coming because most things are 3-5 days, you miss the delivery and they can't put the note through the door so you can't go and collect it.
[21:08] <Klettbar> why haven't you got one
[21:08] <Klettbar> how come
[21:10] <Klettbar> the simpler things
[21:10] <Klettbar> like a laptop without  a battery
[21:10] <Azelphur> Klettbar: landlord keeps saying he'll do it and then doesn't
[21:10] <Azelphur> :<
[21:10] <Klettbar> they should sell bateeries and build laptops around them
[21:11] <Klettbar> maybe you can do it yourself and get a refund
[21:11] <Klettbar> proposing that you can
[21:11] <Azelphur> yea, we was going to go for legal advice on monday, but he turned up with a plumber on monday and actually made some progress
[21:11] <Azelphur> the plumber was really nice, the landlord had only scheduled him to fix the boiler
[21:12] <Azelphur> but I explained how I had a leaking radiator and tap that the landlord was being so troublesome about, so the plumber did those too (yay)
[21:13] <daftykins> Azelphur: neat :D
[21:14] <Azelphur> my boiler had him stumped for ages, he took the entire thing apart and had to read the manual before we figured out what was going on
[21:14] <Azelphur> apparently after 19 hours it disables itself and doesn't turn on again unless you do a reset procedure
[21:14] <Azelphur> and because the radiator leaked, it depressurised and turned the thing off, by the time I figured out that it was off, 19 hours had already passed I guess
[21:15]  * AlanBell is on raring
[21:15] <Klettbar> plumbing is serious stuff
[21:15] <Azelphur> indeed \o/
[21:16] <Azelphur> but yea, stuff is going wrong faster than it's getting fixed
[21:16] <daftykins> welcome to houses
[21:16] <daftykins> :/
[21:16] <Azelphur> there's a pipe on the side of the building that has burst due to the cold weather now, it spews out water
[21:16] <Azelphur> funny enough right on top of the previous problem where the gutters are broken
[21:17] <Azelphur> so it's like, double waterfall
[21:17] <daftykins> :O
[21:17] <daftykins> what kind of pipe?
[21:17] <Azelphur> I'm not sure exactly, its not constantly flowing, maybe a drain from a sink or something.
[21:18] <daftykins> you got any pics? that place sounds... rundown
[21:18] <Azelphur> I got a fun pic of the most recent issue
[21:18] <Azelphur> the oven went supernova
[21:19] <Klettbar> have you found out where the main valve is
[21:19] <Klettbar> to stop all input water in in case of
[21:19] <Klettbar> i knwo what i mean
[21:19] <Azelphur> I put some burgers in there, used an eggtimer so I knew what was going on, first 10 minutes were fine, over the next 5 minutes it literally turned into a smoke machine and filled the entire room

[21:20] <daftykins> Klettbar: stopcock yeah :)
[21:20] <Azelphur> Klettbar: nope, perhaps I should do :P
[21:20] <daftykins> whoa
[21:20] <Klettbar> first thing
[21:20] <Klettbar> teh save ass stopcock
[21:20] <daftykins> that looks like some tiny ducting above the extractor fan, if that is one
[21:21] <daftykins> how long did that take to clear? D:
[21:21] <Azelphur> daftykins: when I moved in the previous tenants had left a frying pan full of fat/oil in the oven, we cleaned it out properly, but I figure they somehow got oil inside the oven, so when the oven reaches full temp, boom.
[21:21] <Azelphur> a few hours.
[21:21] <daftykins> a trap :(
[21:21] <Azelphur> indeed
[21:22] <daftykins> perhaps to punish the sucky landlord
[21:22] <Azelphur> literally it did all that in a matter of minutes, I was coming down and checking on it every 5 minutes
[21:22] <Klettbar> what the best second hand laptop buy deal on ebay
[21:22] <Klettbar> is
[21:22] <Klettbar> changing topic
[21:22] <Azelphur> Klettbar: look for dell refurbs, there's lots on there that are pretty cheap and have warranty.
[21:22] <daftykins> i've heard bad things about electronics on ebay
[21:22] <Azelphur> also, you might want to check the dell outlet, same thing.
[21:23] <Azelphur> I buy a lot of electronics from ebay
[21:23] <Klettbar> they say dell is not that reliable
[21:23] <Azelphur> Klettbar: you can quite safely find anyone to say anything is unreliable.
[21:23] <Azelphur> especially with laptop, everyone has a brand they hate
[21:23] <Klettbar> ranking
[21:23] <daftykins> ^ +1
[21:23] <Klettbar> panasonic
[21:23] <daftykins> if you look for bad press you shall find
[21:23] <Klettbar> toshiba?
[21:23] <Klettbar> ibm?
[21:23] <Klettbar> i like hp
[21:24] <Klettbar> buying laptop is liek getting a girlfriend
[21:24] <Klettbar> you shoudl li?
[21:24] <Klettbar> no no
[21:24] <Klettbar> panasonic are sturdy but look a bit too cold
[21:47] <daftykins> http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21252362
[21:47] <daftykins> that's pretty ^_^
[21:58] <shauno> same old same old from this pov  (west coast ireland, pretty dependable blanket cloud coverage)
[21:59] <daftykins> ah yeah you were in the Galway area weren't you?
[21:59] <shauno> yeah
[22:00] <shauno> there was a similar one last winter I think.  and again the same great 'shield wall' of cloud
[22:00] <daftykins> i'm in Guernsey so no snow here :<
[22:01] <shauno> I'm just jealous.  I miss having seasons
[22:01] <daftykins> hehe
[22:01] <daftykins> is it that bad constantly over there?
[22:02] <shauno> it's pretty consistent.  we tend to get a clearer spell around easter, and usually another in the summer
[22:02] <daftykins> ouch
[22:02] <shauno> but I believe our driest month of the year is still 15 days precipitation
[22:02] <daftykins> wow, how does anyone stay anything but miserable there?
[22:03] <shauno> alcohol :D
[22:03] <daftykins> XD
[22:04] <shauno> you just get used to it I guess.  like when I was in michigan, 4 months of snow was normal.  4 days cripples the UK, but when it's normal, you just ignore it and carry on
[22:05] <Azelphur> Anyone know how to get dualshock3's working in Ubuntu via bluetooth?
[22:05] <daftykins> yeah i bet it's a laugh seeing the UK 'coping' :)
[22:05] <daftykins> Azelphur: i see you tried xbmc which would've been my idea, i think some of those lot use the PS3 controllers as remotes, maybe the xbmc forum has something?
[22:06] <daftykins> otherwise i was sure directhex or popey had played with one at some point on Linux perhaps 0o
[22:06] <Azelphur> daftykins: yea, I've tried lots of documentation and following guides and am just not getting anywhere :<
[22:06] <popey> not I
[22:06] <popey> I have GC and PS2 controllers on my PC
[22:06] <daftykins> ooh-err, i tells a lie - apologies
[22:06] <popey> ☺
[22:06] <Azelphur> hehe
[22:07] <Azelphur> frustrating because sixpair sees it, but sixad won't see me pressing the PS button.
[22:07] <daftykins> how wude
[22:07] <Azelphur> indeed
[22:09] <daftykins> computers eh, sometimes i wonder why we bother ^_^
[22:09] <directhex> i had a python-based driver for the ps3 remote (not pad)
[22:15] <daftykins> ah-har
[22:20]  * solarcloud_3srcn ate too many chips tonite. Computing now seems pointless to him. Please encourage solarcloud_3scrn to get back on his little horse.....
[22:23] <popey> we should all go and live in the forest

[22:25] <daftykins> wow
[22:26] <popey> very interesting read
[22:26] <popey> and sad
[22:28] <solarcloud_3srcn> I wonder if Radio would have corrupted them, if they'd had one ??
[22:30] <solarcloud_3srcn> There is a guy in czech that lives like that ... http://dudmanovi.cz/#&panel1-3
[22:55] <directhex> tame the noble savage!
[22:55] <daftykins> omg landscape why are you causing such regular disk activity =|
[22:58] <dwatkins> 'The family's principal entertainment, the Russian journalist Vasily Peskov noted, "was for everyone to recount their dreams."' - dreams can be pretty spectacular, though
[22:58] <dwatkins> I wonder if that's the case if you've been isolated from the world for four decades, though.
[22:58] <directhex> "i dreamed we had 940 lbs of potatoes. it was good."
[22:59] <daftykins> ;)
[22:59] <dwatkins> haha, perhaps spectacular to them
[22:59] <daftykins> i'd imagine they're far more creative than mine
[22:59] <daftykins> i often dream of IM conversation =|
[22:59] <daftykins> i see the text move upward as if watching a screen
[22:59] <dwatkins> I don't even remember my dreams very often, but some people I know have vivid dreams with exciting adventures.
[22:59] <directhex> daftykins, you're dreaming right now!
[22:59] <dwatkins> daftykins: that's not a dream, you just fell asleep on the keyboard ;)
[23:00] <daftykins> ;)
[23:02] <dwatkins> "in 1961 it snowed in June" that's Russia for you, I guess
[23:02] <daftykins> :D
[23:03] <daftykins> ooh-err
[23:04] <daftykins> i can see how the geologists want to offer them things
[23:04] <daftykins> but do they not see they're also kind of... ruining them step by step =/
[23:06] <dwatkins> I wondered that, but they're not aboriginal people untouched by technology, they were just sort of forgotten
[23:06] <dwatkins> well, they ran away, but they separated themselves from the world, as opposed to never having been part of it
[23:06] <daftykins> depends if they choose to remain that way i guess
[23:07] <dwatkins> yeah, I imagine it should be up to them (as a group or individually) to decide if they stay living out there or go somewhere else, knowing what they then did.
[23:07]  * dwatkins hasn't got to the part about their subsequent fate yet
[23:07]  * daftykins aims not to spoil :>
[23:07] <dwatkins> certainly goes to show that you can do a lot without metal
[23:08] <daftykins> indeed
[23:08] <daftykins> necessity being the mother of invention :>
[23:08] <dwatkins> I can't imagine how you would plane a log without a saw
[23:08] <dwatkins> I guess he used stone
[23:09] <popey> nn chaps
[23:09] <popey> enjoy sweet dreams of living in russian forests
[23:09] <dwatkins> later popey
[23:09] <daftykins> popey: o/
[23:09] <dwatkins> I dream of not being entranced by television
[23:09] <daftykins> thanks for the link
[23:09] <dwatkins> fascinating stuff, yeah
[23:09] <popey> np
[23:10] <popey> yeah
[23:10] <popey> lots of further comments on hn

[23:10] <popey> links to other info / videos / pictures
[23:14] <dwatkins> I'm reminded of a thread on reddit recently which asked what people from the 1950s would think of modern technology, my favorite comment was along the lines of "they would find it impossible to understand that we have the entirety of human knowlege at our fingertips, and yet we use our phones to watch videos of cats and people falling over"
[23:15] <directhex> cat pictures!
[23:16] <dwatkins> them too
[23:17] <dwatkins> http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15yaap/if_someone_from_the_1950s_suddenly_appeared_today/ - "I possess a device, in my pocket, that is capable of accessing the entirety of information known to man.
[23:17] <dwatkins> I use it to look at pictures of cats and get in arguments with strangers."
[23:28] <daftykins> =]
[23:30] <daftykins> can't stand reddit, but wow the Queen meeting all those US presidents
[23:30] <daftykins> epic.
[23:32] <dwatkins> I reckon she's immortal, and dyes her hair.
[23:38] <daftykins> XD
[23:38] <daftykins> benefits to not speaking much
[23:38] <daftykins> i bet she's an IRC'er
[23:43] <dwatkins> perhaps she's here right now
[23:44] <dwatkins> evening ma'am *bows*
