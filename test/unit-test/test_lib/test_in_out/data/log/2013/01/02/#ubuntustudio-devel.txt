[12:13] <ttoine> hello
[12:14] <zequence-w> hi ttoine 
[12:16] <ttoine> zequence-w, at work ?
[12:22] <zequence-w> ttoine: It's kind of work, yes
[12:22] <zequence-w> It's what w stands for anyway :)
[12:25] <ttoine> happy new year !!
[12:26] <zequence-w> I started mine with oversleeping :P
[12:38] <astraljava> Better set the standards low enough so there's room for improvement.
[13:40] <scott-work> good morning everyone. i wish that the new year brings happiness and prosperity to all :)
[13:49] <zequence-w> astraljava: Very true
[13:50] <zequence-w> scott-work: Happy New Year
[13:51] <zequence-w> scott-work: I was thinking about PR. No word from RT yet. I think ttoine might be eager to do some stuff, so perhaps give him admin access to various social sites?
[13:51] <zequence-w> We were talking about the fb page, and it would be nice to improve its appearance
[13:52] <zequence-w> But before we do that, maybe we should talk about a unified theme idea first
[13:52] <zequence-w> We have the logo
[13:52] <zequence-w> I mean, the round icon thing
[13:52] <zequence-w> And, we have the name Ubuntu Studio. I guess it would be nice to use the same logo for that on all sites
[13:53] <zequence-w> Additionally, we could use a slogan
[13:53] <zequence-w> I forget what it was on the plymoth theam
[13:53] <zequence-w> theme*
[14:11] <zequence-w> Different services have different possibilities, but I think we should be able to use the same material for all
[14:11] <zequence-w> Different possibilities for theming, that is..
[14:12] <zequence-w> 1. the US icon-logo 2. the US name-logo 3. a slogan (perhaps tied with the name-logo) 4. background canvas (for sites that allow it)
[14:13] <zequence-w> Any thoughts?
[14:22] <astraljava> IANAGD, but IMHO the slogan should really be really good, if we're intending to use one. +1 on the rest.
[14:29] <zequence-w> It's good to have a slogan that explains what Ubuntu Studio is, to those who never heard of it
[14:29] <zequence-w> There was one in the plymoth theme, but I forget how it went
[14:30] <zequence-w> It was "Linux for creative humans" or something along those lines
[14:30] <zequence-w> A bit Ubuntuish, but yet more universal, when referring to Linux
[14:58] <scott-work> zequence-w: i completely agree with using unified themeing elements
[14:59] <scott-work> i had come up with "linux for creative humans" in a artwork image i had done, i don't remember if it was actually made it into the plymouth theme
[15:03] <scott-work> zequence: as to ttoine, absolutely i can give him access to the various social sites
[15:03] <scott-work> i almost hesitate to mention this because it seems that i am arguing against giving him access (i am not), but he doesn't really need admin access to post ;)
[15:06] <scott-work> zequence: as to the logo stuff, i am actually very close to having https://launchpad.net/ubuntustudio-resources updated with various graphics that i have been finding and aggregating
[15:07] <scott-work> this may be a good place (when i get it updated by this week) to peruse for choosing one of the logos
[15:07] <ttoine> scott-work, I need access to setup twitterfeed, at least
[15:07] <scott-work> ttoine: i don't think we have a twitter account yet since we were waiting to push the current owner off of "ubuntu studio"
[15:08] <ttoine> scott-work, twitterfeed and twitter are not the same at all
[15:08] <scott-work> oh
[15:08]  * scott-work shows his lack of social media savvy :P
[15:08] <ttoine> twitterfeed is a bit.ly service to post rss feeds on social networks. I use it for some customers when jetpack is not possible
[15:09] <scott-work> heh, i don't know what jetpack is either ;)
[15:09] <scott-work> ttoine: what do you need from me in order to set up twitterfeed?
[15:10] <ttoine> just to be admin of the fb page
[15:10] <ttoine> scott-work, and if I am admin, I can help you with moderation, in case (I hope...) there will be a lot of people posting,...
[15:11] <scott-work> ttoine: admin of facebook page i can do :)  facebook is blocked by the sonicwall device at work, but i can use my tablet to get around it (hopefully) or do it at home tonight
[15:12] <scott-work> ttoine: how can i find you on facebook to add you as admin?
[15:13] <ttoine> https://www.facebook.com/ttoine
[15:13] <ttoine> first of all, add me as a friend
[15:13] <scott-work> heh, it looks like "linux for creative humans" made it into plymouth ;)  http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5308/5733545482_4d8f336566_z.jpg
[15:14] <ttoine> scott-work, yes, i noticed it. it is already in 12.10, too
[15:15] <ttoine> scott-work, I installed a fresh 12.10 and updated it. What is the best way to upgrade to 13.04 ? I change the source.list and make a dist-upgrade ?
[15:16] <scott-work> ttoine: i'm not sure of the _best_ way to update to a dev copy. i think what you described will work however
[15:18] <ttoine> scott-work, I try that and I let you know
[15:30] <scott-work> ttoine: i sent you a message in facebook. i am forced to use my tablet and therefore the mobile version of facebook to find you currently and i simply could not find a way to initiate a friend request on it.
[15:33] <scott-work> bah. i simply can't function on the mobile app. ttoine, i will add you to the facebook admin when i get home tonight.
[15:34] <ttoine> scott-work, i posted on the ubuntu studio wall a hop !
[15:35] <ttoine> antoine thomas, with a colored hand on black background
[15:36] <scott-work> i found your profile (i like the hand, by the way!) but i didn't see anywhere on the screen for a friend request
[15:36] <ttoine> ios ? android ?
[15:36] <scott-work> android
[15:36] <ttoine> scott-work, strange...
[15:37] <ttoine> it is not a hurry
[15:37] <ttoine> do it when possible
[16:10] <scott-work> hehe, found this by accident...it's just a mock up, not real: http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y65/NinjaKrow/Linux-Stuff/ShirtPropsal-Studio01.jpg
[18:04] <ttoine> scott-work, nice t-shirt
[18:04] <ttoine> would be great to have some like that on the ubuntu store !
[18:40] <scott-work> agreed! hopefully we can get some artwork done that is presentable for such a thing
[19:04] <ttoine> scott-work, you really think it is possible to make it available ?
[19:04] <scott-work> "open your creativity" might be an interesting tag line or something to play around with
[19:05] <scott-work> ttoine: i think so. i'm not exactly sure about what it takes to get in into the official ubuntu store, but xubuntu does their own thing and i was planning on doing similar
[19:06] <scott-work> i have already talked to a guy i work with because his wife does embroidery and once i get all the artwork together i plan to take a good .svg of the CoF and have a nice shirt made as a prototype
=== Lump|AFK is now known as Lumpy
[19:06] <scott-work> then i wanted to explore different designs to see about getting it done in an online shop of some sort
[19:07] <scott-work> i think xubuntu uses zazzle (if i remember correctly)
[19:09] <ttoine> scott-work, but maybe xubuntu has a legal status
[19:09] <ttoine> it is not only a community
[19:10] <ttoine> maybe we will have to create a sort of non profit organisation ?
[19:11] <ttoine> scott-work, maybe, it would be great to have a kind of map or the team, with timelines
[19:13] <ttoine> scott-work, I told you I let you know
[19:13] <ttoine> the upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04 is finished, all seems to be well
[19:13] <ttoine> except it is mostly in english
[19:14] <ttoine> but it is not really a problem
[19:14] <ttoine> if you want me to test something, let me know
[19:15] <scott-work> ttoine: i'm glad the update went well :)
[19:15] <scott-work> even if it is in english
[19:15] <scott-work> ttoine: from what i have heard, xubuntu has the latitude to make their own shirts as long as they don't really make money from it, which equates to selling at cost
[19:18] <ttoine> scott-work, I understand that. but who, or how is managed the money ?
[19:19] <ttoine> for Ubuntu-Lyon, my city loco team, there is a non profit organisation. I know this is the same for ubuntu-fr
[19:32] <scott-work> ttoine: i'm not sure they are managing the money. if xubuntu upload the graphics and sets the price at cost, then users buy direct from cafepress/zazzle/whomever. i'm not absolutely certain this is how it is working for xubuntu, but that is what i surmised
=== scott-work_ is now known as scott-work
[20:39] <ttoine> scott-work, ok. I didn't know that it was possible like that
[20:49] <ttoine> good to know !
[21:38] <len-1304> Interesting...  I was in the bios turning off the internal Audio and noticed that I could turn the irqs off on USB.
[21:38] <len-1304> So I tried it :)
[21:39] <len-1304> It appears that it just stops the bios from preselecting irqs.
[21:40] <len-1304> I was still able to boot from a USB drive, And the USB stuff still has IRQs.
[21:41] <len-1304> However, The IRQ selection... I am assuming done by the kernel, Makes much more sense.
[21:42] <len-1304> The one ehci irq is on it's own now (USB 2.0), and my eth0 is now on it's own and it has left the audio IFs alone too.
[21:43] <len-1304> zequence, holstein ^^^ FYI
[21:48] <scott-work> hmmm. interesting news. how old is your motherboard len-1304 ?
[21:50] <len-1304> MY MB is quite old (8 to 10 years) But it is still something to look for if someone is having problems finding open irqs
[21:52] <len-1304> It is an "A-Bit AC7"
[21:53] <scott-work> oh wow, i thought this would have been a newer motherboard to allow you to turn off auto irq
[21:54] <len-1304> It was one of the "top" MB in it's day... not so top when I got it used :)
[21:55] <scott-work> going home, will work on ttoine getting onto facebook and adding artwork to the -resources launchpad "code"
[22:12] <zequence> many boards have custom IRQ settings, but I've found that sometimes they don't do anything, since the kernel sets its own IRQs
[22:13] <len-1304> zequence, Made a difference here though. Not sure why. Just something to keep in mind as one more thing to try when having trouble.
[22:16] <len-1304> I wonder how open the irq settings are. I wonder if there is any way of "helping" the kernel decide these things.
[22:17] <len-1304>  My MB has only 24 IRQs, but a lot of the newer ones have 48 (like my netbook) or 100.
[22:18] <len-1304> The PCI bus only has wiring for so many, but if non-pci stuff could be made to leave it alone, that would be good.
[22:20] <holstein> len-1304: its nice to have IRQ settings in a bios
[22:20] <len-1304> PCIe has one I think, but each card can have a virtual IRQ or some such. The PCI cards IRQ is sent to the MB via the same stream as the data.
[22:21] <len-1304> holstein, I think many MBs do, but we don't always know what they do.
[22:22] <holstein> len-1304: and the UI's is always different
[22:22] <len-1304> Ya
[22:22] <len-1304> note/net-books sometimes don't have many options though
[22:53] <ScottL> ttoine, i can't add you as a friend in facebook. do you have it blocked?
[22:53] <ScottL> ttoine, i will also need an email address to add you as a facebook admin for ubuntu studio
[22:54] <ScottL> zequence, do you wish to be facebook admin as well?
[22:56] <ScottL> ttoine, look under "privacy shortcuts" and "who can contact me" and see what "who can send me friend request"
[23:43] <zequence> ScottL: Sure. Here's my "official" fb page https://www.facebook.com/xequential
