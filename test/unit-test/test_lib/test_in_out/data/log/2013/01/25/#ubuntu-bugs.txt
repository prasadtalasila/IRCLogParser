[18:38] <psusi> wasn't there a tag to make the bot stop messing with bugs in the linux package?

[18:42] <ogra_> or some such
[18:44] <psusi> that's it
[19:17] <bluefoxxx> this is probably a better channel than #-devel
[19:17] <bluefoxxx> is it appropriate to file bugs in the distribution found?
[19:17] <bluefoxxx> Or should I be working my way upstream, checking for behavior in Debian, and filing from top down?
[19:17] <bluefoxxx> Particularly in this case apache2 comes with a configuration file that includes a global Listen directive
[19:18] <bluefoxxx> this is 1) useless; 2) stupid; 3) problematic if you don't run a VirtualHost on port 80 but DO run other services on port 80
[19:18] <bluefoxxx> Those of us pushing vhosts out with configuration management software can generally avoid messing with httpd.conf except for that
[19:19] <bluefoxxx> anyway

[19:46] <hggdh> bluefoxxx: if it affects Ubuntu, then you can open the bug here. If it is also present in Debian, you should _also_ open one in Debian, and cross-ref both
[19:47] <TheLordOfTime> what hggdh said :)
[19:47]  * TheLordOfTime was ninja'd.
[19:47] <hggdh> (it is better to have upstream fix an issue, always, and it minimises future merges)
[19:47] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: :-)
[19:48] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, you pulled the words out of my mouth about upstream... i do that with nginx all the time :P
[19:48] <TheLordOfTime> SEND: bug upstream to nginx trac.  WAIT: for patch.  APPLY: patch for SRUing.
[19:48] <TheLordOfTime> ::p
[19:48] <TheLordOfTime> speaking of which, one of my nginx servers died...  o.O
[19:48] <hggdh> sometimes I *do* pay attention to this channel ;-)
[19:48] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, :P
[19:59] <bluefoxxx> hggdh, I was more in the mind that I'm not a strictly Debian proper user, it's an extra step for me to go back
[20:00] <bluefoxxx> and interested in if it's fairly likely that opening an Ubuntu bug will get the changes propagated back to Debian if it affects Debian, due to collaboration
[20:00] <bluefoxxx> or if I should spin up a VM and test everything and see if the same bugs come from upstream
[20:01] <TheLordOfTime> typically, what i'd do is look at the debian package...
[20:01] <TheLordOfTime> and see if it exists there.
[20:01] <TheLordOfTime> already *
[20:02] <TheLordOfTime> usually i find already-filed upstream ones, but i also usually file bugs in debian if its not already filed - usually including which version of the package is affected, or the nearest equivalent one.
[20:02] <TheLordOfTime> and of course, testing the upstream package :p
[20:02] <TheLordOfTime> (of course, for PHP5 and nginx, i don't have to do that, its already done by others... xD)   (my specialization is server packages :P)
[20:02] <hggdh> but you are not *required* to open it on Debian. It would help, but it is not necessary. Eventually, someone will.
[20:03] <hggdh> meanwhile, you wait ;-)
[20:03] <TheLordOfTime> yep
[20:03] <TheLordOfTime> ... okay, either apt-mirror hates me or my system is broken..........
[20:03] <TheLordOfTime> :/
[20:06] <antiface> Hi, I'm new to this. Am I supposed to be Triaged first before coming here?
[20:06] <TheLordOfTime> no, we can help you regardless of if the bug is triaged or not :)
[20:06] <TheLordOfTime> although hggdh'll probably be more help than I right now
[20:06]  * TheLordOfTime is debugging apt-mirror
[20:07] <antiface> Ok. Thanks. I just switched to Ubuntu less than a month ago, so it's all very new to me. :)
[20:09] <antiface> I'm still gathering together a proper documentation of the problem anyway.. and it's something that's been discussed a good deal on forums..
[20:09] <yofel> TheLordOfTime: what's wrong with your apt-mirror?
[20:09]  * TheLordOfTime reads the logs
[20:09]  * TheLordOfTime facedesks
[20:10] <TheLordOfTime> lolololololololololololol... its erroring out because one of the mirrors that it mirrors is down xD
[20:10] <yofel> heh
[20:10]  * TheLordOfTime repoints the offline-mirror entry to the US regional archive
[20:11] <TheLordOfTime> s/regional/country code/
[20:11] <antiface> There must be a resource out there, a site or IRC channel for people having a hard time with audio setups?
[20:13] <bluefoxxx> ok
[20:13] <bluefoxxx> That should be a very low importance but I can't triage my own bugs.
[20:13] <TheLordOfTime> triage requires bugcontrol usually, which bug?
[20:13] <bluefoxxx> 1105411
[20:13] <TheLordOfTime> LP Bug 1105411
[20:13] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1105411 in apache2 (Ubuntu) "apache2 default conf file contains Listen directive" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1105411
[20:14] <TheLordOfTime> bugs usually need to be confirmed before we triage, but i agree on the low importance
[20:14]  * TheLordOfTime sets the bug as Low Importance
[20:14] <bluefoxxx> It's low priority because it's effectively meaningless housekeeping minimizing the configuration
[20:14] <TheLordOfTime> agreed, which is why i set it :)
[20:17] <TheLordOfTime> bluefoxxx, which releases are affected?
[20:17] <TheLordOfTime> all of em?
[20:17] <bluefoxxx> 12.10 last I looked
[20:17] <bluefoxxx> I stumbled over it trying to deploy puppetmaster-passenger from a puppet module
[20:18] <bluefoxxx> couldn't figure out how to get port 80 closed
[20:18] <bluefoxxx> manager stumbled over the same issue in RHEL6 a few hours ago because Apache was binding to 80 and breaking another server software ;p
[20:18] <TheLordOfTime> sounds like upstream issues?
[20:18] <bluefoxxx> (I guess it affects RHEL/Fedora too)
[20:19] <TheLordOfTime> if its in Ubuntu its likely in Debian, *checks debian BTS to see whether this is filed there*
[20:19] <bluefoxxx> well, the location is in httpd.conf in RHEL and ports.conf in Ubuntu, but it's probably in Ubuntu because it's in Debian
[20:19] <bluefoxxx> hence why I asked if I should test this in Debian and file there earlier, which I don't have time to do at the precise moment and which requires me to figure out where to get a Debian install ISO :)
[20:21] <TheLordOfTime> i'd file in both Ubuntu and Debian then.  i usually file in ubuntu first and triage it up to Debian where necessary, and sometimes all the way to upstream :P
[20:22] <yofel> ports.conf from SID: http://paste.kde.org/656618
[20:22] <yofel> so feel free to bug them
[20:22]  * TheLordOfTime triages to Debian
[20:23] <bluefoxxx> yofel, is it inconceivable to keep Debian packages in git?
[20:23] <bluefoxxx> like, the build tree, sans the source code
[20:23] <yofel> uh, I think the debian folks do that
[20:23] <bluefoxxx> I don't remember, but i thought that the source of a deb file was without any source code, and that it knew where the code came from, got the tar.gz, extracted it, built, packaged, etc.
[20:23] <bluefoxxx> is that still correct?
[20:23] <TheLordOfTime> yofel, 2.2.22-12, right?
[20:23] <TheLordOfTime> (what you found it on)
[20:24] <bluefoxxx> yofel,  cool, I should find their git server so I can just read through stuff there :)
[20:24] <yofel> bluefoxxx: not really, a normal debian source package is source+packaging as it doesn't need a VCS at all
[20:24] <bluefoxxx> yofel, it's notable that the Listen 443 thing is broken in newest httpd anyway
[20:25] <yofel> but there is a git plugin I believe that does exactly what you're saying
[20:25] <bluefoxxx> I think.  SOmething is.
[20:25] <bluefoxxx> Like, SSL won't inherit SSL configuration directives from the global space in virtualhost anymore, which is funny.  It broke our Web server here when I tried to migrate it.  8)
[20:25] <bluefoxxx> but I know awk
[20:25] <yofel> TheLordOfTime: 2.2.22-12 yeah
[20:25] <bluefoxxx> which is Unix kungfu
[20:26]  * yofel solved *that* with c&p as he only had one host there
[20:26] <yofel> but yeah, I did notice that -.-
[20:28] <yofel> bluefoxxx: I think you're looking for http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=pkg-apache/apache2.git;a=summary btw
[20:28] <yofel> seems to be the full source too though
[20:29] <bluefoxxx> excellent
[20:32] <TheLordOfTime> i shall return, i have to disappear because of reboot :/

[21:35] <TheLordOfTime> bluefoxxx, well if you can divert your attention
[21:35] <TheLordOfTime> someonie responded on the debian bug
[21:35] <bluefoxxx> because for a few days, RHEL will not be so much of a pile of crap.
[21:36] <bluefoxxx> TheLordOfTime, from what I can tell the Listen directive is completely unneeded at all
[21:36] <TheLordOfTime> if you have email you can respond :P
[21:36] <bluefoxxx> ok
[21:37] <TheLordOfTime> email 698967@bugs.debian.org to respond.  you may want to point out if you're the poster of the ubuntu bug too
[21:37] <TheLordOfTime> since all i did was "triage" it to debian
[21:39] <bluefoxxx> TheLordOfTime, I must have missed something somewhere.  Trying to figure out what I did.
[21:39] <TheLordOfTime> :)
[21:40] <bluefoxxx> TheLordOfTime, I think I'm completely wrong :(
[21:41] <bluefoxxx> Apache listens on whatever it's told to listen on, whether or not there is actually a virtual host listening there.  It doesn't cry that you have a VirtualHost listening on another port that it's not listening on, doesn't open the port, and will cry if you're not listening on any ports.  Blah.
[21:43] <TheLordOfTime> bluefoxxx, so... notabug and i should have it invalid'd in debian and invalid it in  ubuntu?  :P
[21:43]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[21:43] <TheLordOfTime> apache, while being a server package, isn't on my list of favorite packages :P
[21:45] <bluefoxxx> probably.
[21:54] <bluefoxxx> responded
[22:14] <bluefoxxx> made a fool of myself now
[22:15] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[22:17] <TheLordOfTime> bluefoxxx, don't forget to mark that on the debian bug as well, 698967@bugs.debian.org :P
[22:17] <bluefoxxx> i replied to the debian bug
[22:17] <bluefoxxx> i should probably put something on the launchpad bug
[22:17] <bluefoxxx> or not do this crap while I'm doing 40 other things at work
[22:17] <TheLordOfTime> someone already did on the lp bug

[22:20] <TheLordOfTime> bluefoxxx, i'm going to assume that comment was yours.
[22:20] <bluefoxxx> DA
[22:20] <TheLordOfTime> i'm forwarding to debian, with the suggestion to mark it as invalid or similar.
[22:25] <bluefoxxx> i think it got there by way of e-mail to the list
[22:25] <bluefoxxx> ...
[22:25] <bluefoxxx> I have no idea what I did, all I know is I saw an e-mail and I hit reply.
[22:26] <bluefoxxx> TheLordOfTime, just send them 'nevermind, end user is incompetent'
[22:26] <bluefoxxx> that should get the point across
[22:29] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[22:29] <TheLordOfTime> doesn't matter.
[22:29] <TheLordOfTime> i've already sent the message along :)
[22:29] <TheLordOfTime> we tend to be nicer than just "INCOMPETENT! </banrifle?>"
[22:29] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[22:34] <TheLordOfTime> bluefoxxx, i suggested that they close the bug as won'tfix or notabug.
[22:34] <TheLordOfTime> they did so :)
[22:34] <TheLordOfTime> and i politely suggested that :)
