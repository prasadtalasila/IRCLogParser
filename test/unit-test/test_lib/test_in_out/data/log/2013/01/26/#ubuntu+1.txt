[08:24] <Walther> ...is it true that Rhythmbox, the default music player in Ubuntu, can't fetch album info / id3's from the internet *at all*?
[08:25] <Walther> What good is the "extract to library" feature to rip my legally purchased cd's to FLAC's if I can't get anything else than Unknown artist - Unknown album etc

[12:22] <drhalan> rye: i would expect that such bugfixes will be backported if they stick with 3.7
[12:33] <john___> Since yesterday update of kubuntu-desktop 13.04 a FUSE gvfs filesystem keeps poping up
[12:34] <john___> though without files and no write-rights ... how can I get more info about that gfvs where it is actually poiting at?
[12:37] <john___> mount says: gvfsd-fuse on /run/user/john/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=john)
[12:39] <penguin42> gvfs-info ?
[12:49] <john___> penguin42 had to install gvfs-bin before ... gvfs-info has no output
[13:17] <penguin42> john___: Not sure, how about something like gvfs-info /run/user/john/gvfs ?
[13:19] <john___> penguin42 there is only file system information, however my primary system is KDE so there might be some missunderstanding sice the switch from .gfvs to /run/user/<login>/gvfs
[13:23] <penguin42> yeh, not rebooted yet after todays update
[14:04] <smallfoot-> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+3.0/3.6.4-0ubuntu2/+build/4247991
[14:04] <smallfoot-> Why don't I have this update yet?
[14:04] <penguin42> do you have the proposed repo enabled?
[14:06] <BluesKaj> Howdy folks
[14:06] <smallfoot-> i had, but then it showed kernel upgrade and python upgrade, but not gtk update, so i disabled proposed again
[14:08] <smallfoot-> wow now its in proposed, it wasnt last time i checked
[14:10] <smallfoot-> why does raring have a proposed even before final version is released?
[14:11] <jtaylor> so installability is tested
[14:15] <smallfoot-> oh
[14:18] <smallfoot-> Why is not Cinnamon available in the repository?
[14:18] <penguin42> it is
[14:19] <penguin42> my machine shows 1.6.7-1 available in universe
[14:20] <smallfoot-> oh it is!!
[14:20] <smallfoot-> thanks, great
[14:20] <smallfoot-> it wasnt last time i checked
[14:25] <smallfoot-> cinnamon depends on caribou :S
[15:21] <smallfoot-> Why is not Qt 5 in repo?
[15:23] <bekks> smallfoot-: cinnamon is a part of Mint, not Ubuntu. And QT5 is just too young.
[15:24] <penguin42> bekks: Cinnamon is now in universe
[15:24] <smallfoot-> just cuz mint made cinnamon doesn't mean ubuntu cant have it too
[15:24] <penguin42> bekks: Come in via Debian
[15:24] <bekks> penguin42: wow :)
[15:24] <smallfoot-> yeah, now cinnamon is in universe
[15:24] <smallfoot-> and i bet many ppl prefer cinnamon over gnome-shell or unity
[15:24] <smallfoot-> and qt5 is young, but so?
[15:24] <smallfoot-> everything start young, it can still be put in repo
[15:24] <bekks> smallfoot-: So it is in the repos, tp answer your question. :)
[15:24] <smallfoot-> ya
[15:24] <penguin42> smallfoot-: I guess it will arrive but it's just a matter of time
[15:24] <smallfoot-> but why isnt q5 in universe?
[15:25] <smallfoot-> oki
[15:25] <bekks> and qt5 is just a few days old.
[15:25] <smallfoot-> its more than 30 days old
[15:25] <penguin42> smallfoot-: Someone has to do the work to package it
[15:25] <bekks> And YOU havent packaged it yet? Shame on you.
[15:25] <smallfoot-> oh
[15:25] <smallfoot-> :(
[15:25] <penguin42> bekks: Sorry, I'm a bit slow...
[15:26] <bekks> penguin42: We're payingjust too much ;)

[16:45] <mortal_> is it a known bug that pidgin does not connect tomsn
[16:48] <penguin42> bug 1072817 perhaps?
[16:48] <ubottu> bug 1072817 in telepathy-haze (Ubuntu) "msn chat will not connect" [Low,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1072817
[16:49] <penguin42> hmm
[16:49] <penguin42> why did lp give me that bug even though I included pidgin in the search term?
[17:31] <bjsnider> penguin42, you search lp directly or you googled it?
[17:31] <bjsnider> pidgin has nothing to do with telepathy btw
[17:45] <smallfoot-> Ubuntu has Weston 1.0.3, yesterday 1.0.4 was released, will raring get updated to it?
[17:45] <bekks> Most likely no.
[18:39] <penguin42> bjsnider: Directly
[19:10] <Bluefoxicy> where do I see what packages are on 13.04?
[19:10] <Bluefoxicy> I want to see if they moved to the latest Puppet (2.7 is old and busted)

[19:13] <TheLordOfTime> ^ like that
[19:13] <Bluefoxicy> ahhhh damn
[19:13] <Bluefoxicy> too late for a bump?
[19:14] <Bluefoxicy> 3.0 has been out since September 2012
[19:14] <Bluefoxicy> and puppet is in main
[19:14] <Bluefoxicy> but it's dismally close to 13.04 and I forget when version freezes go into effect

[19:21] <ubottu> Bluefoxicy: Raring Ringtail (13.04) release milestones can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule
[19:22] <yofel> there's still a good month to get it in
[19:22] <Bluefoxicy> oh
[19:23] <yofel> then we're at feature freeze. If there's a good reason to get it in you can theoretically get it in till final freeze, needs an exception guaranteed then
[19:27] <Bluefoxicy> http://packages.debian.org/sid/puppet it's lagging in sid
[19:38]  * Bluefoxicy would also like to see nginx with passenger but that may be a bit much to ask.

[23:35] <penguin42> does anyone know on kde how to get the menus that pop up not to be transparent - they're unreadable against my black terminals
[23:36] <penguin42> pop up from the panel that is
[23:46] <vivid> penguin42: havent used kde in some time, but you can configure your theme quite a bit
[23:46] <vivid> search around in the system settings or ask in #kubuntu
[23:52] <penguin42> yeh just not found that particular one yet
[23:53] <vivid> kde is can be hard to dig through, lots of features and settings
[23:53]  * penguin42 likes it
