[00:20] <neuro> grrr, sky
[00:25] <daftykins> *shakes fist toward the heavens*
[00:25] <daftykins> what's it done? :)
[00:25] <neuro> dropped me offline for 10 mins
[00:25] <neuro> and just as i was swinging my LAN across to BT, it came back
[00:26] <neuro> i really need to get pfsense up and running with proper connection monitoring
[00:28] <daftykins> two ISPs?
[00:28] <neuro> ya
[00:28] <neuro> sky fibre unlimited pro and bt infinity 2
[00:28] <daftykins> this an office?
[00:28] <neuro> 2x 80Mbps down, 2x 20Mbps up
[00:29] <neuro> no
[00:29] <daftykins> how rather greedy
[00:29] <solarcloud_3scrn> nuro,can you torrent ?
[00:29] <neuro> greedy
[00:29] <neuro> ?
[00:29] <neuro> solarcloud_3scrn: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
[00:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> are you allowed to torrent ?
[00:30] <neuro> sure
[00:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> sweet.
[00:30] <neuro> sky is a completely unlimited connection with no FUP
[00:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> \fUP ?
[00:30] <neuro> BT say they'll throttle p2p at peak times, but unlimited otherwise
[00:30] <neuro> Fair Use Policy
[00:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> ok
[00:31] <neuro> but i tend to encrypt torrent traffic, so i've never seen BT throttle my traffic
[00:31] <daftykins> yeah it sounds a bit much for one user
[00:31] <solarcloud_3scrn> i didn't think you could torrent in the UK, that's all.
[00:31] <neuro> lol wut?
[00:31] <daftykins> lol? of course you can, it's a protocol not a law
[00:31] <solarcloud_3scrn> oh OK.
[00:32] <neuro> torrenting copyrighted material is illegal (copyright infringement)
[00:32] <neuro> but that's the same as transferring copyrighted material over http
[00:32] <neuro> or nntp
[00:32] <neuro> or ftp
[00:32] <neuro> or through the post
[00:32] <neuro> the medium isn't the issue
[00:32] <neuro> why do you think ubuntu (from a london-based company) allows you to torrent their ISOs?
[00:33] <neuro> daftykins: and why do you think it's greedy or too much for one user?
[00:33] <solarcloud_3scrn> so if I got sky unlimited pro .. I wouldn't have any monitors at the ISP, right ?
[00:33] <neuro> solarcloud_3scrn: they adhere to uk legislation
[00:34] <neuro> so they block stuff according to the iwf cleanfeed
[00:34] <daftykins> neuro: must cost a bit :) mostly 'cause i get by on 16Mb down i guess
[00:34] <neuro> and they were legally required to block the pirate bay
[00:34] <solarcloud_3scrn> so that's a No, then.
[00:34] <neuro> but apart from that you can do what you like, within legal limits of course
[00:34] <neuro> most ISPs don't actually "monitor" what you're doing, they have better things to do
[00:35] <neuro> this is why ISPs have generally resisted government calls for ISPs to police their users activities
[00:35] <solarcloud_3scrn> does it matter if you have a VPN ?
[00:35] <AlanBell> indeed, mostly what ISPs want you to do is not phone them. Just quietly pay the bill, and don't break anything.
[00:35] <neuro> what do you mean "does it matter"?
[00:36] <solarcloud_3scrn> will you still be picked up. ??
[00:36] <neuro> "picked up"?
[00:36] <neuro> ISPs don't watch what you're doing
[00:36] <solarcloud_3scrn> as a ill. downloader .
[00:36] <neuro> whether or not a third party will try to track torrent activity by connecting to trackers is another matter
[00:36] <neuro> then again, this is why i generally don't use public trackers *cough*
[00:37] <solarcloud_3scrn> k
[00:37] <neuro> i recall downloading an episode of Battlestar Galactica the morning after it aired in the US
[00:37] <neuro> took me 30 minutes to download it
[00:37] <neuro> as soon as it was finished, i stopped the torrent and quit my client
[00:37] <neuro> three days later, i had one of those "oi, you were downloading battlestar.galactica.blah.blah.mkv, stop it" emails
[00:38] <solarcloud_3scrn> .. yeah, we don't have that here .. IoM.
[00:39] <neuro> granted this was years ago, but since then i make sure i use private trackers, and use the encrypted-peers-only option in my clients and ... something else, forgotten :P
[00:39] <solarcloud_3scrn> we pay an extra gov. rate that goes to the film/ entert. industry .. £1 a month I think.
[00:40] <neuro> errr
[00:40] <neuro> ok?
[00:40] <solarcloud_3scrn> solves that one , hay ?
[00:41] <neuro> you sure about that?
[00:41] <solarcloud_3scrn> yep.
[00:41] <solarcloud_3scrn> i dloaded terrabytes since 2044 ...
[00:41] <solarcloud_3scrn> **2004.
[00:41] <ormiret> solarcloud_3scrn: where are you?
[00:42] <solarcloud_3scrn> Isle of Man.
[00:42] <solarcloud_3scrn> Mark lives down the road.
[00:42] <neuro> can you cite something that you're talking about?
[00:42] <daftykins> solarcloud_3scrn: why are you asking so many shifty questions?
[00:43] <solarcloud_3scrn> the law .. i did have a youtube vid. but I've lost it.
[00:43] <solarcloud_3scrn> just seeing if the UK is worth it .. seems it's not.
[00:43] <neuro> well if a youtube video said it ... ;)
[00:44] <daftykins> to move to?
[00:44] <neuro> wait, you're saying the uk isn't worth living in because of robust copyright infringement controls?
[00:44] <solarcloud_3scrn> (it was a politcian ).
[00:44] <solarcloud_3scrn> yep.
[00:44] <solarcloud_3scrn> we dont have that law here.
[00:44] <neuro> wat?!
[00:45] <solarcloud_3scrn> yeh , I'm watching 7 psycopaths right now.
[00:45] <neuro> i could be watching it as well, it's sitting on my nas right now
[00:46] <solarcloud_3scrn> manx.. it's a freedom to florish..
[00:46] <daftykins> solarcloud_3scrn: i'm in the Channel Islands, most of the law is copied over from England. i'd be surprised if you're as exempt as you think you are
[00:46] <neuro> you're right
[00:47] <solarcloud_3scrn> well n-one has ever questioned/ emailed me .. and I have proof that no one has been prosecuted. i know a lawyer.
[00:47] <neuro> IoM has a lot of UK copyright law and agreements extended to it
[00:47] <neuro> and
[00:47] <neuro> all the articles i'm finally finding about this
[00:47] <neuro> are for a *proposal* for a £1/mo tax to permit unlimited MUSIC usage in IoM
[00:47] <neuro> all from around jan/feb 2009
[00:48] <daftykins> i've heard people get letters / emails / phone calls from our main ISP when they're using public torrents. if you do that you might as well phone the RIAA/MPAA and tell 'em what you've been getting
[00:48] <daftykins> public = fail
[00:48] <neuro> :)
[00:48] <solarcloud_3scrn> gotta go . the films getting to a goodie ...
[00:48] <neuro> well before you go
[00:48] <daftykins> enjoy
[00:48] <neuro> just bear in mind i think you're operating under a falsehood
[00:49] <neuro> you're just as liable when downloading infringing material in the IoM as you are in the UK
[00:49] <neuro> you just haven't been caught yet :)
[00:51] <neuro> i honestly can't find anything that says this was implemented
[00:54] <neuro> yeah, i don't think this ever happened
[00:54] <neuro> http://www.isleofman.com/News/details/36724/music-download-deal-a-long-way-off-
[00:54] <daftykins> it does sound unlikely to be granted
[00:55] <daftykins> neuro: what do you pay for each of those services?
[00:55] <neuro> um
[00:55] <neuro> iirc 30 for sky, 26 for bt
[00:55] <neuro> plus line rental for both
[00:55] <daftykins> daym
[00:56] <daftykins> they do VDSL over here now, 40Mb/2Mb - £35/mo with line rental £9.70/m ish
[00:56] <daftykins> no caps or FUP either
[00:56] <neuro> "here"?
[00:56] <daftykins> Guernsey
[00:56] <neuro> right
[00:56] <neuro> well that's what sky's initial offering was
[00:56] <neuro> 40 down 2 up
[00:56] <daftykins> yeah i want more upload for sure =/
[00:56] <neuro> i speed bumped mine when sky announced pro (80/20)
[00:56]  * ormiret waits very impatiently to get anything beyond ADSL2
[00:56] <daftykins> useless for hosting things from home without :>
[00:57] <daftykins> ormiret: where are you? :)
[00:57] <neuro> probably somewhere that openreach hasn't enabled cabs for vdsl yet
[00:57] <ormiret> Aberdeen; there is better in some of the city but not for me yet.
[00:57] <daftykins> ah
[00:58] <neuro> ah yer a chuchter!
[00:58] <daftykins> i've never been up north. everyone always says not to bother...
[00:58] <neuro> WAT?
[00:58] <neuro> aberdeen is awesome
[00:58] <neuro> it has a beach and everything
[00:58] <daftykins> i've enough beaches where i am :>
[00:58] <neuro> lol
[00:59] <ormiret> You probably don't get much ice on your beaches though.
[00:59] <daftykins> nope rarely there's any snow over here, if any settles it's only overnight and melts quite quickly
[00:59] <daftykins> though there was enough for a sled run down a hill back in '96
[01:00] <daftykins> that was the only proper snow i've seen in my life
[01:03] <neuro> aww, bless :)
[01:06] <daftykins> well, locally i should qualify
[01:06] <daftykins> went snowboarding last March ^_^
[01:11] <solarcloud_3scrn> did you use gnu.com ??
[01:20] <solarcloud_3scrn> just ordered another programming book .. and a lead for my Amilo/fujitsu off amazon .. hope it worx well.
[01:21] <solarcloud_3scrn> they alway say I could have it by Friday.. then when i've bought; say the delivery could take 14 days ! .. go figure.
[01:22] <neuro> because the amazon default is to assume if you use 1-day delivery and you're in the UK, you'll get it on friday
[01:22] <solarcloud_3scrn> hope so.
[01:22] <neuro> you *could* have it by friday ... if you pay extra ... and you're in the UK
[01:22] <daftykins> solarcloud_3scrn: what's the IoM postal service like? slow/fast?
[01:22] <solarcloud_3scrn> same .. we dnt have secong class post though.
[01:22] <daftykins> ours is pretty bad and gone down to 5 deliveries a week since LVCR (low value consignment relief) got made unlawful
[01:22] <daftykins> HMV's warehouse closed
[01:22] <daftykins> play.com just closed
[01:23] <daftykins> (they were based out of Jersey)
[01:23] <solarcloud_3scrn> yeah , I think Jersey is pretty screwed asfar as a VAT juristiction . too many overlords IMHO.
[01:24] <solarcloud_3scrn> Is the customer service at shops generally kack or ok ?
[01:25] <solarcloud_3scrn> IoM.. has the worst in EU by far.
[01:25] <daftykins> what shops where?
[01:25] <solarcloud_3scrn> in Jersey.
[01:25] <daftykins> i don't live there
[01:25] <solarcloud_3scrn> right.
[01:26] <daftykins> i'm on Guernsey, but most low jobs like retail are done by Latvian immigrants now
[01:26] <solarcloud_3scrn> sounds familiar.
[01:26] <daftykins> so you get what you can explain between languages ^_^
[01:27] <solarcloud_3scrn> do you know a property website for the channel islands ?
[01:27] <daftykins> i just recently bought a house, there were over 15 for my island alone
[01:27] <daftykins> trust me it's pricey :)
[01:28] <daftykins> start with www.martelmaides.co.uk
[01:28] <solarcloud_3scrn> opening...
[01:28] <daftykins> you'll need to select either open or local market, local market are local houses for LOCAL PEOPLE! as the phrase goes
[01:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> so it's £700k , basically.
[01:31] <daftykins> errr no
[01:31] <daftykins> what did you look at?
[01:32] <solarcloud_3scrn> http://www.martelmaides.co.uk/properties?filter[market]=Open&filter[rent_or_buy]=Buy&filter[minimum_bedrooms]=1&filter[parish]=any&filter[price_range]=0-1000000
[01:34] <daftykins> oh, open
[01:34] <daftykins> ooh that first one is on the smaller island of Sark too
[01:34] <solarcloud_3scrn> well I'm not local, am I ?
[01:34] <daftykins> hope you like horse and carriage rides
[01:34] <solarcloud_3scrn> how much d you think the first one is worth ?
[01:35] <daftykins> i'm too youthful to have any practical knowledge
[01:35] <daftykins> Sark is different, nobody's allowed to own a house over there
[01:35] <solarcloud_3scrn> surething.
[01:35] <daftykins> you can only sort of - hold a mortgage for a set period of time as far as i understand
[01:35] <daftykins> were you born on the IoM or are you originally from the US?
[01:36] <solarcloud_3scrn> no I'm manx.
[01:36] <solarcloud_3scrn> born here.
[01:37] <solarcloud_3scrn> I think there  are still direct AFAs I know.
[01:37] <solarcloud_3scrn> **direct flights..
[01:38] <daftykins> AFA 0o
[01:38] <daftykins> that a local term?
[01:38] <solarcloud_3scrn> as far as ...
[01:40] <solarcloud_3scrn> there isn't much of a hacking community here ..
[01:40]  * solarcloud_3scrn must change that ... (Ment. note :)
[01:41] <solarcloud_3scrn> whats it like on Guernsey ??
[01:41] <daftykins> err
[01:41] <daftykins> simple
[01:41] <solarcloud_3scrn> guess not.
[01:42] <daftykins> 'hacking' ? :P
[01:42] <solarcloud_3scrn> yeah.
[01:42] <solarcloud_3scrn> like a hackspace etc ..
[01:43] <daftykins> are you talking about the general messing around with technology, or the unlawful gaining access kind? :)
[01:43] <daftykins> the term has been utterly destroyed by the media of late
[01:43] <solarcloud_3scrn> 1st.
[01:44] <daftykins> ah there's no community here
[01:44] <daftykins> some of the UK bunch in here recommended starting a LUG
[01:44] <solarcloud_3scrn> yeah, we do have a LUG..
[01:44] <daftykins> doing better than here then
[01:45] <solarcloud_3scrn> always needs fresh blood for the grinder, as always.
[01:45] <solarcloud_3scrn> It's strange, because everyone uses computers, but no-one questions them .. odd really.
[01:46] <solarcloud_3scrn> I blame warranties..
[01:47] <ormiret> It's much the same for non-computer things too. Very few people know much about how their car works.
[01:48] <solarcloud_3scrn> true. i dont, but  I wanna electric one
[01:48]  * solarcloud_3scrn scans ebay/uk for an electric car .....
[01:50] <solarcloud_3scrn> mm 49 electric cars .. £3.5k to £32k .. no tesla cars yet :(
[01:52] <daftykins> i don't think any electric car designer has thought properly long-long term about their creations
[01:52] <daftykins> so the batteries die and you do... what exactly? :D
[01:52] <neuro> walk

[01:57] <solarcloud_3scrn> they should open source the whole thing ;)
[01:58] <daftykins> your english is so incredibly incoherent, i don't quite get why it is o0
[01:59] <solarcloud_3scrn> soz about that ..
[01:59] <solarcloud_3scrn> Perhaps .. these aren't the droids you are looking for ....
[02:00] <daftykins> does anyone actually speak the local gaelic over there?
[02:00] <neuro> they should open source a car?
[02:00] <neuro> oh good grief

[02:00] <solarcloud_3scrn> yes and Yes, definately.

[02:07] <neuro> deliveries of model S in UK begin mid 2013
[02:07] <solarcloud_3scrn> sounds good.

[02:08] <neuro> https://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/own#/model-s
[02:08] <solarcloud_3scrn> how much is the cheapest ?it's $50k in us ??
[02:09] <neuro> yup
[02:09] <solarcloud_3scrn> what's that £35k here, then ?

[07:45] <daftykins> nice big hex error trying to run notepad of all programs :>
[07:45] <daftykins> yet i continued typing on irssi via KiTTY and playing an HD TV ep over the network 0o
[08:43] <dwatkins> sounds like a hardware problem
[08:43] <dwatkins> or was this not an actual OS crash, daftykins?
[08:43] <daftykins> lolz
[08:44] <daftykins> yeah it went like that then BSOD'd
[08:44] <daftykins> :D
[08:44] <daftykins> i'm on the same system again right now as if nothing happened
[08:44] <dwatkins> heh, I've even had Windows 8 BSOD on me a couple times, but I wasn't entirely surprised.
[08:45] <daftykins> i can't comment on 8, but i've never had any BSODs on XP or 7 that haven't been hardware/overclocking related
[08:45] <daftykins> overclocking being something FAR in my past :)
[08:48] <dwatkins> likewise, I suspect it might have been related to some driver I was installing that wasn't properly compatible with Win8.
[08:49] <daftykins> ah
[08:50] <daftykins> yeah i'm not sure what to make of this one
[08:50] <daftykins> i've seen the intel X25-M G2 SSD i've got fail to be detected by BIOS twice, i just power cycle and back she comes
[08:51] <dwatkins> even in IDE mode?
[08:51] <dwatkins> just wondering if that might indicate a software/firmware problem as opposed to a hardware problem. It's obviously not having an issue spinning-up in time ;)

[09:00] <dwatkins> I don't remove my cap when doffing it.
[09:00] <dwatkins> Clearly I'm not doing it right.

[09:57] <Azelphur> My router is running dd-wrt
[09:58] <daftykins> why would you do that D:
[09:59] <Azelphur> daftykins: I have one machine which is both server, and tv
[09:59] <Azelphur> but later on I may split it into two separate boxes
[09:59] <directhex> you can't give a computer 2 hostnames, but you can make it resolve from more than one thing depending on the DNS setup you use
[09:59] <daftykins> or just hax your hosts file
[09:59] <Azelphur> I wonder if I can just hax the hosts file in dd-wrt
[10:00] <directhex> what DNS server runs on dd-wrt?
[10:00] <directhex> i'd guess dnsmasq
[10:00] <Azelphur> yep, dnsmasq
[10:02] <Azelphur> looks like it doesn't
[10:02] <Azelphur> directhex: with dnsmasq, I tried adding address=/tv/192.168.1.11
[10:03] <Azelphur> which worked, but had the side effect of also hijacking *.tv
[10:03] <daftykins> do i go play with RAID or do i go to sleep, hrmm
[10:03] <Azelphur> so, everything.tv would resolve to 192.168.1.11 lol
[10:03] <daftykins> hehehe :D
[10:03] <daftykins> nothing like messing with storage setups when sleep deprived amirite?
[10:06] <Azelphur> oh hey, hosts file hack works
[10:06] <daftykins> two entries for each name at the same IP?
[10:07] <daftykins> no reason it wouldn't
[10:07] <Azelphur> yep
[10:09] <daftykins> heh i was trying to do the same on a mac recently and it wasn't working, then i realise i had the IP and name the wrong way 'round :(
[10:15] <dw4tkins> I use dnsmasq, Azelphur - it uses the hosts file and a nice simple little config file to setup an DHCP and DNS server for a small network
[10:15] <Azelphur> cool
[10:16] <Azelphur> well yea, got it working with my hosts hack now, which is good my nfc tags are back working :P
[10:22] <daftykins> \o/
[10:22] <daftykins> to the celebratorium!
[10:25] <daftykins> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9f90x9L1W1qzs532o1_250.jpg
[10:25] <daftykins> omg.
[10:33] <dw4tkins> That's awesome, daftykins
[10:37] <daftykins> dw4tkins: :D
[10:39] <brobostigon> good morning everyone,
[10:40] <dw4tkins> wotcher brobostigon, how's the Pi?
[10:42] <brobostigon> dw4tkins: go it to output fine, except for one thing, there is a band on the left hand side, that is cut off by the tv, and i cant quite work out, hot to get it right.
[10:42] <brobostigon> got*
[10:43] <brobostigon> how*
[10:44] <daftykins> had some overscan troubles?
[10:44] <brobostigon> dw4tkins: i know it is a parameter in /boot/config* but i cant work out what, i think, or a parameter in its xorg.conf.
[10:44] <dw4tkins> hmm, not just a case of selecting the relevant zoom mode on the TV?
[10:45] <brobostigon> daftykins: is that what it is called, ah.
[10:45] <dw4tkins> I assume you're booting with the TV already connected and switched to that input
[10:45] <daftykins> when the picture falls off the sides ja
[10:45] <brobostigon> dw4tkins: yep.
[10:45] <dw4tkins> there's an IRC channel, #raspberrypi - they should know
[10:47] <brobostigon> both are set to 4/3
[10:47] <brobostigon> dw4tkins: ok, i will ask them.
[10:48] <brobostigon> daftykins: so i adjust the overscan parameters?
[10:48] <daftykins> er well not for just one side being funny
[10:48] <dw4tkins> iirc you need to be registered to have voice in #raspberrypi
[10:48] <daftykins> usually overscan by either the TV or device is when the picture looks like it's been zoomed in on
[10:49] <daftykins> so that it's 'off' on all 4 sides
[10:49] <brobostigon> daftykins: nothing is missing, but on that left side.
[10:49] <daftykins> definitely persists across 'reboots' ?
[10:49] <brobostigon> yes.
[10:50] <daftykins> how funky. could be worth playing with the TV options, i don't own an r-pi though so the channel might be the best route to take
[10:50] <brobostigon> or i just try a different format like 16/9 ?
[10:51] <daftykins> i'd have thought you'd be in 16:9 mode already if that's the aspect ratio of your TV
[10:51] <brobostigon> the normal, i jjust checked for it, is/was set to 4/3
[10:52] <daftykins> i'd say 16:9 was normal these days :) 4:3 aspect is ghettooooo!
[10:52] <popey> surely you're using composite?
[10:53] <brobostigon> ok, i will try 16:9.
[10:53] <brobostigon> popey: i am, yes.
[10:53] <popey> set resolution to 720x576?
[10:53] <popey> http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=8265
[10:53] <popey> all well documented on their forums
[10:53] <brobostigon> ah, i will try that, thank you popey
[10:53] <daftykins> oh i was more just being a semantic pedant. i was assuming you were on a modern LCD TV over HDMI
[10:54] <daftykins> composite, ouchies

[11:23] <d3ngar> Hi there, I'm struggling with a mysql "select into outfile"
[11:24] <d3ngar> Some research suggested that this has something to do with apparmor and that I need to whitelist directories for mysqld>
[11:24] <d3ngar> But I have done this, restarted both mySQL and Apparmor and I still can't write to a file
[11:24] <d3ngar> Errcode: 13
[11:24] <d3ngar> Any clues?
[11:26] <dw4tkins> does the account under which the SQL daemon is running have permission to write the file, d3ngar?
[11:27] <popey> http://www.solid-run.com/cubox
[11:29] <d3ngar> dw4tkins: yes, absolutley
[11:29] <d3ngar> The folder is ~/Public/
[11:29] <d3ngar> NAd i chmod it to 777
[11:29] <dw4tkins> d3ngar: is the daemon running as the user?
[11:29] <dw4tkins> ah ok, in that case all I can suggest is checking the SQL server logs
[11:30] <d3ngar> The deamon? the deamon of mysql is running as mysql
[11:31] <diplo> d3ngar: I had that... new issue I believe with mysqk5 something
[11:31] <diplo> Have to add a setting to my.cnf
[11:31]  * diplo looks up
[11:31] <xnox> my postman just told me I buy too much from amazon.
[11:32] <d3ngar> dw4tkins: I checked the logs, they are empty
[11:32] <d3ngar> diplo: thanks!
[11:32] <Laney> I have started to recognise the delivery people by their different knocks
[11:32] <dw4tkins> xnox: my postwoman (our receptionist) regularly pokes fun at me for this
[11:33] <xnox> Laney: =))))
[11:33] <Azelphur> I'm using xfce, does anyone know how I'd tell it to use the gnome screensaver?
[11:33] <diplo> It sort of worked, ( just jogging memory ) but still had issues partially, moved the code to mysqli php statement
[11:33] <xnox> time of delivery as well.
[11:33] <Laney> xnox: ordered something nice?
[11:34] <xnox> nah just crap: little miss sunshine bug for my sister birthday, non-tangle headphones, life in uk (study guide for citizenship), a backpack.....
[11:34] <d3ngar> That's ridicolous: I can't really write a script for this piping out 40m lines!
[11:34] <Laney> haha
[11:34] <d3ngar> I just need to do this once
[11:34] <Laney> pity you having to do that citizenship test
[11:35] <diplo> You just using cli at the mo d3ngar  ?
[11:35] <d3ngar> yes
[11:35] <d3ngar> I also have the GUI and other tools, but for the size of the outfile, it would be good to do this a very simple way
[11:35] <d3ngar> So using the mysql cli is the best thing, I guess
[11:35] <dw4tkins> when the zombipocalypse happens, delivery people will have to wear bodyarmor.
[11:36] <diplo> local-infile=1 in my.cnf sort of fixed it from memory ( few months ago )
[11:36] <diplo> or can mysql --local-infile -u etc etc
[11:37] <diplo> We had this issue with a webhost after an upgrade
[11:37] <diplo> Worked fine in dev and just about everywhere apart from our web hosts :/
[11:37] <d3ngar> diplo: yes, I understand
[11:37] <d3ngar> It's fine when it's your webhost, cause you can blame them
[11:37] <diplo> That local-infile needs to be in mysql/mysqld I sections i believe
[11:38] <d3ngar> but it's your own server, then you should just expect some things to work
=== davidmarais__ is now known as davidmarais
[11:38] <diplo> Supposedly a security prevention in newer versions of mysql
[11:38] <d3ngar> BS, I say
[11:38] <diplo> And I guess set per distro on how secure they are making it
[11:38] <d3ngar> Why the h*ll would mysqldump then still work fine?
[11:39] <d3ngar> I just don't want to use MySQL dump, cause it prints so much extra rubbish in the file that I'd have to clear
[11:39] <d3ngar> simple select command does this work much better and you can choose your own delimiter
[11:39] <d3ngar> (mine's a pipe)
[11:39] <ormiret> mysqldump is the client accessing files, the infile stuff is for the server doing that.
[11:40] <d3ngar> ormiret: fair point!
[11:41] <d3ngar> local-infile=1 still didn't work
[11:41] <brobostigon> ok, that kinda works, in 16:9 at 720:576, but it is still going over the edges. hmmm,
[11:42] <d3ngar> Is there really no other way than writing a script?
[11:42] <popey> overscan...
[11:42] <d3ngar> Why do I have to resort to Python to do something that should be straightforward?
[11:42] <brobostigon> popey: ok, so i just adjust those overscan parameters that are in config.txt ?
[11:43] <popey> I assume so
[11:43] <brobostigon> ok.
[11:43] <brobostigon> let me try.
[11:44] <diplo> d3ngar: You doing something like mysql -h ... -u ... db -e 'Select foo from bar' > /tmp/file.txt type dump ?

[11:48] <mungbean> anyone know of an rkhunter for windows?
[11:49] <dw4tkins> rkhunter?
[11:49] <mgdm> mungbean: spybot?
[11:50] <mungbean> i have readonly mounts of a clean and compromised windows servers and want to look for rootkits on the compromised one
[11:50] <mungbean> am starting by hashing the binaries on both
[11:50] <mungbean> but there must be tools available
[11:51] <popey> isnt that what antivirus packages are for?
[11:51] <dw4tkins> I vaguely remember there was some bootable antivirus system, probably a commercial thing though.
[11:51] <popey> microsoft have a tool to do it iirc
[11:51] <popey> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/841290
[11:51] <popey>  File Checksum Integrity Verifier (FCIV)
[11:52] <mungbean> cool. i am on a linux box because i don't want to boot the machines though
[11:52] <mungbean> offline analysis
[11:52] <mungbean> maybe clamav can search it though
[11:53] <popey> or... rkhunter?
[11:53] <mungbean> i thought rkhunter only looks for linux rootkits
[11:53] <popey> it does checksumming
[11:53] <popey> so you could do the comparison thing you said you wanted
[11:57] <mungbean> sysinternals had some tools but not on server 2008
[11:57] <mungbean> since MS bought them yay
[11:58] <mungbean> gmer is a rootkit detector for win
[11:58] <mungbean> they all require booting the OS..how lame
[12:00] <diplo> mungbean: You in a rush for this ? A friend of mine does this sort of stuff all the time but away snow boarding atm
[12:00] <mungbean> yes unfortuantely
[12:01] <mungbean> however they are VMs so i will take a copy of the vm again to boot it
[12:01] <diplo> Well if you're still stuck after the weekend I can ask him
[12:01] <mungbean> maybe i'll find an irc channel for this specific issue
[12:01] <diplo> He got into it over the last 2 years with Cyber security challenge and stuff like that
[14:25] <popey> marxjohnson: has the front cover of your n7 case curled up at the corners like an old sandwich?

[14:56]  * xnox got very confused. I raised the volume in the sound indicator and the music played by phone did not increase volume.
[15:03] <mgdm> heh heh
[15:03] <mgdm> been there, done that
[15:05] <mungbean> any way to crack a password protected rar file?
[15:06] <directhex> dictionary attack?
[15:06] <mungbean> the pwned server i'm looking at involved downloading a .rar fie with a botnet kit in it
[15:07] <mungbean> can see the file listing only
[15:08] <shauno> tried googling the filenames (of the contents) and seeing if anyone's gone before you?
[15:08] <mungbean> yeah :(
[15:09] <mungbean> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1516943/
[15:10] <popey> the key is probably in the payload
[15:10] <popey> oh nice, if you unpack that it'll autorun the .bat file
[15:11] <popey> looks like http://home.mcafee.com/virusinfo/virusprofile.aspx?key=568867
[15:12] <mungbean> after that, storm is installed
[15:12] <mungbean> and a proxy is run
[15:13] <mungbean> what do u mean in english popey "the key is probably in the payload"
[15:13] <popey> well something grabbed the rar, didnt it
[15:13] <popey> that payload which pulled in the rar will have the key in it
[15:13] <popey> the password
[15:13] <mungbean> possibly a person (via rdesktop)
[15:13] <popey> really!?
[15:13] <mungbean> nothing to do with me
[15:14] <mungbean> but yes, via rdesktop
[15:14] <popey> usually there's a tiny stub which comes down from a website via XSS attack of somekind, which gets the next stage (your rar file), unpack/decrypts it and runs it
[15:14] <mungbean> hard to say the course of events
[15:14] <popey> so you might find something odd in the internet history
[15:15] <popey> surely if via rdesktop you have the event log which shows who connected and when?
[15:16] <mungbean> yes
[15:16] <mungbean> we saw that
[15:16] <mungbean> only event in internet history is 1 ip
[15:16] <mungbean> downloading the rar
[15:46] <feisar> how can I install grub when I'm running raid1?
[15:46] <feisar> grub-install /dev/sda
[15:46] <feisar> /dev/mapper/../dm-0 does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
[15:55] <dw4tkins> I suspect you need to make a /boot that's visible to the BIOS as a separate partition from the RAID array, feisar
[16:00] <feisar> dw4tkins: thanks for the reply but I just fixed it... it is possible to raid1 the whole system you just need to install grub to both drive's mbrs
[16:00] <feisar> (i did it by purging and installing grub-pc)
[16:00] <dw4tkins> aha neat, feisar - bear in mind that you probably need to do that same operation every time you update the kernel etc. so they are stil in sync
[16:00] <feisar> oh right, I hadn't thought of that
[16:01] <dw4tkins> I've seen problems like that on large systems due to manual propagation of /boot
[16:01] <feisar> yes, of course, I guess the automatic script will just install to one drive
[16:01] <dw4tkins> a disk fails, the system can't be booted because although the / filesystems were in sync, /boot wasn't
[16:01] <feisar> well I think /boot will be in my case because it's part of the raid
[16:01] <feisar> *i think
[16:02] <feisar> it's one raid device with lvm on top of it
[16:03] <dw4tkins> you may also need to be careful with what modules are loaded and when, so that it has the RAID array available to load /boot
[16:03] <dw4tkins> I'm not sure that happens by default at the moment
[16:04] <brobostigon> the bbc is predicting snow here on saturday,
[16:05] <popey> yay
[16:05] <popey> I'll be flying out on saturday
[16:06] <popey> http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/94403  \o/ sunny
[16:07] <feisar> dw4tkins: I set up raid1 and LVM using the 12.04 installer and it seems to have gone ok, I think the only manual procedure needed is to install grub to both drives
