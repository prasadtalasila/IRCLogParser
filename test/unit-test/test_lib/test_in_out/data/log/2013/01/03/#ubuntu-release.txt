[10:50] <tjaalton> there's no d-i upload using the backport stack for 12.04.2 yet?
[10:54] <cjwatson> should be in -proposed ...
[10:56] <tjaalton> oh
[10:57] <tjaalton> yeah there it is.. didn't think to check -proposed
[10:58] <tjaalton> I think there is a newer kernel available now (-35), so maybe a rebuild is in order?
[10:58] <tjaalton> uh
[10:58] <tjaalton> -21
[10:59] <cjwatson> I'd like to finish landing the SB stack first please
[10:59] <tjaalton> sure, just thinking out loud :)
[10:59] <cjwatson> stgraber: Did you ever manage to test precise images on non-SB systems of any kind?
[10:59] <cjwatson> (Or anyone else?)
[11:08] <tjaalton> cjwatson: you mean like the -proposed netboot image? I can give it a go
[11:12] <cjwatson> I meant CD images
[11:14] <tjaalton> I've installed it on a haswell system, no secure boot
[11:14] <tjaalton> before the holidays
[11:14] <cjwatson> BIOS or UEFI?
[11:15] <tjaalton> good question.. I'll check. could be bios
=== mmrazik is now known as mmrazik|afk
[11:41] <tjaalton> cjwatson: bios..
[11:45] <cjwatson> OK, thanks
[11:45] <cjwatson> Anyone done a non-SB UEFI test with current precise imageS?
[11:45] <cjwatson> *images
[11:45] <tjaalton> i'll try that next
[11:46] <cjwatson> Brilliant, thanks
[11:46] <tjaalton> hmm, maybe I should try some other image than this oem one...
[11:47] <tjaalton> and not on the beta hw :)
[11:47] <tjaalton> has issues with booting uefi it seems
=== doko_ is now known as doko
[11:54] <tjaalton> cjwatson: is it the precise/dvd/current image on cdimages.u.c?
[11:55] <tjaalton> it says 12.04.2
[11:56] <cjwatson> Yeah
[11:56] <tjaalton> ok, takes a while to download
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
=== mmrazik|afk is now known as mmrazik
[13:13] <tjaalton> cjwatson: I get "error: couldn't read file; error: you need to load the kernel first" after the grub menu
[13:14] <cjwatson> Any difference with the desktop image?
[13:14] <cjwatson> precise/daily-live/current/
[13:14] <cjwatson> and this is amd64 I presume
[13:15] <tjaalton> downloading, and yes
[13:16] <tjaalton> the oem image had the same problem
[13:16] <tjaalton> from mid-december with the new stuff on it
[13:18] <cjwatson> I'm not going to debug the OEM image since some of this stuff can depend on fine details of image construction
[13:20] <tjaalton> right, but it could be something related to the haswell firmware too. I'll ask around just to be sure
[13:21] <cjwatson> It's possible, although an outside chance
[13:27] <cjwatson> Also possibly worth comparing with 12.04.1 to see whether this is a regression
[13:42] <tjaalton> hm, the amd64+mac image I had doesn't even seem to load grub
[13:42] <cjwatson> Why are you using amd64+mac?
[13:42] <cjwatson> Its purpose is not to have UEFI support.
[13:42] <tjaalton> it's the only cd-sized image there was
[13:43] <cjwatson> It's not a valid test for this.
[13:43] <tjaalton> and I had that already
[13:43] <tjaalton> this was .1
[13:43] <tjaalton> .2 just finished downloading
[13:43] <cjwatson> http://askubuntu.com/questions/37999/what-is-different-about-the-mac-iso-image
[13:44] <cjwatson> ^- explains that amd64+mac does not have UEFI support
[13:44] <cjwatson> Does this brand-spanking-new system really have a CD-only drive?
[13:45] <tjaalton> no :)
[13:45] <tjaalton> s/cd-sized/reasonably sized/
[13:46] <tjaalton> booting off a usb stick didn't work the last time I tried
[13:46] <cjwatson> eh, the amd64 image is very similar in size to the amd64+mac image
[13:46] <cjwatson> to within noise, basically
[13:46] <tjaalton> http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04.1/release/
[13:47] <cjwatson> http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/
[13:47] <tjaalton> besides, it was just what I had on the system readily available, I'll try .2 now while .1 dvd is downloading
[13:47] <tjaalton> bah
[13:47] <tjaalton> confusing :)
[13:47] <cjwatson> (and see the link at the top of that page ...)
[13:47] <tjaalton> hah
[13:48] <tjaalton> bad/old habit of using cdimages.u.c..
[13:48] <cjwatson> current precise-desktop-amd64 works fine in kvm/uefi for me
[13:49] <cjwatson> well, gets to grub and boots the kernel
[13:50] <cjwatson> I'll do a full test install in kvm
[13:51] <cjwatson> working in kvm seems to eliminate this being an image construction bug, so I think a firmware problem has become more likely
[13:52] <tjaalton> yeah
[13:52] <tjaalton> or firmware setting bug
[13:52] <cjwatson> admittedly I've not tried the DVD yet; it'll take a couple of hours to download
[13:53] <cjwatson> the fact that grub got as far as it did for you indicates that efidisk is at least somewhat working, since it read its configuration file
[13:54] <cjwatson> check that the problem's repeatable, too
[13:55] <tjaalton> same thing with the desktop image.. trying with the usb stick now
[13:55] <tjaalton> could be a brazero issue on quantal
[13:55] <cjwatson> I use growisofs for burning DVD images
[14:04] <tjaalton> cjwatson: ha, booted fine off the usb stick, installing now
[14:07] <cjwatson> OK, good; I'd still like to know that it isn't a regression, but that's helpful
[14:07] <stgraber> cjwatson: I did one before the holidays by accident (forgot to enable SB) and it worked fine
[14:07] <tjaalton> I'll try with the growisofs-burned image next
[14:08] <cjwatson> infinity: Do you remember anything else we wanted to check before dropping in the whole lot?
[14:11] <cjwatson> I still have two other grub2 patches I want to squeeze in for .2 (one customer-requested), and am running out of time ...
=== lamont` is now known as lamont
[14:47] <tjaalton> cjwatson: not a regression, getting the same with .1
[14:47] <tjaalton> something wrong with the machine
[14:48] <tjaalton> but usb worked, installed and boots afterwards
[14:48] <cjwatson> phew (from my pov)
[14:48] <tjaalton> :)
[14:51] <tjaalton> the .2 image doesn't seem to use the xorg backport stack yet?
[14:51] <cjwatson> no, just the kernel backports
[14:51] <cjwatson> not worked out what we need to do for xorg yet
[14:53] <tjaalton> a new meta package for ubuntu-desktop, and the desktop task that installs it?
[14:55] <tjaalton> mlankhorst should know, I'll ask..
[14:57] <cjwatson> task changes are troublesome
[14:57] <cjwatson> I think we're actually going to have to switch to the metapackage; but if we change the metapackage then that upgrades existing users ...
[14:57] <cjwatson> the kernel was easier since that's already handled specially
[14:58] <tjaalton> so there's xserver-xorg-lts-quantal, but the current archive version would remove ubuntu-desktop
[14:58] <tjaalton> and there's a new version that fixes that, but not accepted yet
=== Ursinha-afk is now known as Ursinha
[15:00] <cjwatson> let's see about that
[15:00] <tjaalton> on the proposed queue I'm told..
[15:00] <cjwatson> no bug ref, makes it hard to coordinate validation?
[15:01] <tjaalton> hmm
[15:01] <cjwatson> there are occasional very routine things we do without that, but not sure this counts as routine
[15:01] <mlankhorst> hey
[15:01] <tjaalton> mlankhorst: 17:00 < cjwatson> no bug ref, makes it hard to coordinate validation?
[15:01] <tjaalton> for the xorg upload
[15:02] <mlankhorst> hm would have to check
[15:03] <mlankhorst> don't know if it had a bug or not
[15:03] <cjwatson> if not, could you create an artificial one, please?
[15:03] <cjwatson> I just want some way of ensuring that this all works together nicely
[15:04] <cjwatson> and somebody is going to have to recommend a set of installer/metapackage/whatever changes, bearing in mind upgrade effects
[15:04] <mlankhorst> so far most communication goes through me
[15:04] <mlankhorst> so felt like having a bug was confusing
[15:04] <cjwatson> for SRUs it needs to be in bugs
[15:04] <cjwatson> please
[15:05] <cjwatson> it will make things better since there'll be clear status right there on the SRU report
[15:05] <cjwatson> can't do much about the existing xorg updates; right now they're all sitting there with no way to indicate whether they're good for promotion to -updates :-/
[15:06] <cjwatson> so, the spec says that upgraders won't be pulled into the new enablement stack
[15:06] <tjaalton> right
[15:07] <mlankhorst> yeah the xorg package just allows the lts-quantal version to be coinstalled
[15:07] <cjwatson> this means we somehow need to get the images changed without touching metapackages
[15:07] <tjaalton> but the .2 image needs to have some way to pull xorg-lts-quantal
[15:07] <tjaalton> which then provides 'xorg' for ubuntu-desktop
[15:07] <cjwatson> this is kind of horribly out of spec for the image building tools - but there may be some ways to achieve it
[15:08] <mlankhorst> erm
[15:08] <mlankhorst> xorg can install just fine
[15:08] <mlankhorst> it's just the xserver-xorg that will conflict with xserver-xorg-lts-quantal
[15:08] <cjwatson> I can't really do anything until the SB stack lands, at risk of entangling the two
[15:08] <cjwatson> sure, but that doesn't address the image building problem
[15:09] <cjwatson> it makes it possible to do something without breaking upgraders, yes
[15:10] <cjwatson> but I think we're going to need to SRU at least livecd-rootfs and possibly pkgsel to manually arrange to install -lts-quantal
[15:10] <cjwatson> actually I'd rather leave pkgsel alone and only support installing the enablement stack from desktop images ...
[15:10] <cjwatson> (and DVD)
[15:10] <cjwatson> and there's the question of things like the Chinese edition
[15:12] <cjwatson> kind of unfortunate nobody arranged for anyone cdimagey to have a work item for this ...
[15:12] <tjaalton> :)
[15:13] <cjwatson> so, if I can have an xorg reupload with a bug ref, I'll accept that, and then we can get going on the image building changes after the SB changes are in -updates
[15:14] <mlankhorst> ok
[15:14] <mlankhorst> could you look at the video blobs in the meantime?
[15:15] <cjwatson> specific package names?
[15:15] <mlankhorst> nvidia-* and fglrx whatever, that are still in the proposed queue
[15:15] <cjwatson> mkay
[15:18] <mlankhorst> do you want a bug specific about xorg, or just generic 'xorg quantal in precise' bug
[15:19] <cjwatson> the latter's fine
[15:20] <cjwatson> sigh, at least one of these fglrx uploads is busted
[15:20] <cjwatson> is tseliot on IRC anywhere?
[15:20] <mlankhorst> should be
[15:20] <mlankhorst> but not online atm
[15:20] <tjaalton> probably on holiday
[15:24] <cjwatson> in that case perhaps one of you could upload new fglrx-installer-experimental-9 and fglrx-installer-updates packages in line with comments #31 and #32 in bug 1080588 (i.e. drop the xserver-xorg-core deps and upload with appropriate -v)?

[15:33] <mlankhorst> cjwatson: hm should I bump version of xorg as well or can you delete the current one from -proposed?
[15:33] <cjwatson> mlankhorst: I've rejected it
[15:34] <mlankhorst> ah k
[15:36] <tjaalton> cjwatson: so can I reuse 2:9.010-0ubuntu0.2 and squash both changes there?
[15:37] <cjwatson> In this case, since there's an additional change, I'd rather you used a new version number
[15:37] <cjwatson> (actual source change rather than just changelog)
[15:37] <tjaalton> so 0.4?
[15:37] <cjwatson> Yeah

[15:44] <cjwatson> mlankhorst: yes, thanks, now that I've targeted it to precise :)
[15:44] <mlankhorst> ah right
[15:44] <mlankhorst> uploading
[15:46] <mlankhorst> oops
[15:46] <cjwatson> oops?
[15:46] <mlankhorst> raced with your bug changes :)
[15:47] <cjwatson> not a problem ...
[15:47] <mlankhorst> but it's there now, I'm uncertain about the fglrx changes, tjaalton are you working on it?
[15:48] <cjwatson> yeah, I'll review it once the queue gets a debdiff
[15:48] <tjaalton> mlankhorst: yeah, trying to figure out what to actually change :)
[15:49] <mlankhorst> how are those maintained btw?
[15:50] <tjaalton> in git somewhere I think, but pulled them from the rejected queue
[15:50] <tjaalton> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+queue?queue_state=4&queue_text=
[15:50] <mlankhorst> yeah I was just curious if we had a central repo or something, similar to other xorg things
[15:51] <tjaalton> nothing we can touch
[15:51] <tjaalton> it's on github or such
[15:51] <mlankhorst> ah
[16:08] <tjaalton> fglrx-installer-experimental uploaded
[16:08] <tjaalton> -updates after dinner
[16:22] <tjaalton> cjwatson: the nvidia-96 upload you accepted failed to upload (after build) on amd64, should I just kick a rebuild?
[16:24] <cjwatson> sure, if it looks transient
[16:27] <tjaalton> yup, built fine
[16:34] <mlankhorst> ok now xorg should work? :)
[16:34] <tjaalton> hmm, so fglrx-updates in precise doesn't even support the new backport stack, is there any point in updating that version for that bug?
[16:34] <mlankhorst> nah
[16:35] <tjaalton> ok, so it may wait for the other sru to pass
[16:35] <tjaalton> although, it has the same bug as the experimental one
[16:42] <mlankhorst> yay
[16:46] <brendand> anyone know why in 12.04.2 the kernel versions vary between the amd64 and i386 builds?

[16:47] <apw> oh ... are the boot kernels on i386 non-pae i wonder
[16:49] <apw> hmm no, that is a pae kernel on there, so not that
[16:52] <cjwatson> brendand: ara already asked about that on #ubuntu-devel
[16:52] <cjwatson> and yes it probably is something to do with pae
[16:52] <cjwatson> it's on my list
[16:53] <brendand> cjwatson, ok. a fix isn't an emergency from our perspective. mainly we just needed to know whether it was in fact a bug
[16:53] <brendand> cjwatson, we wanted to make sure that 3.5 was the kernel that was supposed to be included
[16:54] <cjwatson> it is a bug and is something I need to fix for .2
[16:55] <tjaalton> cjwatson: both fglrx packages uploaded, but the other sru's still block them
[17:01] <infinity> cjwatson: I'm sure we have a lot more misfeatures to shake out on images, but I can't think of anything else SB-specific that needed testing.  I've been mostly not getting in the way of you, slangasek, and stgraber testing, mind you. :P
[17:10] <cjwatson> infinity: OK.  Do you have any objection if I just promote the lot now, then?

[19:44] <infinity> cjwatson: The patch to debian/* in grub doesn't match the behaviour you patched into grub itself.
[19:45] <infinity> cjwatson: (That is, the debian bits will ignore grub.d if /etc/default/grub doesn't exist, while grub will still use grub.d even if default/grub isn't there)
[19:46] <infinity> cjwatson: Not sure which behaviour is most desirable, but they should probably be consistent.
[19:48] <cjwatson> fair point; I'll fix that later (and in experimental/raring too)
[19:49] <cjwatson> feel free to reject/hold/whatever
