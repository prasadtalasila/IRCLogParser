[04:40] <harriz> hello anybody in here?
[18:21] <ahayzen> Hi can i ask questions relating to GLADE in here? Thanks
[18:37] <qwertzui11> ahayzen: dont ask to ask
[18:37] <ahayzen> qwertzui11, okies
[18:37] <qwertzui11> ;-)
[18:39] <ahayzen> Hi, In GLADE when I add a 'related action' to a button it then becomes disabled in the viewer, even though sensitive is set to True. I'm sure I'm just doing it wrong. Can anyone help? Thanks in advance
[18:53] <stqn> hi
[20:35] <wfire> well hello everyone
[20:36] <wfire> I just found out that the Ubuntu mobile is using QML
[20:36] <wfire> I am super excited to find this out
[20:39] <wfire> I haven't been excited for much in a long time
[20:39] <wfire> I can feel excitement for this
[20:39] <wfire> anyone around?
[20:47] <stqn> yeah, but I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about :)
[20:47] <JanC> wfire: sometimes  ;)
[20:47] <wfire> QML is a language one can use in QTCreator
[20:48] <JanC> stqn: Ubuntu Phone uses QML which is a GUI design language based on Qt
[20:48] <stqn> ok…
[20:48] <wfire> It is my favorite, I am not a programmer by trade, so I taught myself QML
[20:48] <wfire> I don't use the GUI side though
[20:48] <wfire> I type it all out
[20:49] <stqn> I’ve used the GUI editor of Qt Creator, but haven’t seen this QML thing.
[20:49] <JanC> wfire: you can also contribute to Ubuntu Phone then, if you want
[20:49] <wfire> yeah that is what I am hoping to do
[20:49] <wfire> I was a Qt Ambassador when Nokia had Qt
[20:50] <wfire> but then everything fell apart
[20:50] <wfire> I just learned that Ubuntu is using it so I looked up the app dev stuff online and found this channel
[20:50] <wfire> thought I would pop in and say hi
[20:51] <wfire> I will be installing Qt Creator tonight again and start having some fun
[20:52] <wfire> so being new to the Ubuntu phone scene, are there any phones running the OS yet?
[20:54] <JanC> wfire: not released with it
[20:55] <JanC> go to #ubuntu-phone if you want more info
[20:55] <JanC> but AFAIK they use the latest Google Android phone for prototyping
[20:56] <JanC> as it's not locked down
[20:57] <stqn> still no-one with experience on releasing closed-source apps for the USC?
[21:00] <wfire> USC? what is USC?
[21:01] <wfire> well I am going to get an app ready to release as fast as I can then
[21:01] <wfire> latest google android phone huh
[21:01] <stqn> ubuntu software center
[21:01] <wfire> oh
[21:02] <wfire> You will have to excuse me, I am not a big linux user.  in fact I am going to have to install it just to get the Ubuntu Qt-Components
[21:02] <wfire> everything I have is windows
[21:02] <stqn> I’m sorry ;)
[21:03] <wfire> which I can get qt creator but I am not sure how the qt-components would install
[21:03] <wfire> stqn, hahaha
[21:03] <wfire> I don't mind, I never claimed to be awesome at anything
[21:03] <wfire> in my life
[21:03] <wfire> but I would love to keep QML growing
[21:41] <JanC> stqn: there are several closed source apps in USC, so I'm sure some people have experience...  ;)
[21:46] <stqn> yeah, maybe I should contact the developers
[21:47] <stqn> … right now I’m considering installing ubuntu 12.04 64 bit, ubuntu 12.10 64 bit, and using those to build for 64 and 32 bit… Or installing the 32
[21:47] <stqn> oops
[21:47] <stqn> or installing and building only for 32 bit
[21:48] <stqn> I wish it worked under virtualbox, but it doesn’t
[21:49] <stqn> I also tried vmware but it’s even worse (no 3D accel)
[21:49] <wfire> I wish I just knew what was in the ubuntu qt components
[21:50] <wfire> oh well I will start playing around soon
[21:53] <wfire> stqn, so do you run windows as well?
[22:03] <stqn> no, Arch linux and xubuntu 12.04
