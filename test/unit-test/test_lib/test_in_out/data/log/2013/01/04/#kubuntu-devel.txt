[05:34] <jussi> bah, no Rohan... :/
[06:56] <soee> good morning
[08:18] <shadeslayer> ScottK: btw, would this code copy be acceptable in Kubuntu ? https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/network/telepathy/ktp-text-ui/repository/revisions/0cd3262738f93474895d9756f8689c71313ebd65
[08:18] <shadeslayer> comes from KDE PIM 4.10
[08:26] <soee> i must say this refreshed oxygen theme looks awesome :)
[08:26] <soee> yofel_, already starts to build RC2 ?
[08:27] <shadeslayer> yep
[08:27] <shadeslayer> see http://yofel.dyndns.org/kubuntu/build_status_4.9.97_raring.html
[08:27] <shadeslayer> mostly everything is stuck on nepomuk which in turn was stuck on soprano

[08:31] <shadeslayer> I think I can get everything to build in another 2 hours 
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[08:41] <soee> its raring right?
[08:41] <soee> and what about Quantal backports ?
[08:44] <shadeslayer> Once I'm done with raring, I'll upload for quantal :)
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[08:50] <shadeslayer> hopefully builds will get retried automagically

[08:55] <soee> shadeslayer, is there some log where are listed changes/fixes since RC1 ?

[12:38] <shadeslayer> ScottK: there's a usr/bin/pykdeuic4-3.3 and usr/bin/pykdeuic4-2.7 now
[12:38] <shadeslayer> can I put the former in python3-pykde4.install

[12:41] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: I think you should do that :P

[12:41] <yofel_> isn't pykdeuic in -dev right now?
[12:41] <Quintasan> unless there is some multiarch magic going on
[12:41] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: just want to confirm, I have no experience with this package :P
[12:41] <shadeslayer> yofel_: yep
[12:41] <shadeslayer> and now we have 2 binaries
[12:42] <shadeslayer> so should I install both of those via the -dev package>
[12:42] <yofel_> yeah, but then just keep them in -dev, it's just the UI compiler
[12:42] <shadeslayer> I see
[12:42] <yofel_> ScottK will know whether that should be in 2 dev packages
[12:43] <shadeslayer> k
[12:43]  * Riddell looks at kde-baseapps
[12:44] <shadeslayer> needs nepomuk-widgets iirc 
[12:45] <Riddell> which is in, so it might well just work
[12:45] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: TBH if it's in -dev I would just stick it there and pray it wokrs
[12:45] <Quintasan> works*
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
=== Tonio__ is now known as Tonio_aw
[13:49] <ScottK> shadeslayer: Since we have kdepim 4.10, why not wrap all that up in an IFDEF for if pim << 4.10?  That would be the proper solution.
[13:49] <ScottK> I think a code copy to support earlier pim versions is fine as long as it's not used in 4.10.
[13:50] <ScottK> shadeslayer: re pykdeuic and ptyhon3-pykde4,install, yes.
[13:50] <ScottK> Actually, yofel's right.  In the -dev.
[13:55] <BluesKaj> Hey all
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio__
[14:13] <shadeslayer> @_@
[14:13] <shadeslayer> 31.5 seconds of lag
[14:15] <shadeslayer> ScottK: alright, putting it in -dev , though I have an insane amount of lag so it's bettter if someone takes over
[14:15]  * ScottK is doing $work, so can't.
[14:15] <shadeslayer> okay
[14:19] <d_ed_> ScottK: hey, when you're free - ping me about the ktp patch that shadeslayer has been discussing with you
[14:19] <shadeslayer> ScottK: one other thing, in pykde4 we have python3.3.diff which includes PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR2
[14:19] <shadeslayer> is the 2 at the end a typo?
[14:20] <ScottK> shadeslayer: check with xnox.
[14:20] <shadeslayer> xnox: ^
[14:20] <xnox> shadeslayer: no, not a typo.
[14:20] <shadeslayer> okay, thought so
[14:20] <xnox> it's the get_include_dir(plat_specific=1)
[14:21] <xnox> to get the second "multiarch" path where the pyconfig.h is hiding.
[14:21] <shadeslayer> ah
[14:21] <shadeslayer> then I think it's not working
[14:21] <xnox> shadeslayer: and now we also need same thing in python2.7 as well.... since that one is also multiarched.
[14:22] <shadeslayer> I see
[14:22] <xnox> shadeslayer: have you got build logs of it not working?! I can poke it.
[14:22] <shadeslayer> probably why pykde4
[14:22] <shadeslayer> fails
[14:23] <shadeslayer> do you have access to the kubuntu-ninjas team?
[14:23] <xnox> nope, I am not a ninja
[14:24] <shadeslayer> ok,lemme try
[14:25] <shadeslayer> actually, I'll get back to you
[14:32] <shadeslayer> xnox: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1495452/
[14:33] <ScottK> xnox: We may need python-qt4 built with multi-arch python2.7 before pykde4 will build and I haven't figured that one out yet.  I'd appreciate suggestions.
[14:34] <xnox> I see.
[14:34]  * xnox is poking ubiquity atm, I'll poke those next.
[14:43] <seaLne> can anyone running 4.9.5 on precise tell me if they are seeing the "queued for download" icon instead of the "queued for seeding" one in ktorrent? the arrow is pointing down instead of up
[14:44] <shadeslayer> hmm ... probably a ktorrent bug? what version of ktorrent do you have?
[14:44] <shadeslayer> it's fine in 4.2.1
[14:45] <seaLne> 4.2.1 i never noticed this before upgrading to .5 today
[14:46] <seaLne> weird
[14:46] <shadeslayer> weird indeed
[14:46] <shadeslayer> 4.2.1 + 4.9.95 is fine
[14:46] <seaLne> not for me :-/
[14:46] <shadeslayer> open a bug on bugs.kde.org?
[14:47]  * seaLne goes looking for the images used
[14:48] <shadeslayer> seaLne: kiconfinder
[14:50] <shadeslayer> you want go-up and go-down I think
[14:51] <seaLne> no its the queued ones not currently seeding that are the problem
[14:51] <shadeslayer> ahhh
[14:51] <shadeslayer> ah yes

[15:35] <ScottK> d_ed_: pong
[15:36] <d_ed_> ScottK: hey
[15:37] <d_ed_> shadeslayer was passing on some messages between you and him about us copying a file from kdepim.
[15:37] <shadeslayer> https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/network/telepathy/ktp-text-ui/repository/revisions/0cd3262738f93474895d9756f8689c71313ebd65
[15:38] <shadeslayer> the commit being discussed
[15:39] <d_ed_> I don't want to spend any more time on this commit, it's already taken up way more time than this original patch deserves.
[15:40] <d_ed_> and I don't want you guys to waste time on it either. Everything works, everything compiles happily on all KDEs, things are good :)
[15:51] <ScottK> Right.
[15:52] <ScottK> Using the code copy only if kdepim 4.10 is not available doesn't seem like it'd be hard.
[15:52] <ScottK> http://hothardware.com/News/Touchcapable-KDEbased-Plasma-Active-Ported-to-Nexus-7-Tablet/
[15:52] <d_ed_> yes, but then I have to support two code paths, over a single button
[15:53] <shadeslayer> doesn't say what it's running
[15:53] <d_ed_> plus it stops us changing it locally.. plus I then have to expain this to every distro that doesn't have a shadeslayer.
[15:53] <d_ed_> when they all ask if kdepimlibs is needed or not..
[15:54] <shadeslayer> lol
[15:55] <shadeslayer> I wonder why kgpg needs nepomuk
[15:56] <shadeslayer> ah not kgpg
[16:03] <shadeslayer> mck182: btw I setup a cronjob for ktp-contact-list mklaptek/kpeople today

[16:04] <mck182> ah, I need to fix stuff in there!
[16:04] <shadeslayer> now I need to package everything up neatly
[16:04] <shadeslayer> mck182: it runs every 12 hours
[16:05] <mck182> cool, thanks shadeslayer
[16:05] <shadeslayer> 2300 / 1100 UTC
[16:05] <shadeslayer> mck182: I'm going to package it on Sunday
[16:06] <shadeslayer> so get your fixes in :P
[16:06] <mck182> ok
[16:06] <ScottK> d_ed_: The if version test in CMakeLists.txt isn't enough for packagers to figure it out, then they shouldn't be packaging KDE stuff.  It's quite readable.

[16:12] <maco> some of those interesting pronunciations result in sounding an awful lot like an interesting wig
[16:15] <ScottK> xnox: If you get a chance to look at python-qt4, we want the one from experimental with the Ubuntu changes merged, plus whatever it takes to build with python2.7.
[16:18] <xnox> lol, I smell a TIL trap =)
[16:24] <ScottK> xnox: I maintain it in Debian, so no.
[16:24] <ScottK> Once Wheezy's out, I'll make sure it syncs.
[16:27] <shadeslayer> ScottK: do you think we should upload kip-mtp to the archive?
[16:28] <shadeslayer> it's a bit of a hit/miss so far
[16:29]  * shadeslayer is thinking of uploading a new snapshot
[16:32] <ScottK> shadeslayer: Yes.
[16:32] <ScottK> Working for some/not others is better than not available.
[16:32] <shadeslayer> I see
[16:32] <shadeslayer> very well, Update snapshot, test this week, upload next week?
[16:33] <ScottK> Sooner the better, IMO.
[16:34] <ScottK> It's going to hit New, so there'll be time to test.
[16:34] <shadeslayer> hmm okay
[16:34] <shadeslayer> will send you the new snapshot link for uploading
[16:37] <ScottK> shadeslayer: Don't have me upload it.  If I do, I can't do the New.
[16:37] <shadeslayer> oh right
[16:37] <shadeslayer> I'll get Quintasan to do it
[16:38] <Quintasan> Send it my way and I'll find something wrong there :P

[17:30] <yofel> anyone running the backport script yet?
[17:41] <shadeslayer> yofel: I planned on doing it
[17:41] <shadeslayer> but
[17:41] <shadeslayer> please make sure packages are sync'd to bzr first
[17:41] <shadeslayer> I haven't sync'd stuff to bzr just yet
[17:42] <yofel> shadeslayer: the backport script doesn't use bzr
[17:43] <shadeslayer> oh cool
[17:43] <shadeslayer> then please run it :)
[17:43] <shadeslayer> or wait another hour maybe?
[17:43] <yofel> can do, I just backported soprano
[17:43] <shadeslayer> I thought I already ... oh
[17:43] <shadeslayer> I only backported akonadi
[17:43] <shadeslayer> yofel: let's get raring all done
[17:46] <yofel> k, but backport wise the state of raring is fine now. Only symbol changes and pykde4 left
[17:46] <shadeslayer> *nod* but I'd like to finish off raring :P
[17:46] <yofel> sure
[17:47] <yofel> hm, nvm, kdeadmin seems to need nepomukcore
[17:49] <shadeslayer> nooo
[17:49] <shadeslayer> yofel: I don't think it needs nepomukcore
[17:49] <shadeslayer> I saw it in kgpg and korundum as well I think
[17:50] <shadeslayer> ofcourse, I could be wrong, but have a look at KdepimLibsConfig.cmake
[17:50] <yofel> ah, then kdepimlibs5-dev needs to depend on nepomuk-core-dev probably, then the error should be gone
[17:50] <yofel> s/error/warning/
[17:50] <kubotu> yofel meant: "ah, then kdepimlibs5-dev needs to depend on nepomuk-core-dev probably, then the warning should be gone"
[17:50] <shadeslayer> I think that warning is a bit useless tbh :P
[17:52] <yofel> well, yeah. But then upstream shouldn't just expect nepomuk to be there - but if they do it might be a good idea to actually install it
[17:53] <yofel> meh, I'm gone again for a while
[17:53] <shadeslayer> cya
