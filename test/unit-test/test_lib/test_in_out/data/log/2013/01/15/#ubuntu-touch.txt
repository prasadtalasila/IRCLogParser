[13:57] <the_hydra> hi guys
[13:58] <the_hydra> if geistest command doesn't display anything, does that mean that my touchpad 100% can't do multitouch?
[14:16] <bregma> the_hydra, not necessarily
[14:17] <bregma> make sure you specify a windowid, otherwise you maybe getting a fail to grab the root window
[14:17] <bregma> also, run the geisview tool and see what devices it enumerates -- make sure you specify a windowid to avoid the root window grab probelm
[14:18] <the_hydra> bregma: so, I have to choose window other than the root window?
[14:19] <bregma> it guarantees you don;t have a problem grabbing the root window, which you may not be able to do
[14:19] <the_hydra> bregma: btw, I also test my touchpad in Unity (ubuntu 12.10), no gestures are recognized
[14:19] <bregma> I'm a little rusty, I think it's the -w option
[14:20] <the_hydra> bregma: so it's like e.g geistest -w 0xabc ?
[14:20] <bregma> it's possible your touchpad does not recognize more than 2 touches, that's very common
[14:20] <bregma> geistest -w 0xab yes, cut'n'paste the windowid from xwininfo
[14:21] <bregma> 'xinput list' should give you info about the input devices X is seeing, and that should allow you to dig down more as well
[14:21] <the_hydra> bregma: i'll test again when I have another spare time...btw, the recommended installation method AFAIK is by compiling the sorce, right?
[14:21] <bregma> installation of what?
[14:21] <the_hydra> bregma: oh sorry, touchegg
[14:22] <bregma> I believe the packaged version of touchegg in Ubuntu is not as recent as the upstream source in he google code repo
[14:23] <the_hydra> bregma: anyway, what am I suppose to see when geistest does indeed detecting my "touch"?
[14:24] <bregma> geistest should dump a whole lot of event data to stdout for each touch
[14:24] <bregma> geisview does the same, only in a gui
[14:25] <bregma> 'xinput test-xi2' does the same with the raw X11 events
[14:28] <the_hydra> i just re did the geistest, nothing happen
[14:29] <the_hydra> this time, i threw in the window id and the device id (i got it from xinput list-props
[14:33] <the_hydra> and....geisview. from its show device menu, I saw empty text box
[14:34] <the_hydra> does that mean, I am out of luck?
[14:42] <bregma> probably...  what kind of touchpad do you have?
[14:48] <the_hydra> xinput report it as Synaptic PS/2... the laptop itself was bought circa early 2008
[14:52] <the_hydra> btw, thanks for your assistance so far
[14:52] <the_hydra> i'd like to mention, I am currently using Linux Mint 13 KDE
[14:55] <bregma> a Synaptic PS/2 is a semi-multitouch device -- it provides the bounding box of the touches and the number of touches, but that information can not be used to identify individual touches or perform most gestures
[14:56] <bregma> I have one myself
[14:56] <bregma> then again, I have a while stable of other devices, too
[15:18] <the_hydra> bregma: ok so i am out of luck
