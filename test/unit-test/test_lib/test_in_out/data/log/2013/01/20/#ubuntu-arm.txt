[09:19] <purezen> Hey guys..!! I am planning to get the Samsung ARM chromebook to run Ubuntu.. would that be worth doing..??
[09:19] <purezen> Any limitations I might face...?
[10:14] <infinity> purezen: We don't officially (or unofficially) support it, and don't ship a kernel or installer for it, but several people are using it nonetheless.  hrw is a good person to ask about it.
[10:24] <mvt007geek> well...i am downloaded an ubuntu-12.04-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+omap4 .then i used "dd" to write image on sdcard.after that i connected sdcard to pandaboard.my pandaboard has a monitor connected to it.but it seems monitor is not working.so i decided to test pandaboard to make sure it is working well or not and i downloaded "validation" from pandasite.then i used "dd" to wrote validation on pandaboard but it need a serial port to show me the results
[10:36] <mvt007geek> my serial port seems not work
[10:40] <infinity> mvt007geek: How did you write the image?
[10:41] <infinity> mvt007geek: "zcat ubuntu-whatever.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb bs=4M"
[10:41] <mvt007geek>    	 	 	 	 	 	    dd if=ubuntu-12.04-preinstalled-desktop-armel+omap4.img of=/dev/sdb
[10:42] <infinity> Oh, you unzipped it first?  So you have a huge image sitting on your hard drive?
[10:42] <infinity> Also, that paste says armel, not armhf.
[10:43] <infinity> Which is kinda impossible, we had no armel images for 12.04
[10:43] <mvt007geek> infinity: complete name is ubuntu-12.04-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+omap4    this is what i downloaded from site and also did checksum on it
[10:44] <infinity> That's not the complete name.  Does it end in .img or .img.gz?
[10:45] <mvt007geek> yes. .img after zipping///////.img.gz befor zipping
[10:45] <infinity> Alright, there's no reason that shouldn't work, then.  Works here just fine.
[10:46] <infinity> Using the HDMI port closest to the USB (not the other one).
[10:47] <mvt007geek> ok
[10:47] <mvt007geek> i did
[10:47] <mvt007geek> before
[10:47] <infinity> Anyhow, you really should plug something into the serial and have a look.
[10:48] <infinity> Even with our images, the early boot outputs to serial.
[10:48] <infinity> Since uBoot has no idea how to turn on the HDMI.
[10:49] <mvt007geek> which one i use? minicom?kermit? or picocom
[10:49] <mvt007geek> ?
[10:49] <infinity> I use screen.
[10:50] <infinity> screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
[10:50] <mvt007geek> right now i installed it.
[10:50] <mvt007geek> and..
[10:52] <mvt007geek> i use a usb to serial cable.one head connected to pc number1 another head to pc number2
[10:52] <mvt007geek> infinity: screen is installed in pc1
[10:52] <infinity> So do I.  Hence why I said /dev/ttyUSB0
[10:53] <mvt007geek> what command i should use for screen?
[10:53] <mvt007geek> i am so strange to screen
[10:54] <infinity> "screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200"
[10:54] <infinity> I feel like I might be repeating myself.
[10:55] <mvt007geek> well.i did that command.what is next step?
[10:56] <infinity> Plug in your Panda's power? :P
[10:57] <mvt007geek> now serial port is into pc number2 as i told.shoud i plug it out?
[10:57] <infinity> Err.  I assumed "pc2" was your Panda...
[10:57] <infinity> Which would sort of make some sense if you intend to talk to the Panda via serial.
[10:59] <mvt007geek> no problem i will connect it to panda :)
[11:05] <mvt007geek> i did this.what is next step
[11:06] <mvt007geek> infinity:
[11:07] <infinity> ...
[11:08] <mvt007geek> infinity: screen shows me nothing.
[11:08] <mvt007geek> only white page
[11:08] <infinity> What did it say when you ran it?
[11:08] <mvt007geek> screen??
[11:08] <mvt007geek> screen told nothing
[11:08] <infinity> Just an empty screen with a blinking cursor?
[11:09] <infinity> If so, that's fine.
[11:09] <infinity> So, make sure the SD card is in your Panda, pull the power, and plug the power back in.
[11:09] <infinity> You should seem some uBoot output.  And it loading a kernel.
[11:09] <infinity> Etc.
[11:10] <mvt007geek> still nothing :(
[11:10] <infinity> Jigge the card, reseat it, power-cycle again.
[11:11] <infinity> If it doesn't even see uBoot, you've either written the image wrong or your card is bad, or your Panda is broken.
[11:12] <mvt007geek> no.it shows nothing. let's try pcnumber2
[11:12] <mvt007geek> should i reboot that pc again?
[11:12] <infinity> Erm.
[11:12] <infinity> The Pandaboard, nor your PC.
[11:12] <infinity> s/nor/not/
[11:13] <mvt007geek> what?
[11:14] <mvt007geek> infinity: u mean i don't connect pc2 to pc1?
[11:25] <purezen> infinity: Hey..!! thanks there..:) ok.. I particularly needed some headers to get it working and its current state..
[11:25] <infinity> purezen: I'm not much help, since I don't own one and have thus not been paying attention but, like I said, hrw might be of help.
[11:26] <infinity> Or his blog may have pointers, if you dig.
[11:26] <infinity> http://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/
[11:27] <purezen> infinity: well.. thanks for that.. and right right now he doesnt look available.. shall I pm him..?
[11:28] <infinity> purezen: I'm not his secretary, I can't say.  But sure, go nuts. :P
[11:28] <infinity> (Do read the Chromebook entries in his blog, though, he may answer some of your questions there)
[11:29] <kulve> how do you set the IP for usb0 for nexus7 with g_multi?
[11:29] <kulve> I might copy the same logic for my rootfs
[11:31] <purezen> infinity: ok.. :D :D .. will do that.. thanks again..:)
[12:01] <wookey> xnox: I tried using dh_autoreconf but it doesn't seem to work. just do "dh  $@  --with-autoreconf", right? Doesn;t work for json-c for me
[12:02] <wookey> http://people.linaro.org/~wookey/buildd/raring-arm64/json-c_0.10-1.2-raring-arm64-20130120-1050.log
[12:02] <wookey> what am I doing wrong?
[12:04] <infinity> wookey: "--with autoreconf"
[12:04] <infinity> wookey: No dash.
[12:07] <infinity> wookey: "--wish-autoreconf" isn't a dh(1) option, so it'll just pass it down to all the sub-dh modules (as you see it doing).
[12:08] <infinity> wookey: "--with foo,bar,baz", however, means "include dh_foo, dh_bar, and dh_baz in the list of fancy things you do"
[12:08] <infinity> s/wish/with/
[12:09] <wookey> aha. cheers
[12:09] <wookey> doh
[13:21] <mvt007geek> what is the best way to write an arm image (ubuntu) into sdcard?
[13:22] <mvt007geek> i used dd but serial port doesn't show it and it don't boot when i put sdcard in pandaboard. is there a good software to do that?
[14:20] <cobalt60> mvt007geek welcome to the wonderful world of Linux on ARM
[14:22] <robclark> rsalveti (or anyone), I don't suppose there is a working gnome-shell somewhere for 12.10?  http://pastie.org/pastes/5735819/text
[14:48] <Rjs> kulve: my solution to setting the IP is to have something like this in /etc/network/interfaces: auto usb0\niface usb0 inet static\n  address 10.1.2.3\n  netmask 255.255.255.0
[14:49] <Rjs> (possibly also set gateway 10.1.2.1 if you want a default route through it - I mostly just use a http proxy on the same 10.1.2.x network so a default route is not needed)
[14:52] <Rjs> and I have something similar on the computer(s) that I connect the nexus7 to: iface usb0 inet static\n  address 10.1.2.1\n  netmask 255.255.255.0
[14:54] <kulve> Rjs: thanks but my rootfs (Mer based) doesn't parse /etc/network/interfaces. I'm looking for e.g. udev rules that run a script when usb0 emerges
[14:56] <lilstevie> kulve: you should probably ask Mer support
[14:58] <Rjs> kulve: hmm, at least for me the interface seems to exist all the time after the gadget driver is loaded, regardless of whether the usb port is connected to something not - so maybe you might as well run the script just once after the driver is loaded
[15:00] <Rjs> (as long as you don't set a default gateway, it shouldn't be a problem that the extra interface is up even though it isn't connected to anything - except that the IP network you configure for it it should be private enough that it doesn't clash with anything you use elsewhere)
[15:01] <Rjs> at least I haven't had any problems with this kind of setup on my openmoko gta02 (whose g_ether gadget driver also behaves like that)...
[15:02] <kulve> basically I need to make sure that the script that loads the g_multi is run before the script that sets up the IP. That's why an udev based thing would have been nice
[15:03] <kulve> but nm, I'm sure I'll find something from the google :)
[15:09] <Rjs> ok :) I've not done much with udev so I'm not quite sure how it works... from a quick glance, I think that debian stable (which I happen to be using now) has a rule in /lib/udev/rules.d/80-drivers.rules to run /lib/udev/net.agent which is a shell script that runs ifup or ifdown as necessary
[15:09] <Rjs> maybe Mer has something similar, I don't know...
[15:09] <kulve> maybe this could work: "KERNEL=="usb0", ACTION=="add", RUN+="ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.15 up"
[15:09] <kulve> bbl
[16:12] <_Takashi_> Hi, just flash the latest raring on a nexus7, the screen isnt't drawn correctely at all and it's stuck at system config, does anyone else had the same problem. Thanks in advance .
[17:33] <magart> Anyone here using Ubuntu on their Nexus 7?
[17:34] <Tassadar> magart: I think you can presume that at least one of 146 people on this channel does
[17:34] <Tassadar> :)
[17:36] <magart> ;)) I'm looking for a way to solve the touch problem. Basically whatever you touch, the OS then sticks to it so you can't switch between windows or click some buttons.
[17:37] <magart> Also it would be nice to know if there's a place where a changelog is kept so I know what was changed each day (because there is a new image every day).
[17:38] <Tassadar> well, the thing with touch is known and reported bug in X - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-nexus7/+bug/1068994
[17:38] <ubot2> Ubuntu bug 1068994 in ubuntu-nexus7 "button1 gets stuck after a while" [Critical,Confirmed]
[17:56] <magart> how can you enable meatcity on Nexus 7?
[17:56] <magart> I meant metacity* :)
[18:50] <cobalt60> Metacity?  How about IceWM-Lite?
[18:51] <cobalt60> or OpenBox if you prefer GUI config tools
[19:02] <magart> Yea...whatever. How do you enable them?
[19:02] <Tassadar> just install them like on normal desktop ubuntu I would guess
[19:13] <robclark> anyone know what package /usr/bin/jockey-gtk is in?  dpkg-query -L jocky-gtk only lists /usr/share/doc/... for me
[19:14] <robclark> (not sure if that is anything to do with why gnome-session --session=ubuntu doesn't work for me.. but that is one thing it complains about.. fwiw compiz itself does work)
[19:37] <robclark> oh, hm. nm, I think I see the issue..
