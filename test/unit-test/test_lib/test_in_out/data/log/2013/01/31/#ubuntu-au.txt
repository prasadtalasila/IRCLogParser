[06:36] <graemeW> Hey all, anything interesting happening?
[11:29] <ikt> hi all :)
[12:22] <ikt>  /poke
[12:28] <ikt> hey sagaci 
[12:29] <sagaci> hi ikt 
[12:52] <ikt> sagaci: we gotta get some more aussies somehow
[12:53] <ikt> they're definitly around
[12:53] <ikt> There's like 2 aussies on the moderator team
[12:53] <ikt> I just can't think of how to get us all together
[12:54] <ikt> aren't most people on google plus?
[13:04] <sagaci> I only listen on g+
[13:08] <ikt> that should be enough
[13:08] <ikt> surely there must be 10's maybe even hundreds of australian ubuntu users on g+?
[13:09] <ikt> we just need to funnel them towards some projects
[13:09] <ikt> I suppose we should have some projects first
[20:59] <head_victim> ikt: I think the main issue is that for the majority, they are only users. Ubuntu has migrated from niche enthusiasts to reasonably common (as much as a Linux desktop can) so getting people enthused about doing stuff is difficult. 
[20:59] <head_victim> So more than just trying to let them know we exist, we need to work out how we can motivate people to be involved :)
[22:52] <ikt> agreed head_victim 
[22:53] <ikt> off to work I go
