[00:48] <pomare> Hey
[00:48]  * Ubik blames cyberanger 
[00:49] <pomare> My grandfather passed away couple of months ago.
[00:49] <pomare> Was cleaning his house and I ran into something pretty unique
[00:49] <Ubik> sorry to hear that... what did ya run across?
[00:50] <pomare> http://i.imgur.com/wWk4Y.jpg
[00:50] <pomare> it appears to be elvis' signed draft card
[00:53] <pomare> http://i.imgur.com/IID1a.jpg
[00:53] <pomare> thats the back of it
[00:54] <Ubik> nice
[00:54] <pomare> it says that "the law requires you to have this certificate in your personal possession at all times"
[00:55] <pomare> which means it wasnt something he got rid of
[00:55] <Ubik> right
[00:55] <pomare> yeah
[00:55] <pomare> it is nice
[01:04] <wrst> hello pomare , Ubik

[03:38] <pomare> http://postimage.org/gallery/9cojuye0/
[03:38] <pomare> some images of what we've found
[03:39] <pomare> still hundreds of crates unopened.
[03:40] <linuxman410> cool stuff
[03:40] <pomare> yea :)
[03:40] <pomare> its incredible
[17:27] <linuxman410> anyone here
[17:29] <wrst> linuxman410: i'm here
[17:29] <wrst> going to get lunch so i'm in and out for a few
[17:29] <linuxman410> how u doing
[17:30] <wrst> good  you?
[17:31] <linuxman410> ok i guess
[17:31] <wrst> on my way to some unhealthy fast food
[17:32] <linuxman410> oh yeah
[17:33] <wrst> artery clogging goodness
[17:34] <linuxman410> yep
[17:34] <wrst> what are you up to today linuxman410 ?
[17:35] <average_guy> I am here to setting up irssi and centerim.  How are you fine gentlemen doing today?
[17:36] <linuxman410> went and got application almost sold everything i have and have no money now
[17:37] <wrst> :(
[17:37] <wrst> average_guy: I'm doing good
[17:38] <linuxman410> i do not really want to sell my netbook cause its about the only thing i have left
[17:38] <average_guy> glad to hear that wrst, enjoy your lunch
[17:38] <wrst> hopefully that won't happen
[17:39] <linuxman410> hope not
[17:39] <wrst> just ordered a whopper average_guy
[17:40]  * wrst waits in the drive thru
[17:40] <average_guy> mmmm, those are my fav
[17:40] <wrst> I like them too much
[17:40] <wrst> average_guy: I know irssi
[17:40] <wrst> what is centering?
[17:40] <wrst> hmm
[17:41] <wrst> centerim?
[17:41] <wrst> silly phone
[17:41] <average_guy> it is an ncurses instant messenger
[17:42] <wrst> ahh OK
[17:42] <average_guy> I don't know crap about irssi wrst, trying to figure the config out
[17:42] <wrst> I have been using bitlbee
[17:43] <average_guy> I have heard you talk about it before.  This is my first foray into GUI-less linux
[17:44] <average_guy> I have an Ubuntu server (giving me a headache) and I'm ssh'd into it from a win box at the momment
[17:50]  * wrst arrives at a keyboard
[17:50] <wrst> oh average_guy don't think I'm gui-less, i use bitlebee with quassel
[17:51] <wrst> the backend on a server without a gui but i'm happily pointing and clicking :)
[17:51] <wrst> and average_guy Unit193 is an ace at irssi
[17:51]  * wrst loves highlighting people just to wake them up
[17:56] <average_guy> It is nice to know there are people here with answers wrst,  that is why I lurk here ;)
[17:57] <wrst> yeah i lurk all the time just never have answers :)
[17:57] <average_guy> I'm trying to exaust google before I start buggin you guys though
[17:57] <wrst> what are you trying to do average_guy?
[17:58] <average_guy> well for starters I connect to Freenode and OFTC on startup and I would like to see them in seperate windows
[17:59] <wrst> you are already over my head :) oh Unit193????
[18:04] <average_guy> trying to figure out how to automate OFTC identification, got it to work for freenode, so I'm getting close
[18:06] <wrst> seems like there are several different ways to all accomplish the same thing?
[18:07] <average_guy> what do you mean wrst?
[18:07] <wrst> just remember lots of guides all a little different but doing the same thing
[18:08] <wrst> i haven't attempted irssi in a couple of years
[18:08] <average_guy> aw man, it is staggering how much info and scripts are available
[18:10] <wrst> yeah i just wanted to chat, irssi wants to run the world :)
[18:23] <Unit193> average_guy: So how did you setup auth to Freenode?
[18:26] <wrst> greetings Unit193
[18:26] <Unit193> Howdy wrst.
[18:26] <wrst> Unit193: hope all is going well
[18:27] <wrst> oh Unit193 ordered the network gear
[18:28] <average_guy> I followed the steps here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1010780 Unit193 and then tried to duplicate with OFTC
[18:28] <Unit193> wrst: I hope so too, and great!  When do you think it'll come in? http://xkcd.com/281/
[18:29] <wrst> Unit193: hopefully by end of week i still need a WAP
[18:29] <wrst> Unit193: love that cartoon :)
[18:29] <average_guy> I connect to both automaticly right now but I hve to manually identify on OFTC still Unit193
[18:29] <Unit193> average_guy: Heh, you could use http://pthree.org/2010/02/01/oftc-ssl-nickserv-and-irssi/  :P
[18:30] <Unit193> average_guy: Normally you can use server password too, for Freenode the server pass would be user:pass
[18:30] <average_guy> wow, that was quick.  awesome
[18:30] <wrst> and Unit193 when i order from newegg it starts in memphis :)
[18:31] <Unit193> But then has to go to TX, then somewhere else. ;)
[18:31] <Unit193> average_guy: ...I may be an odd one, I have SASL setup, server password setup, and certfp too. :P
[18:32] <Unit193> (I wanted one addition to SASL as it failed a couple times)
[18:36] <wrst> Unit193: memphis, nashville, me is how it works unless its through the stupid eggsaver
[18:37] <wrst> then it goes memphis, louisville, usually somewhere close to the ocean then back across to me
[18:48] <wrst> http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/hands-on-with-ubuntu-for-smartphones-2013018/
[19:10] <average_guy> that was outstanding. Thank you Unit193
[19:10] <Unit193> Sure thing, average_guy!
[19:10] <Unit193> Glad to help.
[19:13] <cyberanger> wrst: that's due to Fedex being our fufillment center for most of their tech stuff (and also why the xkcd joke works so well, fedex's largest presence & office is at that airport)
[19:13] <wrst> cyberanger: thankfully with newegg i generally get it shipped ups
[19:14] <cyberanger> I think I get fedex unless I bump up the shipping date
[19:14] <cyberanger> and todays order I did
[19:15] <linuxman410> cyberanger how r u
[19:17] <wrst> cyberanger: yeah if its 2-3 day shipping i usually get ups and its the next day, the cheaper stuff sometimes comes fedex
[19:18] <wrst> sometimes usps and sometimes... DHL!!!
[19:18] <wrst> i dread DHL tracking numbers
[19:18] <cyberanger> linuxman410: good, you?
[19:18] <cyberanger> wrst: 1 day for this
[19:18] <linuxman410> soso
[19:19] <wrst> cyberanger: if its in memphis i get it in one day without anything special if i order in the morning
[19:19] <cyberanger> linuxman410: so, better than last time if I recall
[19:20] <cyberanger> wrst: this order is important & big enough to ignore the cost & have them offically do it for 1 day
[19:20] <linuxman410> cyberanger no not really
[19:20] <cyberanger> linuxman410: hope if gets better
[19:20] <wrst> gotcha rush processing and everything!
[19:20] <wrst> i never have anything that important, well i have at work once or twice
[19:20] <linuxman410> house foreclosed vechicles repoed
[19:21] <cyberanger> wrst: 1/3rd me, 1/3rd my IT contracts, 1/3rd Chattacon, and Amazon will need one of those hard drives soon to load my data
[19:22] <cyberanger> linuxman410: sorry to hear
[19:22] <wrst> cyberanger: amazon will load data on a HDD for you?
[19:24] <cyberanger> http://aws.amazon.com/importexport/ http://awsimportexport.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-import-export-calculator.html
[19:24] <cyberanger> wrst: ^ yes
[19:24] <wrst> cool
[19:24] <wrst> on huge downloads that is awesome, of course that is what you have been doing
[19:25] <cyberanger> yeah, thought you knew when I said import export service
[19:26] <wrst> well i assumed but didn't know for sure
[19:26] <cyberanger> using amazon's ec2's with extra EBS storage, then taking a snapshot, which gets stored in s3 (cheaper and easier for the next step)
[19:27] <wrst> that is a sweet deal
[19:27] <wrst> then when you get the data i'm guessing you just rsync? to keep things current?
[19:28] <cyberanger> they'll do an export when they get my drive, export those snapshots, then here I'll either dd them (they're raw formatted partitions) or more likely I'll convert them to VirtualBox's format (VBox has that in a cli tool)
[19:28] <cyberanger> and yeah, easier to maintain with rsync here, compared to fetching TB's here outright
[19:28] <wrst> oh cool... that's super sweet
[19:29] <wrst> so you can get a system that you really like on AWS send them a drive then have it local... wow
[19:29] <cyberanger> and if I wanted to, I can mail that drive back to amazon, import it, and rsync it there if I had to
[19:29] <wrst> cool/geek factor is very high on that
[19:30] <cyberanger> however, a system image like ubuntu's is so small, that I'd more likely upload it
[19:30] <cyberanger> but that's with next to nothing on it
[19:31] <cyberanger> there's a certain threshold where it's cost effective, I'm spending two months internet just so they touch the drive
[19:31] <cyberanger> that's why I had to wait till I had most of everything ready to go
[19:31] <cyberanger> or I'd be wasting the effort
[19:32] <wrst> that is neat
[19:32] <wrst> and to think i have been transferring about 200GB just across a room since saturday night and it isn't finished yet
[19:33] <cyberanger> (I let it get a little too close to chattacon, but chattacon was the deadline to try it, and I may have to restart later, but it won't be from scratch at least)
[19:33] <cyberanger> really, yeah, you do need the upgrade then
[19:33] <cyberanger> or a seperate network for oversized transfers
[19:34] <wrst> cyberanger: equipment is old, and this is going over wireless on a box i have just for backing up to
[19:34] <wrst> but it needs to be connected via wires
[19:35] <wrst> i am considering running cat 6 wire under the house but i really don't want to
[19:35] <cyberanger> 3 days, 1.1TB, but I think I've moved more than that, and that's some start & stop, and I think 3 days might be more like 49-51 hours, not 72 yet
[19:35] <cyberanger> well, I'd either do that or through the walls, or over the house
[19:36]  * cyberanger loves the cables too much, but my uplink is nowhere near that yet
[19:36] <wrst> yeah cyberanger i have blank plates in every room that is just asking for it
[19:37] <wrst> that may be a spring project, at my tv especially
[19:38] <cyberanger> and it looks like the export is 160, and I'm not sure what the ec2 will be
[19:38] <cyberanger> kinda hoping for 200 or less but at this point, idk
[19:39] <cyberanger> I wouldn't go through this trouble without having an idea of how it'd pay out
[19:40] <cyberanger> I found a company that thinks it could help their internal devolpment, had them agree to split the cost, if I did the work of getting it running
[19:40] <wrst> nice cyberanger
[19:40] <wrst> hope that works out
[19:41] <wrst> sounds like you have a plan
[19:41] <cyberanger> once it was running there, it'd be their cost for bandwidth, my cost for here
[19:42] <cyberanger> and honestly, after three jobs over thanksgiving & christmas, I'm willing to take on one risky & costly project for my resume
[19:42] <cyberanger> and this qualifies, possibly including foolhardy too
[19:44] <linuxman410> cyberanger i am trying to hangon to netbook all i have
[19:46] <cyberanger> linuxman410: woah, that's a big change
[19:47] <linuxman410> cyberanger yeah i know i took all desktops to crusher and laptops
[19:48] <linuxman410> my netbook battery is dead
[20:26] <average_guy> so how about the program mutt? What do you think guys, hot or not?
[20:27] <average_guy> on a mission for an cli email client now
[20:28] <wrst> average_guy: did your video card die? :)
[20:29] <average_guy> lol no, I have a rack of servers here I am playing with
[20:29] <average_guy> trying to bone up on my linux-fu
[20:30] <wrst> :)
[20:30] <wrst> ahh
[20:31] <cyberanger> average_guy: I like it
[20:31]  * wrst rolls eyes at cyberanger
[20:31] <wrst> of course you would cyberanger
[20:31] <average_guy> cool cyberanger, I've been reading about it and it seems to be popular at least
[20:32] <Unit193> I'm a alpine person myself. :P
[20:32] <average_guy> hmmm, Alpine you say
[20:33] <cyberanger> wrst: three to one, cli mail clients rock
