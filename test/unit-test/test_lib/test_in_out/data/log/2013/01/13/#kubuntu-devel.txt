[00:20] <ronnoc> what a PITA though, really
[00:23] <BarkingFish> anyone happen to have the source code to libkscreen, or know where i can find it?
[00:24] <BarkingFish> it's been a while since i dabbled, and i haven't even begun to touch raring
[00:27] <yofel_> BarkingFish: http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=libkscreen.git
[00:27] <BarkingFish> thanks :)
[00:28] <BarkingFish> and it's Dan's commit which has buggered things up?
[00:46] <BarkingFish> *buggered up is such a strong term, apologies.  I can't see where it's gone wrong, to be honest.

[13:06] <BluesKaj> howdy all
[14:19] <allee> hi, what's wrong with dput ppa:kubuntu-ppa/experimental (lilb)kscreen ... .changes?
[14:19] <allee> uploaded yesterday qjson like that but can't see it in the experimental ppa
[14:20] <yofel_> did launchpad send an acceptance mail?
[14:28] <allee> yofel_: no.  I received no mail 
[14:29] <yofel_> did you use the right key to sign the files?
[14:29] <yofel_> if LP sends no mail it usually doesn't recognise the signature
[14:30] <yofel_> (you should get the mail within 10 minutes after upload)
[14:30] <allee> yofel_: mhmm, sig should be right.  I recheck.
[14:30] <yofel_> then try uploading again, maybe something broke
[14:31] <allee> I've tried to move qjson from ppa -> experimental but experimental was no listed as an target ppa :-(
[14:31] <allee> yofel_: I'll try tonight.  Have to leave
[14:31] <allee> yofel_: thx for the info!!!

[14:42] <shadeslayer> ^ Some of the packages are Kubuntu packages
[14:50] <yofel_> shadeslayer: does red mean "failed" or "not rebuilt" ?
[14:51] <yofel_> k3b is red, but it didn't fail
[14:52] <yofel_> *sigh*
[14:53] <yofel_> it would really nice if people would implement packageset-filtering in a few places...
[14:53] <yofel_> (start with errors.ubuntu.com)

[15:40] <shadeslayer> yofel: I don't know :S
[15:40] <shadeslayer> though
[15:40] <shadeslayer> https://launchpad.net/~motumedia/+archive/libav9-raring/+packages
[15:40] <shadeslayer> k3b did fail
[15:40] <shadeslayer> but they're doing test builds in that ppa
[15:41] <yofel> then they should please link to the builds in that...
[15:43] <shadeslayer> dunno what they're doing
[15:43] <shadeslayer> that team has been deprecated
[15:44] <yofel> ...
[15:45] <shadeslayer> so that means you can't join the team and fix
[15:45] <shadeslayer> hooray
[15:46] <shadeslayer> ScottK: could you pass transmission from {quantal,precise}-proposed ?
[15:46] <shadeslayer> er
[15:46] <shadeslayer> I mean from the unaccepted queue into -proposed

[16:10] <yofel> how the hell does ubuntu manage to use more memory than KDE o.O
[16:15] <Riddell> now now, have more faith in your favourite desktop :)
[16:16] <shadeslayer> yofel: actually, I find KDE uses very little memory when constrained
[16:16] <shadeslayer> I could run it on a RasPi and it consumed very little memory
[16:17] <yofel> I didn't mean that KDE hasn't improved there, but 500M sounds a bit excessive for Ubuntu compared to the gnome2 days that I remember
[16:17] <shadeslayer> :D
[16:17] <yofel> ok, ~400-450. but still
[16:20] <Riddell> they did make their own widget toolkit, that's not likely to end up with high memory efficiency, look at star/open/libreoffice.  they should have stuck with unity 2d
[16:40]  * yofel finds it kind of funny how unity and gnome3 have made Xfce popular
[16:41] <shadeslayer> hahaha
[17:27] <shadeslayer> so. very. sleepy
[17:29] <Riddell> well it is late where you are, maybe your body clock is actually on local time?
[17:31] <shadeslayer> somehow I doubt that
[17:32] <shadeslayer> I got up at 1 PM @_@
[19:02] <allee>   Riddel:  I'm not a member of kubuntu-ppa team .   So I can't upload (lib)kscreen to experimental
[19:03] <allee> ^^ anyone with upload right to experimental care to upload (lib)kscreen builds?   They are in kubuntu-packages bzr
[19:07] <allee> ^^ I first try in my ppa if everything is building .. I ping later ...
[19:08] <yofel_> allee: I'll upload it
[19:08] <yofel_> HEAD^ builds
[19:08] <allee> I know I've tested an hour ago.  But I've never verified the build deps in a pbuilder yet ...
[19:14] <yofel_> allee: uploaded, but please fix:
[19:14] <yofel_> W: libkscreen source: debhelper-but-no-misc-depends libkscreen-dev
[19:14] <yofel_> W: libkscreen source: dh-make-template-in-source debian/shlibs.local.ex
[19:14] <yofel_> W: libkscreen source: dh-make-template-in-source debian/watch.ex
[19:14] <yofel_> uploaded for raring and quantal btw.
[19:15] <allee> yofel_:  Thx.  I know about the W them,  Riddell and afiestas suggeted to upload as soon as possible.
[19:16] <allee> yofel_: Is there a tool to get started with the copyright file?
[19:16] <yofel_> not that I know of, shadeslayer dug something out a while ago I think but I do them by hand
[19:16] <allee> yofel_: watch.ex is a reminder I've to keep until there's a proper 1st release
[19:16] <yofel_> using licensecheck + grep
[19:16] <shadeslayer> ah
[19:16] <yofel_> ah ok
[19:17] <shadeslayer> http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/modax/copyright-helper.git;a=summary
[19:17] <shadeslayer> I don't remember the invocation though
[19:18] <shadeslayer> ./something -s
[19:18] <shadeslayer> or something like that
[19:18] <shadeslayer> and libkscreen should be small enough that you can use licensecheck + grep
[19:18] <yofel_> seems like gpl2+ with a few exceptions
[19:19] <shadeslayer> ./copyright-helper.pl -sc
[19:19] <shadeslayer> that should work
[19:20] <allee> shadeslayer, yofel_: thx for the tips.

[19:28] <ScottK> shadeslayer: No time today.  Ping me tomorrow if someone else didn't already.
[19:28] <shadeslayer> sure
[19:36] <Sime> so, who is going to FOSDEM in a few weeks? and is there any clustering around a given hotel going on?
[19:54] <Riddell> ooh it's a Sime 
[19:54] <Sime> hi
[19:54] <Riddell> Sime: yeah book through the FSFE http://www.woodshed.de/tmp/hotel-fosdem.html
[19:54] <Riddell> I'm there friday to monday
[19:55] <Riddell> pst everyone, get your pykde questions in quick while Sime is here :)
[19:55] <Sime> next session is in 2 years time!
[19:55] <Sime> hey, that is hotel Astrid. I was looking at booking there anyway...
[19:57] <Riddell> sit back and relax and let the FSFe do it for you then
[20:01] <Sime> done.
[20:02] <Sime> cool. I didn't see many FOSS people last year.
[20:02] <Sime> i'm looking forward to FOSDEM though!
[20:17] <Riddell> Sime: make sure you come to delerium, that's where it all starts
[20:17] <Sime> Riddell: yeah, I'll probably show up in the evening and then head as per standard procedure. :-)
[20:23] <Riddell> Jesus phoned me again, this time her mum who has a couple words of English, she says she wants to "help kubuntu" so I said use internet relay chat but I suspect she won't turn up
