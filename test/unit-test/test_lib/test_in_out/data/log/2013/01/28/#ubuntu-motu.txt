[00:44] <ESphynx> well I got 2/4 'major' commits done.
[05:46] <ESphynx> so would  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecere-sdk/+filebug  be the proper place where to file each of these bugs that this SRU will target?
[05:46] <micahg> yes
[05:48] <ESphynx> So I got the 4 crucial bugs cherry-picked.
[05:48] <ESphynx> I just need to see how many of the 40 others I want to get done :S
[05:49] <ESphynx> I got 13 marked in red already :|
[06:05] <ESphynx> now I'm going to be fixing the debian packaging as well in a separate branch... Should I add a new changelog entry?
[06:06] <ESphynx> I see this https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePreparation#Update_the_packaging for versioning scheme
[06:08] <micahg> yes
[07:27] <TheLordOfTime> why's mysql-workbench 'main' and not 'universe' or otherwise?  if you know...
[07:39] <dholbach> good morning
[07:39] <TheLordOfTime> hi there :P
[07:44] <mitya57> TheLordOfTime: mysql-workbench: 500 http://ru.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring/**universe** i386 Packages
[07:44] <mitya57> guten morgen dholbach!
[07:45] <dholbach> привет mitya57 :)
[07:47] <mitya57> dholbach: we've been doing some u-p-g fixes yesterday (but for some reason the website is stuck on r255)
[07:49] <TheLordOfTime> mitya57, why does apt-cache show otherwise?
[07:49] <TheLordOfTime> o.O
[07:49]  * TheLordOfTime checks apt-cache
[07:49]  * TheLordOfTime facedesks
[07:50] <dholbach> mitya57, let me check
[07:53] <TheLordOfTime> note to self: don't try and ask questions at 3AM :/
[08:00] <dholbach> mitya57, the file on disk on the server has r265 which is in line with what's in the ppa
[08:00] <dholbach> mitya57, some of the content on dev.u.c is going through a cache, so maybe it's a caching issue? *shrug*
[08:01] <mitya57> $ wget http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/index.html -qO- | grep '~bzr'
[08:01] <mitya57>         VERSION:     '0.3.1~bzr255~quantal1',
[08:01] <mitya57>       Version: 0.3.1~bzr255~quantal1.
[08:01] <dholbach> yes
[08:01] <mitya57> 255 != 265
[08:01] <dholbach> I realise that
[08:02] <mitya57> ah, do you mean server-side cache?
[08:02] <dholbach> yes
[08:02] <mitya57> o
[08:02] <mitya57> *ok
[08:02] <dholbach> I'll ask the IS folks
[08:02] <dholbach> thanks a lot for your work on this
[08:03] <dholbach> mitya57, ru.po is at 64% so getting very close :-)
[08:04] <mitya57> dholbach: I've sent a call for translations to ubuntu-l10n-ru@lists.u.c, but *only one* new string got translated after that :(
[08:04] <mitya57> and as usual I have not time to do that myself :(
[08:04] <dholbach> sure, I understand
[08:04] <dholbach> we'll see how it goes :)
[08:06] <mitya57> maybe more translators will get an e-mail if I file a bug and assign ~launchpad-l10n-ru there, but this sounds a bit agressive to me
[08:07] <dholbach> I'm sure we'll get there :)

[10:38] <bobweaver> Hello there I am trying to make a daily build recipe on launchpad and It keeps on failing but does not fail at all when I run local
[10:39] <bobweaver> it is saying that bzr is not loged in

[10:41] <bobweaver> recipe is http://paste.ubuntu.com/1580322/
[10:41] <bobweaver> thanks for taking some time to look at this for me
[10:47] <mitya57> bobweaver: looks like not your fault, try to ask on #launchpad

[10:57] <ESphynx> Which format should I use for bug patches on LP?
[10:57] <ESphynx> And my multiple-bug SRU should still be split up in multiple patches, right? (one for each bug, but I can point to all the bug in the same SRU? Should one of the bugs 'be' the SRU?)
[11:00] <vibhav> ESphynx: For the multiple-bug SRU. Yes, we can remove those patches in case of a new upstream release is bought into the Ubuntu repositories
[11:01] <vibhav> ESphynx: We will know which patch to remove and which (distribution-specific) patch to kepp :)
[11:05] <ESphynx> well all of these patches are Quantal specific
[11:06] <vibhav> ESphynx: hmm, it will still be safe to keep them different
[11:07] <vibhav> ESphynx: Because a new version can also be backported
[11:14] <ESphynx> hmm would a bazar branch work?
[11:14] <ESphynx> i.e. a specific revision?
=== al-maisan is now known as almaisan-away
[13:30] <ESphynx> there :| 14 bug reports filed .... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecere-sdk
[13:30] <ESphynx> I will try to improve on these tomorrow... Could they all please be targeted to Quantal?
[13:35] <ESphynx> what should I put the status of these SRU bugs to? Fix Committed?
[13:36] <Laney> ESphynx: For SRUs, In Progress = uploaded waiting review, Fix Committed = in -proposed, Fix Released = in -updates
[13:37] <ESphynx> So In Progress then? :) (that's what I've been setting them to)
[13:37] <ESphynx> thanks
[13:37] <Laney> if someone has uploaded them
[13:37] <ESphynx> I'm linking to the bzr revision
[13:37] <Laney> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal/+queue?queue_state=1&queue_text=
[13:37] <Laney> I don't think they hve been uploaded
[13:38] <Laney> you probably want Confirmed
[13:38] <Laney> on the Ubuntu task at least
[13:38] <ESphynx> ah
[13:38] <ESphynx> they have to be uploaded there?
[13:38] <Laney> yes, once uploaded they enter that queue to be reviewed by the SRU team
[13:39] <ESphynx> there should be something to say the bug has been fixed and the patch is available :|
[13:42] <Laney> if you want it to be uploaded then subscribe the sponsor team
[13:43] <tumbleweed> ESphynx: there is something to say a patch is available. Attach a patch / link a branch
[13:43] <tumbleweed> or even better, close the bug, with a new upload into the development release
[13:43] <ESphynx> in the status, I meant tumbleweed :P
[13:44] <ESphynx> close the bug? I just went through all this trouble opening these 14 bugs :P
[13:44] <tumbleweed> in that case, link the bugs to the upstream project. You can use your project's statuses however you like
[13:44] <ESphynx> tumbleweed yeah but this is specific to an SRU :P
[13:44] <tumbleweed> SRUs can't be accepted into stable releases until they've been fixed in the development release
[13:44] <ESphynx> I have my own tracker on ecere.com/mantis/ :P
[13:44] <ESphynx> tumbleweed: these bugs are all fixed in the development release
[13:45] <tumbleweed> LP can deal with external bug trackers for upstreams
[13:45] <tumbleweed> ESphynx: then they should be marked as being fixed in the development release, that' seasy
[13:45] <ESphynx> tumbleweed: is it?
[13:45] <ESphynx> these bugs I filed I strictly for the SRU
[13:45] <ESphynx> are*
[13:45] <Laney> once the nomination for Quantal is accepted you'll have two entries
[13:47] <ESphynx> why 2 entries?
[13:48] <Laney> one for the development release and one for quantal
[13:48] <Laney> set the development release one to Fix Released because it is fixed there
[13:48] <ESphynx> but they're not issues in the developemtn release
[13:48] <ESphynx> they're only isues in Quantal
[13:49] <tumbleweed> in otehr words they've been fixed in the development release
[13:50] <ESphynx> they've been in a totally non-Ubuntu related way.
[13:50] <tumbleweed> that's totally normal
[13:50] <ESphynx> right.
[13:55] <ESphynx> micahg: Please take a look @ https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecere-sdk/+bugs when you have a chance
[14:02] <ESphynx> well, good night gus
[14:02] <ESphynx> guys*
[14:22] <xnox> ESphynx: it can be raring=invalid quantal=confirmed if that makes it easier to understand that bug affects quantal only.
[16:41] <xnox> http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&keywords=freeze.py&searchon=contents
[16:41] <xnox> No contents information available for this suite
[16:45] <micahg> xnox: I see a few of them with apt-file
[16:48] <xnox> yeah, if one goes to http://packages.ubuntu.com/freeze.py and then first clicks raring, and then switches to contents - they appear.
