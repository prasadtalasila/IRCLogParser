[06:43] <lifeless> ajmitch: vm's ++
[06:43] <lifeless> ajmitch: openstack it up :)
[06:43] <lifeless> G: you're almost at the density you want to go for a chassis system
[06:44] <lifeless> hads: the NUC - how readily available are they? And can it do sky ? :)
[07:19] <G> lifeless: doubt I could justify that to the boss :)
[07:20] <G> lifeless: plus, I'm not sure I'd want the powerbill
[07:20] <lifeless> G: :>
[07:21] <G> lifeless: they seem fairly available, I picked one up at PB today, and everyone seems to be stocking them now
[07:22] <lifeless> G: nucs?
[07:22] <G> lifeless: yeah
[07:22] <lifeless> I thought you meant http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/3709945-3709945-4006962-4006961-4006963-4012659.html?dnr=1 for a second
[18:37] <hads> lifeless: Yeah what G said, the NUC is available from Ingram, the distributor that most online shops use, so you should be able to find it all over.
[18:39] <hads> I have them listed for $550, others have them listed for ~$500
