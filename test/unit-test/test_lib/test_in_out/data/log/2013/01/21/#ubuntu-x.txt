[10:05] <mlankhorst> morning
[10:15] <tjaalton> uploaded -intel 2.20.19 with sna
[10:17] <mlankhorst> weird, so libradeonsi.a is suddenly 27mb, but each individual object summed together is much smaller
[10:19] <mlankhorst> oh, links to libradeon
[10:24] <tjaalton> we're going to drop it from raring anyway, would it be uncool to drop from quantal too?
[10:43] <mlankhorst> what do you mean?
[10:43] <tjaalton> radeonsi is disabled in my mesa snapshot
[10:44] <tjaalton> because the llvm backend was moved to llvm, and will be released with 3.3
[10:44] <mlankhorst> oh that
[10:46] <mlankhorst> I'd rather keep the quantal lts stack's support identical to quantal. I was thinking of trying to move everything in drivers/* to libgallium, to see if it reduces the object size some. I wonder if llvm's static libs are duplicated multiple times..
[10:47] <tjaalton> sure
[11:08] <mlankhorst> hm doesn't look easy, I'll try an evil hack
[11:08] <mlankhorst> just building llvm shared from the static files it has
[11:53] <mlankhorst> didn't seem to affect size much, though :(
[11:53] <tjaalton> hrm
[11:58] <mlankhorst> I guess everything would already be pulled in from -lLLVM-3.1
[12:01] <mlankhorst> also reduces the possibility of making it even smaller :(
[13:27] <tjaalton> so, now I actually uploaded -intel..
[15:07] <mlankhorst> phew, didn't do a reboot in my chroot this time, almost did though :P
