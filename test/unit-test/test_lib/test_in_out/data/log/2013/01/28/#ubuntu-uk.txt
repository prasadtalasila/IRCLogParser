[10:15] <mungbean> hi guys, does anyone know of a good solution for easily scanning around 1000 photos? i have a scanner but scanning whole A4 page and cropping is tedious
[10:16] <popey> get someone else to do it?
[10:16] <popey> ~13p each
[10:17] <mungbean> i notice there's a agfa photo scanner ~33
[10:18] <mungbean> popey, where for 13p? i';m seeing £75 for 1000 photos
[10:18] <popey> http://www.iphotoscanning.co.uk/photo-scanning-service-1/scan-my-photographs/high-quality-photo-scanning.html
[10:18] <popey> first hit from google, I'm sure shopping around yeilds better results
[10:19] <mungbean> argh, maths fail 13p is more than 7.5p
[10:20] <brobostigon> good morning everyone.
[10:23] <solarcloud_3srcn> morning.. one cheese and bacon toastie later on ...
[10:23] <brobostigon> yummy,
[10:24] <solarcloud_3srcn> mayo too !
[10:24] <solarcloud_3srcn> brobostigon: Morning..
[10:24] <brobostigon> morning
[10:24] <solarcloud_3srcn> The weather is set to get alot worse BTW...
[10:29] <brobostigon> solarcloud_3srcn: the weather looks like it will be fine here, except for some patches of rain.
[10:32] <diplo> I found funny this morning, set for rain and wind today and temp around 5-10 degrees but on the way to work there were gritters on the roads?!?!?
[10:33] <mungbean> what does everyone else do for scanning 100s of family photosthen?
[10:33] <diplo> Scan them and crop them, I just do it when I have some time
[10:33] <diplo> Over a few weeks/months
[10:34] <solarcloud_3srcn> I put them on multiple cd's/ dvd's.
[10:34] <bubu> morn guys
[10:34] <solarcloud_3srcn> hi there.
[10:35] <bubu> having a cron issue; 30 10 * * * . cd /opt/systems/chefbackup && knife exec chef_server_backup.rb results in cron failure: /bin/sh 1: .: cd: not found
[10:36] <mgdm> what's the . for?
[10:36] <mgdm> you can't 'source' cd, it's a shell built-in command
[10:36] <bubu> i just want it to run ' knife exec chef_server_backup ' from the /opt/systems/chefbackup folder
[10:36] <mgdm> remove the .
[10:37] <bubu> kk
[10:37] <bubu> balls, now getting ERROR: ArgumentError: cannot sign the request without a client name
[10:37] <bubu> so the script fails
[10:38] <bubu> i need to load an environment I guess
[10:38] <bubu> when I run the command manually it runs ok...
[10:39] <mgdm> when things run from cron they generally have next to no environment variables set
[10:39] <mgdm> etc
[10:40] <bubu> ok - so how would you set the needed variables?
[10:41] <mgdm> I would put the whole command into a shell script and call that from cron
[10:41] <mgdm> then you can set what you like inside the script
[10:42] <mungbean> +1
[10:42] <bubu> hmm
[10:42] <bubu> i just need cron to load root's bash_profile env
[10:44] <bubu> i just need cron to load root's bash_profile env
[10:44] <bubu> oops apologies
[10:47] <bubu> would * 10 * * * . /root/.bash_profile && cd /opt/systems/chefbackup && knife exec chef_server_backup.rb
[10:48] <brobostigon> wow, just running apt-get update and it hit a load figure of 42 on my eeepc,
[10:48] <bubu> load my env from roots bash_profile?
[10:48] <bubu> lol brobostigon
[10:48] <brobostigon> bubu: it isnt funny, i am not lieing.
[10:49] <SuperMatt> bubu: get replace that first * with a minute!
[10:49] <SuperMatt> otherwise it runs every minute between 10 and 11
[10:49] <bubu> ja the time was just an example
[10:49] <mgdm> bubu: I'd move the bits you need into /root/.profile instead
[10:50] <mgdm> I think that should work, at least...
[10:51] <bubu> mgdm why .profile out of interest?
[10:56] <bubu> bash_profile seems to have worked ok
[10:56] <mgdm> there's .profile, .bash_profile and .bashrc which all run at different times
[10:56] <mgdm> I forget which, though
[11:04] <davmor2> Morning all
[11:26] <davmor2> czajkowski: prod, morning you scary cow'd backdrop feeling person you ;)
[11:27] <czajkowski> ello
[11:29] <davmor2> czajkowski: it took me ages to figure out that it was hippos teeth in a cows mouth :D tis a funny backdrop though
[11:29] <czajkowski> :)
[11:42] <bigcalm> Ello peeps :)
[11:43] <davmor2> bigcalm: How do
[11:44] <bigcalm> davmor2: 2h 43m into holiday and I'm bored
[11:44] <bigcalm> Might play some HL in a bit
[11:44] <popey> holiday!
[11:44] <bigcalm> Forgot that I had booked a week off to mirror Hayley's week off
[11:45] <davmor2> bigcalm: Muhahahahaha that'll teach you!
[11:46]  * bigcalm looks at new SSD for his new machine
[11:47] <dwatkins> I was considering that yesterday, I wonder what the sweet-spot is for price vs capacity right now
[11:48] <bigcalm> Do I take Corey Goldberg's word that I'd have to do a fresh install rather than being able to move my current SSD over?
[11:48] <popey> who?
[11:48] <bigcalm> popey: yeah, that's what I thought
[11:49] <dwatkins> I would probably just use clonezilla.
[11:49] <bigcalm> https://plus.google.com/u/1/113834766641843352499/posts/cRKKn5PhDsR
[11:49] <mgdm> I used dd last time I moved HDs, but if I do get an SSD I'm just doing a clean install
[11:54] <davmor2> popey: works for canonical in QA for U1
[11:54] <davmor2> bigcalm: drop the ssd in see what happen
[12:08] <bigcalm> davmor2: that's what I was thinking. But I'd like to have things ready to a degree
[12:10] <davmor2> bigcalm: it shouldn't have an issue with new hardware the only thing a fresh install will really do is ensure nothing dies a death and if binary drivers have been previously installed that are different ie old box is Ati new box is nvidia etc
[12:11] <bigcalm> davmor2: thankfully it's nVidia in old and new. But I understand the point
[12:11] <bigcalm> I might leave this ssd in this machine as a backup
[12:11]  * popey hugs SSD
[12:13] <bigcalm> The new machine comes with a 1TB HDD. Shame it won't be used
[12:15] <popey> desktop?
[12:16] <bigcalm> http://www.dell.com/uk/p/alienware-x51/pd?oc=d00and49&model_id=alienware-x51
[12:16] <popey> gosh
[12:16] <popey> why is the 1TB not used?
[12:17] <popey> stick it in a USB3 caddy?
[12:17] <popey> use it for backups etc
[12:18] <bigcalm> That is a sensible idea
[13:25] <dwatkins> I have several spare drives, I seem to buy a new external caddy every couple months for various reasons
[13:26] <dwatkins> I made a point of getting one that supports eSATA this time, so accessing it should be nice and quick.
=== GentileBen is now known as SirCrispinTheJew
[14:13] <awilkins> dwatkins, I had real issues with external caddies for a while
[14:13] <awilkins> dwatkins, I think the power electronics on a lot of them are cheap and they fail
[14:14] <awilkins> dwatkins, Also had drives fail due to physical shock ; since I went SSD both these problems have ended because they're shockproof and low-power
[14:15] <dwatkins> ah yes
[14:16] <awilkins> I'm really liking my current caddy which has a 2.5" docking bay but also works externally
[14:18] <awilkins> eSATA or USB
[14:19] <awilkins> This one isn't as nice http://www.scan.co.uk/products/icybox-ib-266stusd-b-black-hdd-case-usb2-esata-for-25-sata-hard-drive-inc-35-docking-station
[14:51] <Azelphur> O.o my electric oven just went nuts and started spewing out smoke at about the same rate as a typical fog machine
[14:55] <dwatkins> which is the nice one, awilkins?
[14:56] <awilkins> Can't see it anymore, it's a Silverstone
[14:56] <dwatkins> ah yes, good stuff
[14:56] <dwatkins> I just bought their 5.25" slot loading aluminium bay cover
[14:57] <awilkins> This one : http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=932&num=1
[15:19] <dwatkins> cool ta

[16:27] <lubotu3> Ubuntu bug 1107866 in unity (Ubuntu) "Show window list when right clicking an icon in launcher - enables quick window switching" [Wishlist,Triaged]
[16:36] <SuperMatt> is anyone getting 503 on sabdfl's blog?
[16:36] <ali1234> popey: the reply to it sounds familiar too
[16:36] <ali1234> how does one become a member of the design team?
[16:36] <ali1234> maybe if we could get enough sensible people onto it, unity could be fixed?
[16:37] <aptanet> can anyone think of a reason why I can't switch monitors until I get below the 5th icon down on the dash?
[16:38] <aptanet> ooh, ooh, me, me I've just thought of why
[16:38] <aptanet> different screen sizes - doh!
[16:38] <aptanet> I'll go back to sleep now ;)
[16:38] <SuperMatt> popey: that patch is gonna be cool :)
[16:40] <popey> ali1234: ask jnick_tait ☺
[16:41] <ali1234> what does "ayatana design" team actually produce?
[16:41] <ali1234> they have no blueprints and nothing in bzr
[16:41] <ali1234> shouldn't there be a design document somewhere?
[16:42] <ali1234> or is being an impenetrable roadblock to progress their only purpose?
[16:42] <popey> its a method to allow the design team to track stuff
[16:42] <popey> to work around the bug management in launchpad
[16:43] <popey> http://people.canonical.com/~platform/design/upstream.html
[16:43] <popey> powers that
[16:44] <ali1234> so what does it mean when a bug is "fix commited" in ayatana design?
[16:44] <ali1234> what is the fix commited to exactly?
[16:45] <arsen> presumably committed to the next release? :s
[16:46] <ali1234> but ayatana design doesn't release anything
[16:46] <ali1234> it is still marked as wishlist in unity
[16:46] <ali1234> sorry, triaged
[16:48] <popey> it's for managing their workflow
[16:48] <popey> to indicate that design have signed off on bugs
[16:50] <SuperMatt> holy... I just noticed one of my bugs in on the design bugs for ubuntu page
[16:51] <ali1234> that's because it is auto generated
[16:51] <SuperMatt> oh right
[16:51] <SuperMatt> nice to see my bug is high priority though
[16:51] <SuperMatt> it's the one where unity captures the superkey when you're using a vm or vnc
[16:51] <SuperMatt> which is terribly frustrating
[16:53] <ali1234> just disable super and alt in unity config
[16:53] <ali1234> in ccsm
[16:53] <ali1234> it's not like they do anything useful
[16:53] <SuperMatt> ...
[16:53] <SuperMatt> except open the dash
[16:53] <SuperMatt> which I do all the time
[16:53] <SuperMatt> but I don't want to open the dash in a vm or vnc
[16:54] <ali1234> who even opens the dash?
[16:54] <popey> i do, all the time
[16:54] <SuperMatt> me too
[16:54] <popey> well, when I open apps
[16:54] <ali1234> there's no reason to do so
[16:54] <ali1234> it's much more efficient to launch apps from a terminal window
[16:54] <SuperMatt> it's the quickets way to open apps
[16:54] <popey> nah
[16:54] <ali1234> because terminal windows are open all the time
[16:54] <ali1234> then you just pin them
[16:55] <SuperMatt> I don't want to have to open a terminal window for every app I want to run
[16:55] <popey> i find it faster to use dash
[16:55] <ali1234> then you don't ever have to wait three seconds for the dash to open and then futz around in an annoying mess of amazon junk :)
[16:55] <popey> super, ge, enter, \o/ gedit
[16:55] <MartijnVdS> </queen_nl><king_nl>
[16:55] <SuperMatt> also: super -> text is less keystrokes than ctrl+alt+t -> text
[16:55] <MartijnVdS> popey: I use alt+f2
[16:55] <popey> also end up with terminals kicking around
[16:55] <popey> that too
[16:56] <ali1234> who doesn't have terminals open?
[16:56] <popey> i have one
[16:56] <popey> the one I am typing at you in
[16:56] <ali1234> one is more than enough
[16:56] <MartijnVdS> popey: because I don't think "super" looks in original language (English) descriptions, only in localised ones
[16:56] <rowinggolfer> popey, I am surprised to see that www.ubuntu.com has no ipv6 support
[16:56] <popey> I am not.
[16:56] <rowinggolfer> popey, surely you should be trend setting?
[16:57] <rowinggolfer> you == canonical
[16:57] <rowinggolfer> ;)
[16:57] <popey> file a bug
[16:57] <rowinggolfer> popey :)
[16:57] <SuperMatt> ideally I think people would like to see ipv6 repos, and I'm certain I've been a bug about that
[16:58] <SuperMatt> but surely ipv6 can access the ipv4 address space?
