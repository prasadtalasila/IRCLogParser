[00:45] <Derpyeah> I am trying to install action replay dsi pc code manager in wine
[00:46] <Derpyeah> I installed it in playonlinux and it works perfectly except that it won't detect when the Action Replay is connected via Usb
[00:46] <Derpyeah> I tried to install directly in wine but now I'm getting a load failed and still nothing is detected.
[00:46] <Derpyeah> Does anyone have any tips?

[08:31] <Gazra> Hello, anyone here?
[08:31] <Gazra> I would like to improve the Lubuntu user experience
[08:32] <Gazra> I have been using Lubuntu for 2 years now, and for every new installation I need to highly customize.
[08:33] <Gazra> I would like to make my cutomizations permanent, so that other can benefit from them too.
[08:33] <Gazra> Any advice where I can do this?
[08:36] <tsimpson> !remaster | Gazra
[08:36] <ubottu> Gazra: Interested in remastering the Ubuntu !LiveCD or !Alternate installer? See: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization - Or use tools such as http://uck.sourceforge.net/ or http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/DRU_Disc_Remastering_Utility
[08:37] <tsimpson> you can spin your own custom ISOs
[08:37] <Gazra> Well, that's nice, but I would like to do it for the standard Lubuntu distro.
[08:38] <tsimpson> then you'd want to report a bug in Launchpad against lubuntu-meta
[08:38] <tsimpson> or possibly several bugs
[08:42] <Gazra> Wishes qulify as bugs?
[08:44] <tsimpson> yes
[08:44] <tsimpson> you can even mark them as Wishlist

[15:39] <poq> Hi all. Does any printable info which I can print exist which could men that my OS is legal?
[15:39] <poq> mean*
[15:43] <inductiveload> poq: legal?
[15:43] <poq> yes
[15:43] <poq>  I need that info to show it to some stupid instances of policemans to make them believe that my OS and soft are ok
[15:45] <inductiveload> well, things can be under various licences
[15:45] <inductiveload> the kenrel itself is GPLv2
[15:47] <inductiveload> http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/COPYING
[15:49] <inductiveload> of course you might still have proprietary drivers, and each program you have could be under a different licence
[15:54] <inductiveload> and that doesn't include things like encryption software (ssh, for example) which could be illegal regardless of licence
[15:54] <inductiveload> depending on where you are
[15:58] <poq> all looks harder than I thought
[15:59] <inductiveload> back in a bit

[21:18] <Analogymous> Hello
[21:18] <Analogymous> I am experiencing a bug with 12.10 and nvidia-173 drivers
[21:19] <Analogymous> it is not compatible with xserver-xorg-abi-11 and 12
[21:19] <Analogymous> anyone knows a fix?
[21:27] <dencrypt> Analogymous: try another driver
[21:28] <Analogymous> Tried -current which doesn't support my graphics card
[21:28] <Analogymous> don't think -96 is compatible either
[21:28] <dencrypt> Have you tried Nouveau?
[21:33] <Analogymous> I run nouveau but it crashes a lot
[21:34] <Analogymous> I am trying some games but even the lightest of them crashes
