[17:20] <cjwatson> kentb: Hey; have you had a chance to try today's server build for 4K logical sector UEFI installs?
[17:22] <kentb> cjwatson, just did.  Your commits gets us over the hump with regard to disk partitioning and the installation runs to completion.  However, upon reboot, the system won't boot the OS.  It's almost as if there's no EFI boot information written to the disk.
[17:22] <cjwatson> OK, can I have the usual giant pile of logs?
[17:22] <kentb> cjwatson, ok. I'll gather them and drop them off in the bug
[17:44] <cjwatson> kentb: Thanks
