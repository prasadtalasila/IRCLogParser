[05:21] <superfly> they have a truly awesome idea
[05:27] <superfly> nlsthzn: don't forget that you can submit portals in Ingress - so you could arguably eventually own the entire city when they approve your submissions ;-)
[05:37] <nlsthzn> haha... been thinking of that superfly ... going to the shops in a bit so seeing as I have to gert dressed and go outside I guess it can't hurt to give it a go too

[08:35] <nlsthzn> my battery is almost charged then it is ingress time for half an hour strong
[08:41] <inetpro> Kilos: you think I was not thinking?
[08:45] <inetpro> Kilos: if you think you think then you just think that you are thinking
[08:45] <Kilos> lol twit
[08:45] <inetpro> Kilos: there's a nice german song about that
[08:45] <inetpro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z63y0B4A9rs

[09:17] <nlsthzn> eish... what am I watching and more imprtantly listening too :/
[09:18] <nlsthzn> superfly, just finished the tutorial... and seeing as the poor enlightened are having there buts kicked I have requested a change in faction

[10:43] <nlsthzn> got to wonder about our wonderful country sometimes http://youtu.be/C0NLwAIpPdA
[10:44] <Kilos> Maaz, whats for lunch
[10:44] <Maaz> Kentucky for the workers and a peanut butter sarmy for the idle rich
[12:16] <inetpro> anyone of you know someone who gets the printed versions of Autotrader?
[12:16] <inetpro> version*
[12:17]  * inetpro looking for details of an ad that was placed two weeks ago and no longer online
[12:18] <inetpro> or perhaps you know someone at autotrader?
[12:18] <inetpro> submitting a customer service query is a fruitless exercise
[12:19] <inetpro> or at least seems to be useless
[12:54] <liam__> no idea, sorry
=== Trix[a]r_za is now known as Trixar_za
[13:00] <Trixar_za> ouch, 40 seconds fast
[13:00] <Trixar_za> I really should sync my time more often

[13:01] <Trixar_za> How is it's CMOS battery?
[13:02] <superfly> should be fine, it is less than 2 years old
[13:03] <Trixar_za> Should be fine then
[13:04] <Trixar_za> Do you sync the system clock when you sync the clock in the OS?
[13:07] <superfly> dunno, I just saw it the other day, and ran ntpdate
[13:07] <superfly> it doesn't matter, really, it's a server at home
[13:23]  * magespawn goes to google how to sync time on a server
=== Trixar_za is now known as Trix[a]r_za

[18:06] <Trixar_za> Hey again Kilos
[18:07] <Trixar_za> I also won't worry too much about the people
[18:07] <Trixar_za> It tends to happen around summer :P
[18:08] <Kilos> ai
[18:17] <Trixar_za> I attribute it to being too hot to sit behind a computer/laptop when you could rather be out drinking in a pub or swimming in a pool.
[18:20] <Kilos> lol
[18:21] <Kilos> fans help
[18:21] <Kilos> mine keeps me cool here
=== Trixar_za is now known as Trix[a]r_za
[18:39] <Kilos> hi tumbleweed do you have a link showing which of the dev team does what?
[18:43] <Kilos> hi zeref wb
[18:43] <tumbleweed> Kilos: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers
[18:43] <Kilos> ty tumbleweed 
[19:00] <Kilos> night all. sleep tight
[19:16] <Squirm> I think bed may be an idea
[19:16] <Squirm> magespawn: was it you who pointed me to where I should upload my public key to become an official member?
[19:17] <Squirm> actually learnt about public/private key pairs on course today and now they make sense. whereas before I was just following commands, so I probably did stuff wrong
[19:17] <Squirm> and for the life of me I can't remember the website name, even though it's a common website
[19:18] <Squirm> superfly would know to :)
[19:18] <Squirm> s/to/too
[19:19] <superfly> Squirm: eh?
[19:20] <superfly> Squirm: you mean Launchpad?
[19:20] <Squirm> that's the one :/ I couldn't remember Launchpad
[19:20]  * Squirm uploads his key
[19:21] <superfly> Squirm: I think you're specifically looking for this: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-za
[19:23] <Squirm> superfly: probably
[19:30] <Squirm> ah, superfly, it was the option I saw about importing a public key into launchpad
[19:30] <Squirm> and I joined the team
[19:30] <superfly> Squirm: right, cause you need to sign the code of conduct with your key
[19:35] <Squirm> superfly: is it better to create a say, work key and a personal key, or add 2 identities(email addresses) to 1 key?
[19:36] <superfly> Squirm: I don't really know, but from what I've seen in the wild, multiple keys are not necessarily a bad thing
[19:36] <Squirm> good :P
[19:36] <Squirm> 'tis what I've done
[19:43] <Squirm> done
[19:50] <Squirm> the gpg thing was actually quite interesting
[19:55] <Squirm> cool, all my emails will be signed
[21:13] <inetpro> Maaz: tell kilos pong. Just had a bad headache since afternoon but better now. 
[21:14] <Maaz> inetpro: Okay, I'll tell Kilos on freenode
[21:47] <bakuman> here \o/
