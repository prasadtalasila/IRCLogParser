[09:07] <xiaoy> I just installed chinese language support, installed all the input methods and set it right, but in lubuntu i cannot start ibus (the input method)
[09:08] <xiaoy> nobody has had experience with that?
[09:32] <xiaoy> ok, so eventually i found the solution for ibus not showing in lubuntu. for people interested, here there is the solution: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ibus/+bug/1041933
[09:32] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1041933 in ibus (Ubuntu) "IBUS does not open when selected from menu or applications from within filemanager (PCmanfm )" [Undecided,Confirmed]

[11:57] <BWMerlin> I am having an issue with Chrome sometimes opening when clicking on hyperlinks or external programmes opening web pages even though firefox has been set as the default browser
[11:57] <BWMerlin> how do i stop this from happening?/
[12:06] <inductiveload> BWMerlin: how did you set firefox as default?
[12:08] <BWMerlin> both in the browser and in the preferred applications
[12:08] <BWMerlin> I think when I choose firefox as default browser at first launch it set it in preferred applications
[12:11] <inductiveload> can you do xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop

[13:00] <xiaoy> Hi, is there a good guide on how to add icons on lxpannel?
[13:02] <inductiveload> BWMerlin: hmm, then i'm not sure (i'm 80% sure I did that on my machine, which I don't have to hand here)
[13:02] <xiaoy> ok, find out by myself...
[13:02] <inductiveload> xiaoy: in what way? you mean a quick lauch area?
[13:03] <xiaoy> yea, i found out already, tkz :)
[13:03] <inductiveload> okeydokey
[13:03] <BWMerlin> right click, add/remove panel item, panel applet, application launcher and then add what ever you like
[13:03] <BWMerlin> inductiveload: thanks for the help
[13:03] <xiaoy> inductiveload, BWMerlin tkz
[13:04] <xiaoy> another question, how is called the screenshot taker in lubuntu? i need to install it
[13:10] <inductiveload> xiaoy: "scrot"
[13:11] <xiaoy> inductiveload, thank you
[13:11] <inductiveload> you should be able to just press "print screen" on the keyboard
[13:13] <xiaoy> inductiveload, something more "graphic"?
[13:13] <xiaoy> :)
[13:14] <xiaoy> shutter seems a bit heavy on my machine, dunno, maybe i should give it a try...
[13:14] <xiaoy> if i can't find anything lighter
[13:17] <xiaoy> maybe a scrot frontend would be great...
[13:17] <xiaoy> what about gscreenshot?
[13:21] <inductiveload> xiaoy: i just use scrot, i rarely need to use it anyway
[13:21] <inductiveload> i have used shutter but it's loaded with useless junk
[13:21] <inductiveload> no idea about others, sorry
[13:25] <xiaoy> inductiveload, np thank you
