[13:49] <gary_poster> hey, people, claim some reviews!
[13:51] <benji> gary_poster: hmm, I tried to claim "Reformat the project documentation" (and already did the review) but my tag didn't stick.
[13:51] <benji> so, if you've not already done it, you don't strictly have to do that one (it has two reviews now)
[13:52] <gary_poster> benji, I did it and fixed it.  I need to remember to reload the page after a night.  Apparently page updates stop after a while
[13:52] <benji> oh! is that it?
[13:52] <gary_poster> I mean, I messed up your tags and fixed it, benji.  Thanks
[13:53] <gary_poster> that's the story for me, yeah.  Maybe it stops updating after inactivity or something
[13:53] <benji> I need to remember that.  That sounds like a bug report in waiting.
[13:53] <gary_poster> if you ever want to know what the heck is going on, I find the "history" tab for each card helps a lot
[13:53] <gary_poster> yeah, good idea
[14:18] <gary_poster> teknico, you have two reviews for one of your branches.  I reviewed bug 1099816, but you need someone else for that one
[14:18] <_mup_> Bug #1099816: Revise project docs <juju-gui:In Progress by teknico> < https://launchpad.net/bugs/1099816 >
[14:18] <teknico> gary_poster, yes, I'm answering to those remarks right now, thanks
[14:19] <gary_poster> cool teknico 
[14:19] <teknico> s/ to //
[14:20] <gary_poster> :-)
[14:23] <benji> I will take a look at the 1099816 branch.
[14:23] <gary_poster> thanks benji
[14:31] <hazmat> i need a pyjuju review to help the ls integration go forward.. bcsaller, jimbaker.. or anyone else if you have a moment could you look at https://codereview.appspot.com/7092055/
[14:31] <bcsaller> hazmat: doing it now
[14:31] <hazmat> bcsaller, thanks
[14:37] <hazmat> therve, afaics that should take care of the issue for identifying multiple envs from the ls subordinate. w/ the branch there's a JUJU_ENV_ID hex uuid env var available in all hooks
[14:43] <therve> hazmat, yeah I had a look, seems great
=== Makyo|out is now known as Makyo
[14:52] <jimbaker> hazmat, also +1 on the branch, makes a lot of sense, but i'll let bcsaller do the more detailed review
[14:53] <hazmat> jimbaker, thanks
[14:58] <gary_poster> frankban, made a code-only review of https://codereview.appspot.com/7095058/ that has some things to which you could respond.  Will qa your branch now.
[14:58] <frankban> gary_poster: looking, thanks
[14:58] <gary_poster> welcome, ty
[15:28] <frankban> gary_poster: replied to your comments
[15:28] <gary_poster> alejandraobregon bac bcsaller benji frankban goodspud hazmat Makyo teknico call in 2
[15:28] <gary_poster> frankban, cool, looking.  I got sidetracked by finding two bugs that I think are in trunk
[15:28] <gary_poster> once I file those I'll return to qa
[15:31] <gary_poster> bac benji starting without you
[15:39] <gary_poster> bac forgot you were out today but eventually remembered :-)
[15:39] <hazmat> noticing on staging there's some odd interaction w/ double click and the service menu on the canvas
[15:40] <hazmat> ie. double click 'zooms' to the svc page,  but leaves the svc menu open on the canvas.
[15:42] <gary_poster> hazmat duped; will file bug
[15:53] <benji> we could use a loading message, the hash mark background stays up just long enough that you wonder what the app is doing
[15:59] <gary_poster> yeah, good idea benji
[16:46] <goodspud> Hey all. I've updated the meeting invite with a link to the "wires" we'll be going through shortly
[16:48] <gary_poster> thanks goodspud 
[16:49] <gary_poster> Makyo, fwiw your expertise might come in handy for bug 1099921, when you get a chance.
[16:49] <_mup_> Bug #1099921: Dragging services fails intermittently <juju-gui:Triaged> < https://launchpad.net/bugs/1099921 >
[16:50] <frankban> teknico: is "readOnly" so bad? ;-)
[16:50] <teknico> frankban, well, yes, it's weird :-)
[16:52] <gary_poster> bah :-)
[16:52] <frankban> hum... "I'm a wierdo... What the hell am I doing here"...
[16:53] <gary_poster> two words certainly has precedence
[16:53] <gary_poster> Wikipedia has "read-only"
[16:53] <gary_poster> salesforce API uses ReadOnly
[16:57]  * gary_poster not sure whether to give 2 mi nwarning for UI call
[16:58] <goodspud> gary_poster, haven't you effectively just done that?
[16:58] <gary_poster> goodspud, not with all the pingy goodness :-)
[16:59] <teknico> uhm, I can't find Googlle Hangout via the map link on the invite ;-)
[16:59] <gary_poster> bcsaller, benji hazmat Makyo teknico if you want to come we are in juju-ui
[17:02] <gary_poster> arosales, actually you might want to join to. up to you.  inspector panel presentation in juju-ui from Nick
[17:06] <benji> bcsaller: I muted your keyboard. ;)
[17:07] <arosales> gary_poster: ah, ok. let me see if I can get out of the current meeting
[17:08] <gary_poster> arosales, really up to you
[17:08] <gary_poster> arosales, wanted to give you the option at least :-)
[17:08] <arosales> thanks for the fyi 
[17:08] <arosales> gary_poster: much appreciated
[17:08] <gary_poster> :-)
[18:03] <bcsaller> very poor hangout experience, lost about 50% of the audio even with reconnects
[18:03] <hazmat> bcsaller, changing the bandwith settings can help alot with that
[18:03] <bcsaller> I did :(
[18:04] <hazmat> hmm.. unfortunate.. it works wonders for me on a crappy net con
[18:06] <gary_poster> frankban, finally finished qa and tests.  land with changes.  ty
[18:07] <gary_poster> frankban, sorry for duplicate review on rietveld.  rietveld is acting up for me
[18:11] <frankban> gary_poster: thanks, just pushed new changes, could you please take another look at https://codereview.appspot.com/7095058 ?
[18:11] <gary_poster> sure frankban, will do now
[18:11] <frankban> cool thanks
[18:13] <hazmat> cool frankban
[18:13] <hazmat> hmm. getting an error from reitveld looking at readonly branch
[18:14] <hazmat> app engine, the most helpless way to fail at scale
[18:15] <hazmat> gary_poster, can you get to it?
[18:15] <hazmat> hmm.. i can't get to any reitveld reviews though the index is working
[18:16] <gary_poster> hazmat, I am able to see it via FF :-P
[18:17] <gary_poster> hazmat, frankban scratch that.  I can get to it if I am unauthenticated
[18:17] <hazmat> gary_poster, seems to be a server issue core also confirmed issues
[18:17] <gary_poster> looking at MP
[18:20] <gary_poster> frankban, +1 thank you.
[18:20] <frankban> gary_poster: cool! landing...
[18:33] <hazmat> frankban, branch looks great.. i had a question though on the notification is this the old notifications number, or the floating/growl notification that fires on these perm denied
[18:34] <frankban> hazmat: both
[18:34] <hazmat> cool, thanks
[18:41] <Makyo> Surprise parent lunch.  Will be back in a few.
[18:49] <frankban> gary_poster, hazmat: usual conflict in uistage: http://uistage.jujucharms.com:8080/juju-ui/assets/config.js
[18:52] <gary_poster> frankban, ok, trying to fix 1 sec
[18:55] <gary_poster> frankban, fixed
[18:55] <gary_poster> thanks frankban! now go away and have an evening :-)
[18:55] <frankban> gary_poster: thanks :-) have a nice evening!
[19:52] <gary_poster> bcsaller, you've fixed 1091616 previously, in one of your refactoring branches, right?
[19:54] <bcsaller> gary_poster: had to check, yes, thats covered by one of the branches I'm trying to land, still haven't gotten the pan working in conjunction with it though
[19:54] <gary_poster> bcsaller, oh ok, so in progress, thx
[19:55] <bcsaller> err, wait, I think that area related bug was covered by the viewport branch
[19:55] <bcsaller> that should be landed
[19:55] <bcsaller> the origin fix on the mouse is in the scrollwheel one
[19:55] <gary_poster> bcsaller, that's what I thought.  cool, marking it as resolved, thx
[19:55] <bcsaller> gary_poster: more than one minor in that bug :)
[19:55] <gary_poster> :-)
[20:32] <benji> hmm, so I was thinking... if the user deploys *another* juju GUI (say because there is a new version available) how are they supposed to remove the "old" one?
[20:33] <gary_poster> benji, IIUC you are not supposed to do that.  There's an explicit upgrade gesture...and I don't know what it is actually
[20:34] <benji> gary_poster: s/\([^)]+\)/SOME_GOOD_REASON_TO_WANT_TO_DEPLOY_ANOTHER_GUI_SERVICE/
[20:35] <gary_poster> benji: :-P name one
[20:35] <benji> :)
[20:35] <gary_poster> benji, if we encounter this we can change this code to a warning with a wink and a song, yeah?
[20:35] <benji> if you can't think of one, then my fears are assuaged (I can't believe I spelled that right on the first try)
[20:36] <gary_poster> in a world where winks and songs are inexpensivem to be clear
[20:36] <bcsaller> or add an update gui button when a new version is detected
[20:36] <gary_poster> :-)
[20:36] <gary_poster> yeah bcsaller 
[20:36] <gary_poster> the update story is the only one I know of
[20:36]  * benji dumps his wink and song derrivatives portfolio in fear of a market crash
[20:36] <gary_poster> but if there is one we can address that then
[20:36] <gary_poster> heh
[20:37] <benji> cool, I wanted to be sure that wasn't a stopper
[20:37] <gary_poster> cool thanks
[20:40] <benji> does anyone know of any tests that render templats and then inspect the results? (I can't find any after a quick inspection.)
[20:46] <gary_poster> um.  maybe charm panel.  looking.
[20:48] <gary_poster> bcsaller, did you mean to merge?  I'm ok with it, but it had 1 in-progress review total afaict :-)
[20:49] <bcsaller> gary_poster: I did, I thought there was one with issues and one w/o and I fixed the issues and repaired the behavior
[20:50] <bcsaller> but I might have jumped the gun
[20:50] <gary_poster> bcsaller, oh cool, I didn't see second review--and excellent news that that is landed.  should have looked closer than my mail program to see the second review.  all is well, was just wondering :-)
[20:51] <gary_poster> benji, test_charm_panel effectively is testing the rendering of templates...oh, but you want the template in isolation?
[20:51] <benji> yep
[20:51] <benji> most of the changes in my branch are to templates and it seems sanest to test them directly 
[20:52] <benji> I'm looking at the template infrastructure to see how to do what I want and it looks pretty easy
[20:52] <gary_poster> benji gotcha.  no, no examples I know of.  I'd just do Y.Node (Y.one etc.) with get('text') or whatever
[20:52] <gary_poster> but would be coll to see something niftier
[20:52] <gary_poster> cool
[20:54] <gary_poster> removing relations in env view is broken ("Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'one' of null")
[20:54] <gary_poster> will file bug anon
[20:58] <gary_poster> Makyo, reviewing your recent branch.  Question about line 548 of https://codereview.appspot.com/7095061/diff/1/app/views/topology/service.js?column_width=80
[20:58] <gary_poster> (right hand side)
[20:59] <gary_poster> is that mutating the data-outerradius within a function that is supposed to get a value?
[20:59] <gary_poster> I don't know the d3 spelling well enough
[21:01] <Makyo> gary_poster, yes.  It's keeping that value up to date, solely for testability.
[21:02] <Makyo> gary_poster, <path>'s d attribute doesn't provide enough information to be able to test that behavior, and the data- prefixed attributes help provide that.
[21:03] <gary_poster> Makyo, oh I see.  Normally I'd want to separate out mutation from observation code, but for testability I'm cool with that.  Will just request explanatory comment as to the purpose of that attr
[21:04] <Makyo> gary_poster, Got it.  There's no other way to retrieve the outer radius otherwise, so I'll comment it.
[21:04] <gary_poster> Cool thanks Makyo 
[21:10] <gary_poster> hey benji, I thought our new new new style guide said that we are supposed to have var statements for each variable, but I couldn't find that.  Do you happen to remember what is up with that?
[21:10] <gary_poster> (was looking in docs/style-guide.rst)
[21:10] <benji> gary_poster: that never left the suggestion phase and ended up dying on the vine
[21:11] <gary_poster> oh ok benji
[21:11] <gary_poster> thanks
[21:19] <gary_poster> Makyo, "Land with (super trivial) changes." :-)
[21:26] <hazmat> therve, the uuid thing is merge to pyju trunk.. should be in the ppa tomorrow
[21:27] <hazmat> merged
[21:36] <gary_poster> looks like bcsaller's branch fixed the problem removing relations in the environment view also. Yay. :-)
[21:36] <gary_poster> Don't have to file that bug
[21:52] <benji> but it means that we need a bug for the missing test (0.2 wink)
[21:52] <gary_poster> benji, yeah thought crossed my mind
[22:02] <therve> hazmat, awesome!
[22:08] <gary_poster> bcsaller if you are not past your EoD, if you were able to review Makyo's https://codereview.appspot.com/7095061/ today he might be able to land it, which would be cool.
[22:08] <gary_poster> If you are past your EoD, never mind :-)
[22:08] <bcsaller> gary_poster, Makyo: I'll review that now
[22:08] <gary_poster> thank you
[23:15] <Makyo> Tests aren't running in trunk.
