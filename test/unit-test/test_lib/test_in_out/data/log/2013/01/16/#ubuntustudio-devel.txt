[00:09] <ScottL> hello again
[00:12] <ScottL> zequence, did you want to try to update the g+ ubuntu studio page to make the facebook page?
[00:15] <zequence> ScottL: Ah, I've kind of forgotten about that. Been so busy with other things. But, I was probably also waiting for you to collect the artwork. I'd like to see what else is available
[00:16] <zequence> With fb, I kind of just went ahead and updated without any staging. I'd like to stage before implementing. 
[00:17] <zequence> I should probably not do the final products. I see my work only as a pragmatic short term solution
[00:18] <zequence> ..as I don't know graphics and how to make the image have quality, not only in design, but also in how it's processed and converted to which ever file format
[00:20] <ScottL> i've gotten the artwork, i just need to finish a couple of things on it, download from bzr, merge, and push
[11:39] <ttoine> hello
[12:23]  * smartboyhw thought it is rare that zequence is away
[12:29] <smartboyhw> astraljava, so what do ya think?
[12:29] <astraljava> I'll read that page through first.
[12:29] <smartboyhw> Good:D
[12:29] <astraljava> I'm playing email pong with a customer, so it might take a while. :)
[12:29] <smartboyhw> I hate email pongs:P
[12:30] <astraljava> Don't get me started...
[12:30] <smartboyhw> Damn I need to send an email to everyone about Ubuntu QA Classroom sessions, still hasn't decided on the time...
[13:16] <smartboyhw> Hi scott-work 
[13:16] <smartboyhw> Haven't "seen" you for 3 weeks!
[13:28] <scott-work> good morning smartboyhw !  yes, it has been a while
[13:28] <smartboyhw> scott-work, :D
[13:29] <smartboyhw> How's life? I know your work is hard these days (read the log yesterday)
[13:29] <scott-work> you didn't need to throw yourself on your sword in the -release email for the reports, ultimately i believe it to be my responsibility
[13:30] <smartboyhw> scott-work, good then:D
[13:32] <smartboyhw> scott-work, actually I found we are the only distro sending these reports aren't we????
[13:33] <scott-work> smartboyhw: yes, it's been very busy, especially with year's end and a weird mix of work, but it is going okay, i'm just getting frustrated because there are other things (like skills matrix and creating a wiki) that i want, and NEED, to get done and can't seem to get to them
[13:33] <smartboyhw> Ooh
[13:34] <scott-work> smartboyhw: just to be clear, if by "reports" you mean "emails to the -release team", then everyone including lubuntu, xubuntu, kubuntu, edubuntu, the desktop team, the ux team, unity team, and metric tonne of others have and should be continuing to do so
[13:35] <scott-work> there were also "team reports" we have done in the past, i am unsure of the status of those, perhaps they are not in flavour anymore
[13:35] <smartboyhw> But they don't....
[13:35] <scott-work> "favour"
[13:35] <scott-work> hmmm, they really should....even if there isn't a meeting anymore
[13:36] <scott-work> it may be to their own disadvantage to not send things, i view it as a very good forum to update important people and get direct help
[13:36] <smartboyhw> I think that one day the Ubuntu Release Team will have to call a meeting just to call back those emails....
[13:38] <smartboyhw> When is 12.04.2 delayed till? till Alpha 2 date right?
[13:38] <smartboyhw> That will be a BIG problem for Kubuntu and Edubuntu....
[13:38] <smartboyhw> For us it is simple:D
[13:38]  * smartboyhw reminds himself to send a testing annoucement of 12.04.2 once the testing week starts
[14:57] <smartboyhw> scott-work, len-1304 zequence PING
[14:57] <smartboyhw> I can't find x86 images in http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/precise/dvd/current/
[15:06] <scott-work> interesting. and looking back into the previous (and available) folders, i don't see any there as well
[15:07] <scott-work> but hopefully your email to the release mail will yield an answer, smartboyhw 
[15:09] <smartboyhw> :D
[17:47] <scott-work> i'm not sure it's a kernel issue as per the email to -release. we don't seem to experience the same issue in the logs as mythbuntu and it looks like we are getting the kernel installed into the image without errors
[17:48] <scott-work> i'm guessing (pure speculation actually) that perhaps out image is being built fine but whatever process eventually publishes the images craps out when it reaches mythbuntu and then never makes it to our i386 image to copy?
[17:48] <scott-work> again, wild guessing
[17:51] <scott-work> bah, i'm wrong, but i don't know what the problem actually is
[17:54] <scott-work> http://kapok.buildd/~buildd/LiveCD/raring/ubuntustudio-dvd/current/livecd.ubuntustudio-dvd.kernel-lowlatency.efi.signed: 2012-12-18 18:40:38 ERROR 404: Not Found.
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
[23:07] <scott-work> going home but i'll probably be back on later
[23:19] <ttoine> falktx, would you be here ?
[23:19] <falktx> hm?
[23:20] <falktx> am I not here?
[23:26] <ttoine> great
[23:26] <ttoine> falktx, I asked you some questions in the past about jack and muti cpu
[23:26] <astraljava> I am what I am, therefore I'm here. Am I not?
[23:27] <ttoine> falktx, maybe you can explain why when I do an export in Ardour or Mixbus, only one cpu core is used ?
[23:27] <falktx> not according to schrodinger's cat
[23:28] <falktx> ttoine: because it needs data to be in sync
[23:28] <falktx> multi-cpu audio processing is very hard to do
[23:28] <ttoine> and it is not possible with multiple cpu or cores ?
[23:28] <falktx> even jack doesn't do it
[23:29] <ttoine> falktx, and what about jackdmp ?
[23:29] <falktx> same thing
[23:29] <falktx> jackdmp/jack2 just splits the rt and non-rt threads
[23:29] <falktx> the audio thread is still just 1
[23:29] <ttoine> falktx, so it means that every effects, mix, etc... in ardour is done using only one core ?
[23:30] <ttoine> even when recording or mixing ?
[23:30] <falktx> can't say for sure, but it's very likely
[23:30] <falktx> some CPU will of course go to the background threads, other to gui stuff
[23:30] <ttoine> so having more than 2 cores in not usefull... one for the system, and one for jack...
[23:30] <falktx> it is useful
[23:30] <ttoine> why ?
[23:30] <falktx> apps nowadays have multiple threads
[23:30] <falktx> usually 3
[23:30] <falktx> 1 - audio rt thread
[23:31] <falktx> 2 - background thread for lockless operations
[23:31] <falktx> 3 - gui thread
[23:31] <falktx> I bet 90% of audio apps have at least those 3
[23:31] <ttoine> gui thread can be managed by cairo/opengl/compiz etc. by the gpu, I guess
[23:32] <falktx> gui painting, not gui thread
[23:32] <falktx> but it helps, sure
[23:32] <ttoine> those 3 threads are splitted on the cores by Linux ?
[23:33] <falktx> I believe so
[23:33] <falktx> I don't know enough about these details, this is low-level stuff
[23:33] <ttoine> is there a way to fix rt audio thread on a core, and the other and the system on the other ?
[23:34] <falktx> afaik, no, the kernel decides that
[23:34] <ttoine> ok
[23:34] <ttoine> it means so that in order to have a good performance for mixing, with a lot of tracks and effects, I have to find the better "cores"
[23:35] <falktx> a high-freq quadcore seems the best option for me now
[23:35] <ttoine> the matter is that it is very subjective, because Intel and Amd don't have the same instructions sets
[23:35] <falktx> SSD disks help if you want to read/write a lot of stuff
[23:35] <falktx> Intel > AMD
[23:35] <ttoine> of course...
[23:35] <ttoine> falktx, not in all cases. AMD are very common on high computing
[23:36] <falktx> well I just dont trust AMD
[23:36] <ttoine> why ?
[23:36] <falktx> because of how they manage linux releases
[23:36] <ttoine> ?
[23:37] <falktx> it's so much unprofessionalism it's a joke
[23:37] <falktx> even the actual AMD employes don't like AMD...
[23:37] <ttoine> you think it is better to use a 32 or a 64 bits linux system ?
[23:38] <falktx> 64bit of course...
[23:38] <ttoine> ok
[23:38] <falktx> http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/amd-accuses-former-top-employees-of-stealing-over-100000-documents/
[23:38] <ttoine> maybe working on overclocking would be interesting in order to allow more tracks in Ardour / Mixbus ;-)
[23:41] <ttoine> falktx, ok. thanks
[23:42] <ttoine> very strange to see that AMD is often preferred for high power computing
[23:43] <falktx> well, I just don't like them
[23:44] <ttoine> you work with them ? or it is just like Ferrari versus Aston Martin, a personnal feeling ?
[23:45] <falktx> have you seen their graphics drivers?
[23:45] <falktx> how poor they manage that or don't care?
[23:45] <ttoine> falktx, yes I agree
[23:46] <falktx> they made several deals with Microsoft
[23:46] <falktx> I wouldn't be surprise if the lack of linux support is done on purpose
[23:46] <ttoine> the nvidia driver is not better...
[23:47] <falktx> I beg to disagree
[23:47] <ttoine> maybe for the same purpose. but it is a bit better since valve is working on the Ubuntu version
[23:47] <falktx> nvidia still has closed versions, but they don't even begin to compare with AMD
[23:49] <ttoine> nvidia provide a good driver gui. but there are still some bugs with cairo with the closed driver, and this bug isn"t in amd and intel driver
[23:50] <ttoine> falktx, nvidia driver is not recommanded by the technical support of Mixbus, because of that
[23:50] <falktx> I could care less about Mixbus, sorry
[23:51] <falktx> both amd and nvidia have their bugs
[23:51] <ttoine> don't be sorry...
[23:52] <ttoine> falktx, maybe it would be interesting to speak with jack developpers to know if jack is optimised for specific intel or amd instructions like 3Dnow!, etc.
[23:53] <ttoine> and about Mixbus, the bug will the same for Ardour 3
[23:53] <falktx> ttoine: jack is as much optimized as you compile it to
[23:54] <ttoine> falktx, so with a amd64 package in Ubuntu repositories or in kxstudio repositories, it is optimized sor Intel or Amd, or any of them ?
[23:54] <ttoine> I mean, just for common x86 64 bit ?
[23:55] <falktx> I would need to the packages
[23:55] <ttoine> ?
[23:55] <falktx> errr
[23:55] <falktx> I would need to check the packages
[23:55] <ttoine> ok
[23:56] <ttoine> falktx, thanks for you answers. it is always very interesting to chat with you.
[23:58] <falktx> sure
