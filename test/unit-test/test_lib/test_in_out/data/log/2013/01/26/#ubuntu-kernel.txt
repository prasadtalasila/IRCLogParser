[04:21] <penguin_> is anyone here a developer?
[04:27] <lifeless> not a one, we're all novellists.
[04:28] <chiluk> roses are red.
[04:28] <lifeless> intel is blue
[04:28] <penguin_> and redshift is amazing

[10:00] <infinity> jjohansen: How did you want to deal with security sign-off for the current precise/quantal SRUs?  They don't technically fix any security flaws, but they're reverts to regressions that we landed in -security.
[10:01] <infinity> jjohansen: I'm personally inclined to say we should probably copy the lot to security, due to the regression.  Thoughts?
[10:02] <jjohansen> infinity: hrmm, yes I think copying them to security makes sense.
[10:02] <jjohansen> hrmm were of the CVE patches where reverted?
[10:03] <jjohansen> s/where//
[10:03] <henrix> jjohansen: no, the reverts were not from CVE patches
[10:03] <infinity> jjohansen: The reverts were purely for fsnotify regressions.
[10:04] <infinity> jjohansen: But rather nasty ones at that.  I've already hung a couple of buildds due to that kernel.
[10:04] <jjohansen> okay, I would say yes copy to -security, and if needed I can issue a nop USN detailing that its a fix for regressions
[10:05] <infinity> jjohansen: That would be lovely.  So, if you could abuse the security-sign-off task to that effect, so the bot sets the right promotion tasks for me, that would be great.
[10:05] <jjohansen> infinity: alright, it should be done in a couple minutes
[10:12] <jjohansen> infinity, henrix: I am only seeing the precise tracking bug https://launchpad.net/bugs/1104061, do you have the quantal one handy?

[10:14] <jjohansen> ah, yeah that is quite handy

[14:22] <ben1u> hello, I had last night a kernel panic on Ubuntu 12.04 after 7 days uptime. How can I find or dump it?
[14:23] <ben1u> I mean how I can for the future find why it happened.
[14:26] <Gaudasse> syslog ?
[14:26] <ben1u> there is no information about that
[15:56] <lantizia> apw, ogasawara, is there anyway I (a 12.04 user) can run/test the kernel changes related to #1105230 raised yesterday
[16:26] <infinity> ikepanhc: Yay for the armadaxp uploads.  Do I get a matching -meta too?
[16:28] <ikepanhc> infinity: not upload meta packages yet, will do so. upload kernel first because it takes time to build
[16:28] <infinity> ikepanhc: Yeah, but no harm in doing both together, I don't copy them from the PPA until everything's ready.
[16:28] <infinity> ikepanhc: (And it means you don't have to babysit)
[16:29] <ikepanhc> :)
[16:47] <infinity> ikepanhc: I'll go grab some breakfast and hope to see a meta when I get back. :)
