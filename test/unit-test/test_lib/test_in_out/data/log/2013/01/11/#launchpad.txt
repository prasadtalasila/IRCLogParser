[00:11] <paultag> Ah, issue resolved, thank, czajkowski (etc!)
[00:15] <ajmitch> paultag: darn, did I miss the chance to own the team? :)
[00:15] <paultag> yep :)
[00:15] <paultag> at least edit it :)
[00:15] <paultag> I'm not sure what else :)
[00:15] <ajmitch> probably not a lot, really
[00:16] <ajmitch> you filed/found a bug about the token not being expired after use?
[00:16] <paultag> it's expired now, so someone fixed it
[00:16] <paultag> ajmitch: now i've got a better problem :)
[00:16] <ajmitch> yeah, but it could happen for other teams
[00:16] <paultag> aye
[00:16] <paultag> if oyu google search for the token url, oodles show up
[00:16] <paultag> and some were valid when I tested it
[00:17] <ajmitch> disturbing
[00:17] <paultag> ajmitch: bzr git import is now blowing up on git signed tags - I just re-made the branch, I'll get you logs in a skitch
[00:17] <ajmitch> I doubt I can help with that
[00:17] <wgrant> There's no way around that
[00:17] <paultag> :'(
[00:18] <paultag> Wellp, end-goal is recipies, so I s'pose I can bring back my dput-every-night-bot
[00:27] <washuu_de> dobey: Tnx. I wonder why all documentation links go to lauchpad. Ubuntu should separate user problems and bugs.
[00:27] <wgrant> washuu_de: Launchpad is a project hosting service that Ubuntu uses to track bugs, user questions, and other things
[00:28] <washuu_de> But... Is unsufficient or too-well-hidden documentation a launchpad matter? Or 'ubuntu?
[00:29] <washuu_de> I'm always sent to launchpad... That can't be right.
[00:29] <wgrant> Sent from where?
[00:30] <wgrant> Launchpad doesn't store Ubuntu documentation, but Ubuntu does use our support tracker (https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu)
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[00:30] <wgrant> But we're just a hosting service. The content is the reponsibility of the Ubuntu community
[00:35] <washuu_de> I can't document that right now. I usually click a link and "whoops" I'm in Lauchpad again.
[00:38] <washuu_de> wgrant: It is the links. But I can't pinpoint them right now. I'll look into my history (browser et al...) tomorrow. T'is sleeping time ,here.
[00:39] <washuu_de> tnx for your attention anyway

[02:54] <tao> hello
[02:54] <tao> Is there anybody online
[02:55] <tao> I have some questions on Linaro gcc's simd features
[03:02] <wgrant> tao: You probably want to ask in a Linaro channel
[03:03] <wgrant> This channel is for the Launchpad.net project hosting site
[03:07] <tao> yes. wgrant
[03:09] <tao> but I don't know how to find that channel
[03:10] <mwhudson> tao: #linaro is probably a good first guess :)

[16:20] <pinky> Hi! I received an email from launchpad saying "A new OAuth token consumer was enabled in Launchpad" and that if I didn't make the change I should contact someone on this channel
[16:20] <pinky> czajkowski: is that going to be you that I should contact?
[16:20] <czajkowski> pinky: yup
[16:21] <czajkowski> pinky: can you file a question on lp please with the details
[16:21] <czajkowski> https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+addquestion
[16:22] <pinky> czajkowski: sure can
[16:22] <czajkowski> cheers
[16:24] <pinky> czajkowski: #218958 if you are interested. thanks.
[16:27] <czajkowski> pinky: looking now
[16:27] <pinky> ta
[16:28] <czajkowski> pinky: doing anyting lately
[16:28] <czajkowski> adding new device for 2FA ?
[16:28] <czajkowski> adding U1 to a machine?
[16:28] <pinky> czajkowski: nope. new 2FA about a week ago
[16:28] <pinky> but that's it
[16:41] <czajkowski> pinky: resolved.
[16:51] <pinky> czajkowski: cool, thanks
[17:14] <mgz> czajkowski: perversely the same traceback as bug 884327
[17:14] <ubot5> bug 794353 in Bazaar "duplicate for #884327 ascii is a bad default filesystem encoding" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/794353
[17:14] <mgz> and ubot5 is smart, thanks ubot5
[17:15] <czajkowski> lol
[17:15] <mgz> so, the problem is that builder is using bzr 2.4.0
[17:15] <mgz> which doesn't have the fix for that issue
[17:19] <czajkowski> ah
[17:20] <mgz> I'm not sure how, if ever, we'll get the packages used on the builders updated
[17:20] <mgz> we've wanted the new bzr-builddeb on them forever so recipe v4 with all the nice new features would work
[17:20] <czajkowski> is this somewhere in a RT ?
[17:21] <mgz> I think so, but would need to poke jelmer to find out.
[17:21] <czajkowski> mgz: if you can find out and assign me the ticket I'l follow up with IS and see if I can make any headway on it
[17:21] <czajkowski> please
[17:23] <mgz> czajkowski: rt #46345
[17:24] <mgz> got bogged down because IS were making jelmer backport the entire universe to hardy
[17:24] <mgz> hopefully they have a less insane path for upgrade now
[17:24] <czajkowski> mgz: cheers
[17:25] <czajkowski> ah it's one of them RTS
[17:25] <czajkowski> I need to ope and come back to it later once it's loaded
[17:25] <mgz> (universe as in hyperbole, not as in the repository universe)
[17:25] <czajkowski> lordie
[17:31]  * maxb would make some sort of snide comment, except for still running quite a few Debian etch servers. glass houses, stones...
[17:31] <maxb> Backporting python2.7 to etch was amusing

[21:27] <tgs3> hello. why would username of user https://launchpad.net/~opensource-m3  not match the name visible in the url after ~ ?
[21:30] <mapreri> tgs3: Which proof do you have to say this?
[21:38] <czajkowski> tgs3: display name is different from the LP id
[22:50] <tgs3> czajkowski: well in short, how to set own ~name ?
[22:50] <tgs3> LP id is the part in url after ~ ?
[22:57] <dobey> typically you choose your username when you create an account
