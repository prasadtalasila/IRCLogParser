[15:07] <dpm> hi all, could someone give this app developer a hand? http://askubuntu.com/questions/235613/what-is-the-best-practice-for-saving-data-in-ubuntu-one-db-from-mobile
[15:07] <ralsina> dpm: aquarius was going to answer that
[15:08] <dpm> nice, thanks!
[15:08] <aquarius> dpm, ya, I'm on it :0
[15:08] <ralsina> dpm: you're welcome!
[15:14] <aquarius> dpm, ralsina, answered.
[15:16] <dpm> awesome, thanks aquarius!
[15:19] <dpm> aquarius, where does your qtquick quickly template live? http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1495570/
[15:20] <aquarius> dpm, in /home/aquarius/quickly-templates ;)
[15:21] <dpm> hahaha, I was fearing that answer
[15:21] <aquarius> dpm, it's not published because it's a horrible hacky thing that I'm not sure is right, and I only got about halfway through dealing with it before I got caught up with other stuff
[15:21] <aquarius> dpm, so this isn't a working project
[15:21] <dpm> no worries, I was just curious to see your QML notes app
[15:21] <aquarius> dpm, it's there so people can see how the QML+U1DB stuff works
[15:21] <aquarius> at the moment :)
[15:22] <aquarius> you can probably just poke .quickly to tell it it's using the non -sil template and it'll be OK
[15:22] <aquarius> I don't think I changed much
[15:22] <aquarius> that's exactly what I was working on when I dropped it before Christmas, and I haven't had time to go back
[15:42] <dpm> aquarius, yeah, I could also run it directly from bin/u1notes. It looks pretty awesome, I like the fliping to see the formatted text, nice work!
[15:43] <aquarius> dpm, cool :)
[15:43] <aquarius> dpm, it was really for me to experiment with (a) u1db in QML, and (b) making an app look cool with qml ;)
[15:45] <dpm> aquarius, yeah, I've been playing a bit with QML lately too and it's pretty awesome. How are the PySide bindings, are they nice to code with, or did you have any issues with them?
[15:45] <aquarius> no issues :)
[15:45] <aquarius> although I don't *do* much in Python -- the whole app is basically in QML ;)
[15:46] <dpm> ah, yeah, I haven't looked much at the code yet, I just noticed you were using PySide
[15:46] <aquarius> this is why I am resentful about how almost all my app is in one file, the qml file, and yet I need 92,000 other files that quickly provides which I don't care about and which don't work ;-)
[15:46] <aquarius> but that's annoying whinging which I'm not prepared to do anything to fix, so I should shut up

[17:00] <nrosvall_> for the phone os, are there any plans to support python with pyside or pyqt?
[17:14] <ralsina> nrosvall_: wrong channel :-)
[17:14] <ralsina> nrosvall_: you probably want to ask in #ubuntu
[17:21] <nrosvall_> oh sorry!
[17:21] <nrosvall_> I though i was typing to #ubuntuphone
[17:21] <ralsina> nrosvall_: no problem :-)
