[01:01] <infinity> hallyn: Can you try that with 3.8?
[01:01] <infinity> hallyn: (or try mounting something inside that isn't a tmpfs)
[01:02] <infinity> hallyn: In the current 3.7 in the archive, there's a tmpfs leak that could be, perhaps, not helping here.
[01:35] <hallyn> infinity: we confirmed with http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~rtg/Ubuntu-3.8.0-0.1/
[01:35] <hallyn> can't do an upstream tree as we need overlayfs
[01:36] <hallyn> it shouldn't be tmpfs since you don't have to mount a tmpfs to trigger it
[01:41] <infinity> hallyn: Okay, I just saw your script used a tmpfs.  But if it's still there in 3.8, it's not the bug I was thinking of anyway.
[02:02] <hallyn> infinity: yeah there are commented lines in the script which can be used as an alternate to the tmpfs mount - which mount devpts.  i added tmpfs bc stgraber asked if devpts might be the trigger :)  (it's not)
[02:05] <MikeMin> Did anyone have any luck with http://rankone.us?
[04:29] <infinity> apw: When you wake up, we need a new linux-signed to match the current linux (in raring).
[05:00] <infinity> apw: Nevermind, tim got to it.

[10:04] <henrix> are you guys fine with that?
[10:06] <cking> henrix, can I stall on this for 20 mins while I answer an email concerning this fix
[10:06] <henrix> cking: sure :)
[10:43] <cking> henrix, i'm fine with it, apw, any thoughts? ^^
[10:44] <apw> yeah it is very very unlikely to cause problems and if it does it means you don't keys keys or something for a small number of machines
[10:44] <apw> and the potential upside, our CDs are safer, seems worth that risk to me
[10:48] <henrix> apw: cking: ack, thanks
[10:48] <henrix> i'll add a comment to the bug and proceed to testing
[10:48] <cking> henrix, apw explained it very succinctly 
[10:49] <henrix> yep, i'll write that down on the comment :)
[10:49] <henrix> thanks

[11:30] <smb> apw, did I not see you talk about this recently...? That we have some event there not upstream
[11:31] <apw> jodh, yes we have a patch for those trace points
[11:31] <jodh> apw: ok, thanks. I've updated the bug, but sounds like someone may have to bisect our patchset then.
[11:31] <apw> jodh, i am told actually there are now generic syscall ones
[11:32] <apw> jodh, wich are hinted at in our patch
[11:32] <jodh> apw: if you can send me some details, I'll take a look, but currently ureadahead is broken on seemingly everything but armhf
[11:35] <apw> jodh, i'll poke it first, it could well be the patch is no longer working
[11:37] <apw> it is about time someone knew how this worked again

[11:43] <apw> jodh, yep have the same in mine,
[11:49] <cking> didn't the tracing output change in 3.7-3.8 
[13:00] <ogasawara> henrix: hi, when is the 3.2.0-36 kernel in precise-proposed getting promoted to -updates?  today?
[13:03] <ogasawara> henrix: oh wait, or is this the one we're letting this one bake an extra 3 weeks for the point release
[13:08] <herton> ogasawara, it still has next week for testing on the schedule, waiting on security-signoff/certification-testing right now. I believe will be promoted some time next week
[13:09] <herton> ogasawara, indeed, from what I remember this will be the one for the point release, not sure if it will be on hold or not
[13:10] <ogasawara> herton: ok thanks.  I assumed we'd still promote it to -updates, we just wouldn't turn the crank on a new cycle.
[13:11] <ogasawara> bjf: is my assumption correct ^^
[13:11] <herton> ogasawara, yes that's correct
[13:11] <ogasawara> herton: perfect, thanks
[13:21]  * henrix -> lunch
[13:31] <apw> jodh, ok this is part kernel, part ureadahead issues, am testing the fixes now
[13:45] <jodh> apw: thanks - sounds intriguing :)
[13:48] <apw> jodh, deprecation of an interface we are using for ureadahead and change of type affecting the interfaces for open in the kernel
[13:48] <apw> i'll get some patches out shortly
[13:51] <jodh> apw: thanks. I wonder how are we going to stop this sort of thing happening in the future though? Is there a list of deprecated interfaces that we could grep the archive for say?
[13:52] <ogra_> one good step would be more detailed error msgs in ureadahead
[13:53] <ogra_> it took me half a day to find the issue on the nx7 ... if it woulld have told me "cant open /sys/foo/bar" that would have been easier than having "exited with startus 5"
[13:53] <jodh> yeah, I think that + mountall could do with some 'nose-cone polishing'. I've written a crude DEP-8 test for ureadahead that would detect the bug we're discussing, but if we can catch incorrect syscall usage before apps hit the archive, all the better ;)
[13:54] <ogra_> ++ indeed
[13:54] <jodh> ogra_: strace :)
[13:54] <ogra_> yeah, thats what i resorted to indeed
[14:04] <sforshee> apw, what was the bug you were seeing with the wl driver?

[16:13] <apw> ogasawara, rtg, have anything in the pipeline for raring ?

[16:34] <tseliot> apw: hmm... let me check
[16:38] <tseliot> apw: did it use to work?
[16:38] <apw> tseliot, i doubt i had ipv6 when i first switched away from wl
[16:39] <apw> tseliot, and generally i use brcmsmac to give it some testing

[16:40] <tseliot> apw: does it help if you do something like this? System Settings -> Network ->  Wireless -> [select your network(s)] -> Options... -> IPv6  Settings -> Method: Ignore
[16:41] <apw> tseliot, if i rmmod wl and modprobe brcmsmac it works fine, so i assume system level is configured
[16:41] <apw> correctly
[16:42] <tseliot> apw: what happens if you reinstall the previous upstream release?
[16:42] <apw> it doesn't work with v3.8 right ?
[16:42] <herton> hggdh, done
[16:43] <hggdh> herton: thank you
[16:43] <henrix> hggdh: sorry, i should have done that 2 days ago...
[16:44] <hggdh> herton: no prob, I just wanted to be sure I was Doing The Right Thing ;-)
[16:44] <tseliot> apw: right, I didn't port that driver to 3.8. Wait does 3.7 make any difference with this issue?
[16:44] <apw> tseliot, dunno to be honest
[16:45] <apw> tseliot, ask me in the bug to remind me, i've rebooted this latop 10 times today for other kernel issues, and frankly i cannot cope with rebooting again today
[16:45] <hggdh> apw: for the record, bcmwl V5 only works with 3.7 up to, and including, 3.7.0-5
