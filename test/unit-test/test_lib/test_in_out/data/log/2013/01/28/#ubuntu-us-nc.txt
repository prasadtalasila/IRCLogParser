[13:21] <holstein> coxn: i usually go with whatever is at the goodwill
[13:21] <holstein> something on the quiet side
[13:21] <holstein> OR, something i can take some fans out of and not lose any sleep over it if it gets hot and dies
[13:22] <Nivex> for my parents' media PC I got a Shuttle barebones kit from Newegg and added the requisite parts
[13:22] <Nivex> using an SSD, the only thing making noise are the two fans in the case
[13:40] <holstein> i like the barebones or prebuilts for that
[13:40] <holstein> seems like they have quieter setups
[13:40] <holstein> better fan speed managment or something
[13:40] <holstein> when i just build one, they tend to be loud
