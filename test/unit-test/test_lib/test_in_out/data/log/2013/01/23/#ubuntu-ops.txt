[03:04] <phix> hey, can I join #ubuntu yet?
[03:13] <elky> no.
[03:15] <IdleOne> agreed.
[03:16] <IdleOne> phix: Please part this channel now.
[03:17] <phix> oh, why not? it has been a few months
[03:17] <IdleOne> Truthfully, we don't want to.
[03:18] <IdleOne> remove the ban and allow you back in #ubuntu that is
[03:18] <phix> hmmmm, it wouldn't require that much effort to type the command in
[03:18] <IdleOne> true.
[03:18] <IdleOne> Doesn't change the fact that we won't.
[03:18] <phix> I am sure you are a fast typer too
[03:18] <phix> I'll time you IdleOne :)
[03:19] <IdleOne> phix: Please part the channel.
[03:19] <phix> yeah ok
[03:19] <phix> see you later
[03:19] <IdleOne> later
[04:46] <ubottu> cfhowlett called the ops in #ubuntu (selite,)
[10:30] <IdleOne> ikonia: you understand the tech part of his trolling way better than me. I'll leave you to it :)
[10:38] <ikonia> it seems to have shut him up now, so it works
[13:06] <ikonia> MEGASHAREUPLOAD...this won't end well
[14:10] <ubottu> FloodBot1 called the ops in #ubuntu-ops-monitor (repeated abuse from ikonia)
[14:10] <Pici> heh
[14:11] <ikonia> ;)
[14:48] <Pici> Is avis always random and unintelligable?
[14:48] <ikonia> from memory yes
[14:51] <IdleOne> pretty much
[14:52] <ikonia> another quality contributor
[14:52] <IdleOne> random but he does manage to string more than 3 words together that /could/ make sense with context.
[14:53] <IdleOne> least he doesn't flood #ubuntu like some :P
[19:41] <Pici> thanks h00k
[19:42] <h00k> :( I was a bit late
[19:43] <h00k> DJones: beat me to the draw
[19:43] <DJones> I could see the way the conversation was going, already had it typed ready to go
[22:36] <Myrtti> !away > Noskcaj_afk
