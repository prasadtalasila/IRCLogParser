[15:47] <maxb> Hi. Can anyone suggest a likely package to file a bug about quantal dropping the resolution of a monitor output if the monitor is temporarily disconnected for a few minutes (by a KVM switch) ?
[16:40] <roadmr> maxb: xorg maybe?
[16:41] <maxb> Might we worth a try :-)
[16:41] <roadmr> maxb: it's a starting point, and it will collect useful x-related information, if a triager feels it's misclassified he will just reassign to the correct package
[16:41] <roadmr> maxb: so as long as your report is in the ballpark (i.e. don't file it on transmission or gedit) you should be fine
