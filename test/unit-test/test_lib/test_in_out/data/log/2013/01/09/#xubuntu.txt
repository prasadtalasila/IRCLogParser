[00:04] <dcope> Hey all
[00:04] <dcope> anyone running xubuntu on a macbook? i just installed 12.04 and the apple doesn't turn off when i shut the lid. any fix?
[00:05] <dcope> it works when i do suspend -> close lid
[00:30] <nimo> can you uninstall pulse?   and still get audio?
[00:36] <David-A> nimo: to some degree yes. (In 10.04 I have uninstalled pulseaudio, pulseaudio-esound-compat, pulseaudio-module-x11,  gstreamer0.10-pulseaudio, libpulse-browse0, libpulse-mainloop-glib0)
[00:42] <nimo> David-A,   in my understanding pulse lays ontop of ALSA.. and ALSA is sufficient for the everday user... is that correct?
[00:49] <David-A> nimo: for some people that is probably how it is.
[00:58] <David-A> every new audio system tries to replace the others being on top of the others. there are thousands of them. this is from before pulse: http://matt.bottrell.com.au/uploads/Pics/linuxaudio.png
[00:59] <David-A> (sorry, that was after pulse, not before)
[01:41] <HonestAbe> howdy folks! how do I assign a keystroke to workspace switching in 12.10? in previous versions, all that was necessary was going to the shortcuts menu and assigning the approprate keystrokes
[01:42] <HonestAbe> now it appears that the workspace switching is not included by default in the shortcut key menu. If someone could just provide some sort of a helpful link with the appropriate commands to bind, that would be absolutely delightful
[01:50] <Zelouille> HonestAbe: there are two places for settings keystrokes. Workspace keystrokes are in the Window Manager settings.
[01:51] <HonestAbe> checking before i say thanks
[01:51] <HonestAbe> you magnificent bastard, thank you
[01:56] <Zelouille> HonestAbe: That's part of the odd things on GNU/Linux. Like setting a theme for the windows, and another one for the window-borders. Because each part is an independent piece of software. Well, that's how I understand it.
[01:57] <HonestAbe> It certainly is bizarre. I'll have to keep it in mind, all of those weird things are so useful to remember.
[02:22] <hasn-tmp> hello. Running the 12.10 livecd now, and I'm observing strange behavior with the panel and window buttons plugin...
[02:23] <hasn-tmp> it seems to cause a 1-pixel shift in the panel when moving from workspaces containing windows to empty workspaces, but only with the plugin handle hidden
[02:35] <Zelouille> hasn-tmp: you are right. I experience the same thing on the livecd. I can't test on an installed system. You may want to post a bug report on https://bugzilla.xfce.org
[02:48] <hasn-tmp> ah,  it has already been reported: https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8953
[02:48] <ubottu> bugzilla.xfce.org bug 8953 in Workspace Switcher "1 pixel offset when the workspace switcher shows an empty workspace" [Minor,New]
[02:55] <rk0n> Does anyone know how to get the panel to keep the clock all the way to the right of the panel?
[02:55] <rk0n> I removed some things from the panel and now it moves depending on how many windows I have open
[02:56] <rk0n> I want it to keep certain things (clock, tray) to the right, and the app menu to the left
[02:57] <hasn-tmp> add a "Separator" to the panel and set it to expand
[02:57] <rk0n> Ah, awesome! Thank you!
[03:17] <Zelouille> hasn-tmp: maybe you should add a comment to the bug, to say that's not the "workspace switcher" component which is faulty (like said in the bug report), but the "window buttons". There's nothing to do with workspace in fact. Only the window button that doesn't take the same width when it's empty (with handle hidden).
[03:21] <Zelouille> rk0n: this is how "window buttons" works since xfce 4.10. There's a line on the Xubuntu 12.10 FAQ about this.
[03:22] <rk0n> Zelouille: Thank you, I didn't know
[05:14] <xubuntu104> i am trying to install xubuntu 12.10 along side windows 7, but xubuntu keeps telling me that there is no other OS installed?
[05:14] <xubuntu104> any thoughts
[06:15] <xubuntu128> hi! i unstall xubuntu on hard disk which i don't want and now i want to formatting (deleting all files) my 2 hard disks (in one of them windows is working). How I can do this?

[09:44] <WalterN> so I set up a PXE server, but when I go to boot the PXE, it says that it failed
[09:46] <WalterN> not sure whats wrong exactly
[09:47] <WalterN> the tftpd-hpa service seems fine (at least it does not complain when I restart it)
[09:54] <koegs> WalterN: any error messages or at least config-files?
[09:55] <WalterN> koegs: where would such an error message be?
[09:56] <WalterN> on my dd-wrt router, I just have dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0,xubuntu,192.168.1.10
[09:56] <WalterN> http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/PXE
[09:56] <WalterN> and http://pastebin.com/pmbwUiUh
[09:57] <WalterN> for /etc/default/tftpd-hpa
[09:57] <koegs> and your pxelinux.cfg?
[09:58] <WalterN> with the Xubuntu netboot.tar.gz unpackaged in..
[09:58] <WalterN> where is that file?
[09:58] <WalterN> XD
[09:58] <WalterN> oh, folder
[09:58] <koegs> in you /var/lib/tftpboot
[09:58] <koegs> it should be /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default
[09:59] <WalterN> whatever came with the netboot.tar.gz ... sec
[09:59] <WalterN> http://pastebin.com/pCqEHdG8
[10:00] <koegs> and these files do exist within /var/lib/tftpboot?
[10:00] <WalterN> looking
[10:00] <WalterN> menu.cfg does, and..
[10:01] <WalterN> the other one does too
[10:03] <koegs> then i would check the syslog and the error messages on your PXE-Client
[10:05] <WalterN> hmm
[10:05] <WalterN> Jan  9 02:33:34 luna in.tftpd[29245]: tftp: client does not accept options
[10:06] <WalterN> what does that mean?
[10:06] <koegs> please try TFTP_OPTIONS="-l -s" instead of "--secure"
[10:07] <WalterN> restarting the service..
[10:07] <WalterN> lets try booting
[10:08] <WalterN> same error messages on the client and server
[10:10] <WalterN> is it because my laptop (the computer I'm trying to PXE boot from) does not support something that it should for a PXE boot?
[10:16] <WalterN> hmm, that looks like its a pretty generic error message for PXE booting
[10:18] <koegs> WalterN: how did you put the netboot.tar.gz on your server and how did you unpack the files?
[10:19] <WalterN> sudo wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz
[10:19] <WalterN> sudo tar -zxvf netboot.tar.gz
[10:19] <koegs> hm, looking good
[10:20] <WalterN> did this once before not too long ago with debian... *shrug*
[10:20] <WalterN> I just removed the debian stuff from that folder and obtained the ubuntu netboot tarball
[10:21] <WalterN> and made sure they were at least readable with chmod
[10:21] <koegs> got no idea right now
[10:22] <WalterN> I wonder if its an issue with how PXE is implemented on the laptop
[10:22] <WalterN> dont have a cd/dvd drive in it, so I cant install Xubuntu that way XD
[10:23] <koegs> WalterN: USB?
[10:23] <WalterN> could do a USB thumb drive install I suppose
[10:23] <WalterN> but "meh, why bother when I have PXE sitting here"
[10:23] <koegs> if it works :P
[10:24] <WalterN> what was the TFTP_OPTIONS="-l -s" supposed to do in place of --secure?
[10:25] <koegs> dunno, it is from my working setup :D
[10:25] <WalterN> oh heh
[10:25] <WalterN> --secure worked for me before, with the debian thing
[10:25] <koegs> i have -l -s on my arm-debian
[10:26] <koegs> maybe it does not matter
[10:27] <WalterN> I'll check BIOS settings, see if I'm missing something in there

[10:32] <WalterN> koegs: that guy said the pxelinux.0 file was not correct or something
[10:33] <koegs> WalterN: it should be a link
[10:33] <koegs> pxelinux.0 -> ubuntu-installer/i386/pxelinux.0
[10:33] <WalterN> mine is 26.5kB in size
[10:33] <koegs> or amd64 in your case
[10:33] <WalterN> oh
[10:34] <WalterN> looks like it does, and seems to be good?
[10:35] <koegs> i do not use the netboot-packages, i boot complete live-sessions via NFS
[10:35] <WalterN> oh, from the ISO?
[10:35] <WalterN> cause that would be nice
[10:37] <koegs> you have to unpack the ISO or loop-mount it
[10:42] <yolateng0> quit
[11:22] <nantou> i have found 4 defective blocks running sudo badblocks -sv /dev/sda. How bad is it? how do I fix it?

[16:23] <jackherer1> Hello, I just installed gparted but I can't find it anywhere. How can I run it?
[16:31] <Yotson> jackherer1: here a link to start gparted lives in Applications menu -> System -> GParted
[16:33] <jackherer1> It is not there
[16:33] <jackherer1> I can't find it anywhere in applications menu
[16:34] <Yotson> other option could be to start it from a terminal. "sudo gparted"
[16:35] <jackherer1> thx
[16:36] <Yotson> np.
[16:39] <laite> jackherer1: IIRC gparted goes on 'settings manager' nowdays

[17:18] <xubuntu537> hello? anybody online?
[17:19] <raytray> xubuntu537, sup
[17:20] <xubuntu537> I just loaded a new version of xunbuntu. Most new programs that I install do not appear in the menus? Can you help?
[17:22] <xubuntu537> I was installing Partition editor software, different versions, and most do not show up on the menus or elswhere. This, even though they show that they are installed.
[17:23] <xubuntu537> Version 12.04 is what I am using.
[17:29] <xubuntu537> Where would the programs load, typically, maybe then I could just type the program in the terminal mode.
[17:29] <baizon> xubuntu537: enable it using menu editor (alacarte)
[17:31] <xubuntu537> menu editor is in administration or which submenu?
[17:34] <xubuntu537> The Menu editor that is in the control center? enable the install there?
[17:36] <baizon> xubuntu537: just launch alacarte _)
[17:36] <baizon> :)
[17:37] <xubuntu537> If I understand you. The programs are installed but maynot be enabled? Right? I need to enter in to the Menu editor an then enable the software that should exist. IS this a progrmmers mistake or error? Or is this normal for all programs? 'Gparted' enabled itself when I loaded the software.
[17:41] <xubuntu537> I will need to leave but I will be back. I need to reload my OS. xubuntu537 out for a minute.
[17:55] <xubuntu538> Hell. I am now back online and I am inquiring about my new installs. I was unable to find the new installs on my menus. I was asked to go into 'alacarte' and enable them. I have not found this software, yet. Can you assist?
[17:55] <baizon> xubuntu538: what did you install?
[17:56] <xubuntu538> Where is Alacarte?
[17:56] <koegs> xubuntu538: how do you install the software?
[17:56] <baizon> xubuntu538: type alt+F2 then type alacarte
[17:56] <koegs> baizon: :P
[17:56] <baizon> koegs:
[17:59] <xubuntu538> I view the software from the Ubuntu Software Center. And then I select the software that I would like to install. Partition software for the Harddrive is what I was installing. I install ed many versions of software, even 'Gparted'. I discovered that only, 'Gparted ' was showing on the menus. I installed Xubuntu ver. 12.04.
[18:00] <xubuntu538> I am a new user of your Xubuntu software and Linux user.
[18:03] <xubuntu538> Can anybody help out in telling me where alacarte is?
[18:04] <baizon> xubuntu538: type alt+F2 then type alacarte
[18:08] <xubuntu538> OK. I did type ALT F2 and then typed alacarte. Up came the menu editer allowing me to enable menu items. The sofwtare pacjages that I installed are not listed, except for ,Gparted,. Is it possible the software would install but not get listed in alacarte?
[18:09] <baizon> xubuntu538: you sure the software is installed?
[18:09] <baizon> alt+F2 and "gparted". If it works you got it installed
=== torminator is now known as Guest69611
[18:11] <xubuntu538> Well, tahnks for asking. I go to the Software Center and attempt to install the software again and find that the software Center says the software is already installed. So  this tells me the software did get installed but is not showing in the menu.
[18:12] <koegs> which one?
[18:16] <drc> xubuntu538: What apps did you install that are <not> showing up; and (from your nick) was this on an installed xubuntu or the live cd (not sure if it makes a difference).  And what version of xubuntu is this.  And what happens is you try looking at the menu thru Main Menu?
[18:17] <xubuntu538> OK. 'partition' search for partition 'partclone'. This allows for a user to clone a partition. Exciting software to me but not everybody else. The software does not allow for me to install bt only remove the software. This indicates that the software was installed. In fact I installe the software last night. But it is not listed in the alacarte menu editor.
[18:18] <xubuntu538> Xubuntu ver 12.04
[18:20] <koegs> xubuntu538: obviously partclone is only a terminal-program
[18:21] <xubuntu538> Are terminal programs only runable from the terminal? Or can I insert a routine to run the program from the menu?
[18:22] <drc> xubuntu538: Was this app listed in the menu after you installed it last night?
[18:22] <xubuntu538> This maybe a dumb question. How can I tell that the program is a terminal program.
[18:22] <koegs> xubuntu538: most of them would need parameters, so it is better to open up a terminal
[18:23] <xubuntu538> Or terminal progam only.
[18:23] <drc> xubuntu538: some terminal apps can be run from the menu (htop is an example) but most don't
[18:24] <drc> xubuntu538: And <you> can use alacarte/main-menu to set up a menu item for those that don't
[18:24] <xubuntu538> The item was not listed in the menu list, 'alacarte'. Even after I rebooted the OS.
[18:25] <drc> xubuntu538: was this on an installed system or a live cd?
[18:26] <xubuntu538> This was an installed system, running on a Gateway M285-E Laptop with 100 Gig HD.
[18:27] <xubuntu538> This uses an Centrino Duo procesor.
[18:29] <Zelouille> xubuntu538: on xubuntu 12.04, sometime I have to refresh the menu, to see new installed applications. I do that by right-click on the xfce menu button > properties > then i choose a "custom menu file", then switch back to the default one.
[18:33] <drc> xubuntu538: I agrre with koegs, this looks like a terminal app, so...unless you use this app quite often (enough to justify the effort to make a menu item), I'd just use the terminal.
[18:36] <xubuntu538> If it is a teminal application where do I look for the program to manually insert into the menu tree?
[18:40] <baizon> xubuntu538: yes, alacarte can do this
[18:40] <drc> I start easyL  open a terminal, type the name of the app (partclone>) and see if it's in your path...if it runs from there than all you need to do is type the name of the app when you make the menu item.
[18:41] <drc> If not, I'd look in the /usr tree../ysr/bin. /usr/local/bin...something like that.
[18:42] <drc> Dog walking time...back later.
[18:42] <xubuntu538> OK Zelouille i proceeded as you suggested. The 'partclone' program and others still did not show up. what do you suggest?
[18:45] <koegs> xubuntu538: partclone will not show up... never, you have to use the terminal or add it manually
[18:48] <Zelouille> xubuntu538: you can add it manually, like koegs said.
[18:49] <xubuntu538> OK. I opened the terminal package and 'partclone' is what I typed and 'command not found' error cameup. I do not have a path to the dircetory where the software was installed. Suggestions on where the program would be?
[18:52] <koegs> xubuntu538: if you look at the details of partclone in the software center, it will tell you the commands
[18:52] <koegs> also you can try partclone<tab>
[18:53] <Zelouille> xubuntu538: try typing "partclone" on the terminal, then pressing "Tab" two times... It will suggest you all the partclone utilities.
[18:54] <xubuntu538> Then run a search for the individual file and consequently find the path that way. OK I am still learning the Linux way as opposed to the Gates way.
[18:56] <Zelouille> xubuntu538: try "man partclone" too, to see the manual.
[18:58] <xubuntu538> The 'man partclone' command exhibited a 'No manual entry for partclone'. Suggestion?
[19:00] <ChrisWere> Hey guys, does anyone know how to get the spell check working in libre office on xubuntu?
[19:00] <Ronalds_M> anybody knows if FX 5200 supports newest nvidia driver, or how to overclock it on linux?
[19:01] <xubuntu538> OK Zeuille, I did as you suggest with using the tab button. And multiple items, variations of 'prtaclone' were shown. Is this  listing all the programs of this type?
[19:03] <Ronalds_M> ChrisWere, there is no option in menu?
[19:03] <ChrisWere> Ronalds_M: yes, it's just it doesn't work, it doesn't seem to pick up a dictionary even though I have them installed.
[19:03] <Ronalds_M> maybe some package is missing from libre office, try synaptic
[19:04] <Ronalds_M> it works in unity
[19:04] <Ronalds_M> or you don't have unity?
[19:04] <ChrisWere> Ronalds_M: I've tried installing every conceivable package. I'm on XFCE, hense why I'm in #Xubuntu
[19:04] <Ronalds_M> ah, yes
[19:05] <Ronalds_M> I don't use libre office on my xubuntu so I don't know
[19:06] <ChrisWere> Ronalds_M: I get so many more bugs in my Linux system than on my windows. I hate windows so, but I spend most of my time working out these kind of bugs.
[19:08] <Ronalds_M> linux works out of the box as desktop OS , if you have enough resources
[19:08] <Ronalds_M> maybe you should try ubuntu standart, if you can run it
[19:08] <Ronalds_M> cause it beats tha shit out of windows 7 and xp in terms of awesomeness
[19:08] <ChrisWere> Ronald_M: I have a pretty fast computer. I don;t think that's what's causing this spell check error
[19:09] <superboot> Hi all. I've got a wacom bamboo gth-670 tablet. It works on my i386 laptop (xubuntu 12.04), and not on my x64 desktop. Both are stock systems.
[19:09] <Ronalds_M> there is always an option to install more window managers
[19:10] <ChrisWere> Ronalds_M: Linux is much better but I just run into so many bugs and regressions, it's very frustrating and I spend too much time fixing them.
[19:10] <xubuntu538> OK everybody. Thanks for your help and input. I am a long tme user of windows. I am very interested in Linux and varieties of Linux. Thanks I will learn more and come back online.
[19:10] <Ronalds_M> bugs in libre office means
[19:10] <Ronalds_M> you have to take other version
[19:10] <Ronalds_M> latest are not always the stable ones
[19:11] <Ronalds_M> nobody knows how to overclock gpu with linux?
[19:13] <baizon> Ronalds_M: what GPU Vendor?
[19:13] <Ronalds_M> nvidia FX 5200
[19:14] <baizon> Ronalds_M: http://www.headshotgamer.com/gamepics/102_OpenSUSE_OverclockNvidia4.png
[19:14] <baizon> do you have this?
[19:14] <Ronalds_M> well I have standart driver
[19:15] <Ronalds_M> I tried installing overclock app it doesn't starts
[19:15] <baizon> Ronalds_M: i dont think it will work with the OS-drivers
[19:15] <Ronalds_M> version 173
[19:15] <Ronalds_M> driver version I have
[19:15] <baizon> Ronalds_M: try this http://www.upubuntu.com/2011/09/how-to-overclock-nvidia-graphics-cards.html
[19:16] <superboot> Ronalds_M: Don't use the Return key for punctuation. Don't be afraid of long lines.
[19:32] <Ronalds_M> I'm back
[19:32] <Ronalds_M> pls
[19:32] <Ronalds_M> post that link again
[19:32] <Ronalds_M> I lost system because of changing that file
