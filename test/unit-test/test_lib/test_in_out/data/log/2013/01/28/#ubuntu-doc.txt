[19:29] <YoBoY> hi
[19:30] <YoBoY> stupid question: why the po files of the precise ubuntu server guide are not updated ?
[19:42] <jbicha> YoBoY: since the server guide is not distributed as an Ubuntu package but just on help.ubuntu.com, we don't really post the translated version
[19:43] <jbicha> someone needs to set it up like the desktop guide online and then there will be a point to translating it
[19:44] <YoBoY> it is already being translatedâ€¦ the quantal version have the po files up to date
[19:44] <YoBoY> and some crazy locoteams put it online too http://guide.ubuntu-fr.org/server/
[19:54] <jbicha> could you send another email to the list?
[19:55] <YoBoY> Perhaps it's better to open a bug on the project
[19:55] <YoBoY> ?
[19:56] <jbicha> sure you could do that too, personally I think I'd see a mailing list post easier (I'm subscribed to too much LP bug email)
[19:57] <YoBoY> I can do both ^^
[19:57] <YoBoY> Do I have to register to the ML to post on it ?
[20:09] <YoBoY> done and done :)
[20:33] <jbicha> yes if you want to skip the moderation queue
[20:39] <YoBoY> already too much suscribed mailing lists :] I've taken the moderation queue option :)
