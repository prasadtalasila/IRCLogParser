[15:14] <Controlsfreek> I'm new to this, but I'm looking at https://bugs.launchpad.net/~unity-community-hackers/+bugs. Are all these bugs related to Ubuntu+1? How do i know which release I need to be testing in? Thanks for the newbie help!
[15:21] <mhall119> Controlsfreek: you can ignore the unity-2d bugs, since that codebase isn't maintained anymore
[15:22] <mhall119> unless specified otherwise, those bugs would affect current and +1 releases
[15:22] <Controlsfreek> mhall119, Oh good to know. I was just going off of that web page as a place to start. Is there a better place to start?
[15:22] <Controlsfreek> Also the mailing list link at https://launchpad.net/~unity-community-hackers seems to be dead. Looking for the correct place to join the mailing list
[15:22] <mhall119> https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity has all the unity bugs
[15:23] <Controlsfreek> mhall119, I'm running 12.10. Should I upgrade to +1 before starting/
[15:23] <mhall119> it would be more useful, yeah
[15:24] <mhall119> plus, 13.04 is really nice :)
[15:24] <Controlsfreek> okay great. thanks!
[19:40] <Controlsfreek> I'm trying to build Unity for the first time. I've built nux successfully. Still getting errors: http://pastebin.com/1dnHXwk7
[19:42] <Controlsfreek> For some reason it gives "--   package 'nux-4.0>=4.0.0' not found" but then later on it says "--   found nux-4.0, version 4.0.0" I'm a bit confused
[20:41] <tgm4883> Controlsfreek, that is an unknown paste ID
[20:42] <tgm4883> not that I'll know the answer, but it makes it difficult to look
