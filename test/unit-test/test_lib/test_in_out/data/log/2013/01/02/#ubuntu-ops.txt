[16:01] <Pici> Meh, I'm not sure how I feel about this "pay for ubuntu" thing thats in the new download page.
[16:02] <bazhang> it stinks
[16:02] <Pici> I don't even see a link on there that actually says where the money is going.
[16:03] <Pici> Does it go to the Ubuntu Foundation? Canonical? Shuttlerworth's jet fuel fund?
[16:05] <DJones> Looking at website now, I don't even see any "donate" button
[16:05] <DJones> Not until you get to about the 4th link into the get ubuntu options
[16:06] <DJones> Its not as if you're forced to give credit card details before you download
[16:08] <Pici> Actually, it comes up right after you press the "get Ubuntu" buttons under the architecture selector.
[16:09] <k1l> i think its a good idea but they could have done it more properly. like the amazon-search thingy
[16:10] <k1l> but it doesnt deserve the shitstorm its recieving.
[16:10] <DJones> Right, just looking now, 3rd click before I actually get asked to contribute and even then, the contribute & just download buttons are pretty much next to each other

[18:29] <h00k> where do we put ubuntu phone discussions?
[18:29] <IdleOne> #ubuntu-discuss
[18:30] <ikonia> maybe....#ubuntu-phone
[18:30] <ikonia> it's been useless for long enough
[18:30] <ikonia> now it may have an actual use
[18:32] <IdleOne> ikonia: it isn't a phone yet and we should be flooding a channel where there may be people who actually contribute with all the flame
[18:32] <IdleOne> should'nt*
[18:37] <ikonia> it isn't a phone ?
[18:37] <ikonia> I thought they had just announced a phone
[18:37] <Myrtti> available in early 2014
[18:38] <ikonia> so ?
[18:38] <AlanBell> they have announced the potential for there to be a phone
[18:38] <ikonia> phone discussion
[18:38] <ikonia> we point people at #ubuntu-tv for a product that doesn't exist
