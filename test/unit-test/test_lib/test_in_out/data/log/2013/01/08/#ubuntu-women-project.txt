[18:10] <Deindre> hi IdleOne :)
[18:10] <IdleOne> hello :)
[18:12] <Deindre> so, let's going on :)
[18:12] <Deindre>  we don't have a whole lot on the agenda
[18:13] <Deindre> but me and Dolasilla have enough to say
[18:13] <Deindre> first of all I'd like to point the situation of Ubuntu Women competition
[18:15]  * akk is sorta here too
[18:15] <Deindre> I wished to ask Pendulum if she had some new about it
[18:15] <Deindre> hi akk, you're welcome :)
[18:15] <Deindre> Pendulum: are you here?
[18:16] <Deindre> neverthless pleia2 asked me to say that she'll be sending out a coordination email this week,
[18:16] <Deindre> and, of course  new ideas are welcome during the meeting
[18:16] <Deindre> so, ideas? purposes?
[18:17] <Dolasilla> I would say that Pendulum can simply write any update to the mailing list whenever she has any, without the need to wait for the next meeting
[18:18] <Deindre> definitely :)
[18:19] <Deindre> Dolasilla: will you introduce next Ubuntu classroom lesson?
[18:19] <Dolasilla> well basically we are now waiting to set up a date
[18:19] <Dolasilla> for the classroom about the local UbuntuWomen experience we are having in Italy
[18:20] <Dolasilla> once set we will of course share it in the mailing list and more or less spam it everywhere
[18:20] <Dolasilla> the purpose is really to encourage UbuntuWomen local initiatives
[18:20]  * Deindre likes this kind of spam :)
[18:21] <Dolasilla> to try and involve more women in locos' activities
[18:21] <Dolasilla> so status is: pending for a date
[18:22] <Deindre> yes, we could gather in ML some questions, if any, about our work, to discuss in session :)
[18:23] <Deindre> next point -> Carreer days
[18:24] <Deindre> Cheri703: is taking care about career days, but we need volunteers :)
[18:25] <Deindre> #link http://wiki.ubuntu-women.org/CareerDays
[18:25] <Dolasilla> so if you know any woman whose experience you think would be of interest and inspiration for other women please, contact her!
[18:26] <Deindre> many women during UDS gave their disponibility, it could be nice if they would keep in touch wih Chery
[18:28] <Deindre> new project
[18:30] <Deindre> I'm writing some interview to GNOME 3/ GNOME shell user, and I'll be please to involve some Ubuntu Women,
[18:30] <Deindre> so if someone is interested, please contact me
