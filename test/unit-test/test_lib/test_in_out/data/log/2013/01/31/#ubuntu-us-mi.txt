[00:50] <rick_h_> Blazeix: ^
[01:01] <Blazeix> rick_h_: thanks
[12:26] <snap-l> Good morning
[12:50] <brousch1> The snow is back
[12:50] <brousch1> And the cold
[12:59] <rick_h_> and furnace didn't start this morning...brrrr
[13:03] <brousch1> yikes
[13:06] <snap-l> Ugh. Got someone coming out to look at it rick_h_ ?
[13:06] <rick_h_> snap-l: well, reboot seems to have fixed it
[13:06] <rick_h_> so we'll see through the day I guess
[13:07] <snap-l> Reboot? You running Linux on your furnace now?
[13:07] <brousch1> Isn't everyone?
[13:07] <snap-l> I have an old-school furnace
[13:07] <snap-l> it has a little monkey shoveling coal into it
[13:07] <rick_h_> heh, it's got a single little power switch
[13:08] <rick_h_> flipping that and the burners seem to have come on
[13:08] <brousch1> Ah, so you're running DOS on yours?
[13:08] <snap-l> runfurn.bat
[13:08] <rick_h_> lol
[13:08] <snap-l> heat_70.bat
[13:09] <snap-l> furn.exe /t 70 /u f /f 1
[13:10] <rick_h_> while [ `/usr/bin/tmp` < 69 ] do /bin/run/heat done
[13:11] <snap-l> That's not going to work. You're using unix degrees
[13:11] <snap-l> You need to convert that temp stamp into farenheit
[13:19] <rick_h_> http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/01/exploring-grand-canyon-on-google-maps.html wow
[13:22] <rick_h_> man I'm not getting any work done today
[13:22] <rick_h_> need to find keyboard shortcuts for going through street view
[13:25] <snap-l> ?
[13:25] <rick_h_> ah, you logged out/in
[13:25] <rick_h_> http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/01/exploring-grand-canyon-on-google-maps.html wow
[13:26] <snap-l> yeah, restarted my machine because shit was hanging
[13:26] <snap-l> compiz was at 100%
[13:26] <snap-l> and pulseaudio gave up a few days ago, but was still playing audio
[13:27] <snap-l> OK< this is neat.
[13:53] <jjesse> beautiful day to be working from a home office
[13:55] <snap-l> yeah, I was half-tempted.
[13:58] <jjesse> anyone tried to run Ubuntu on a Nexus7?
[13:58] <jjesse> the on screen keyboard is way to small for me
[13:58] <jjesse> kept hitting the wrong keys
[14:04] <rick_h_> http://www.slashgear.com/is-googles-new-chrome-android-a-tease-for-android-apps-in-the-browser-31267578/ ok that's interesting
[14:50] <jrwren> i don't know why reboot the furnace is funny. mine is computer controlled. Yours probably is too.
[14:52] <brousch1> rick_h_: That is interesting
[14:53] <brousch1> Makes my pants feel kind of tight
[14:56] <_stink_> like you had a big meal?
[14:57] <brousch1> Right right
[15:35] <devinheitmueller> Hey, quick question:  in Ubuntu 10.X, whenever you resized a Gnome window it would show the width of the window during resize.  Seems like they got rid of that in newer versions.  Anybody know how to turn it back on (assuming it's configurable)?
[15:35] <devinheitmueller> Pardon, I mean specifically a Gnome *terminal* window.
[15:40] <jrwren> ubuntu 10.x? i'm afraid it may be that none of us run a 3 yr old ubuntu
[15:40] <rick_h_> pre-unity?
[15:41] <jrwren> oh, you mean make current ubuntu do something 10.x did.
[15:41] <jrwren> I'd ask on askbuntu.com
[15:42] <devinheitmueller> Fair enough.
[15:42] <devinheitmueller> Yeah, this is pre-unity.
[15:53] <jcastro> that's a compiz feature
[15:53] <jcastro> (tag the question with compiz)
[16:00] <devinheitmueller> jcastro: thanks.

[17:59] <brousch1> Ouch http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/31/detroit-fatal-multi-vehicle-crash/1880247/
[18:08] <Blazeix> man, cory set up the royal oak CHC dns entry without me even having to ask: http://royaloak.coffeehousecoders.com/
[18:08] <Blazeix> running off our github pages
[18:09] <Blazeix> i'll be making tweaks later tonight to make it look a bit sharper; i'm open to suggestions
[18:10] <Blazeix> aw, it's a bit messed up in IE. of course.
[18:10] <rick_h_> woot
[18:10] <rick_h_> cup fail for my browser :(
[18:10] <Blazeix> really? chrome?
[18:10] <rick_h_> well it works but not the same cup
[18:10] <Blazeix> oh, yeah, i went svg
[18:10] <rick_h_> ah, gotcha
[18:11] <Blazeix> the coffee cup _kind_ of looks like an open laptop
[18:11] <Blazeix> with a weird growth
[18:12] <rick_h_> lol
[18:12] <Blazeix> but i think it's probably a bad idea to try to play up that concept
[18:12] <rick_h_> yea
[18:12] <rick_h_> simple is best
[18:13] <widox> Blazeix: sweet
[18:13] <widox> the cup is in the middle of the page on the right side, is that right?
[18:13] <Blazeix> ...no.
[18:13] <rick_h_> Blazeix: I'd pull out the 'Other Groups' into a main body thing vs in Where
[18:14] <Blazeix> widox: should look like http://files.fuqua.io/upload/chc.png
[18:15] <Blazeix> rick_h_: yeah, i was debating just putting it down as like a footer
[18:15] <Blazeix> without a white background, but with dark text
[18:15] <rick_h_> Blazeix: yea, it's a bit too hidden atm I think
[18:15] <rick_h_> I figured just after contact can be Other Groups: with the current theme/layout
[18:15] <Blazeix> maybe, want to keep it simple though
[18:15] <rick_h_> yea, understand
[18:16] <Blazeix> i'll play around with that tonight
[18:16] <rick_h_> maybe reword the "What" to talk up part of other groups and link in there?
[18:16] <widox> Blazeix: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kslko7td52fl03p/chc_silly_mug.png
[18:16] <rick_h_> widox: what browser/version/
[18:16] <rick_h_> ?
[18:16] <Blazeix> lol filename
[18:16] <widox> :)
[18:16] <Blazeix> coffee cup what are you doing there get back in the header
[18:16] <widox> chromium 18.0.1025.168
[18:16] <rick_h_> there's no audio sprite...this must be fail
[18:17] <rick_h_> 18?!
[18:17] <Blazeix> widox: yikes, i'm on chrome 24ish
[18:17] <rick_h_> I'm on 26.0
[18:17] <widox> yeah- I think I need to update...
[18:17] <widox> silly work machine
[18:17] <rick_h_> good to know i guess, but seems like it should have auto updated?
[18:19] <widox> thought so, need to doubel check
[18:21] <widox> Blazeix: can you just steal the standard CHC image? http://www.meetup.com/CoffeeHouseCoders/photos/1726151/183839262/#183839262
[18:22] <rick_h_> fugly
[18:22] <widox> though, I liked the old cup one better... http://www.meetup.com/CoffeeHouseCoders/photos/1726151/183839262/#29091921
[18:22] <rick_h_> yea, less fugly...
[18:22] <widox> true. but, what about keeping a common theme?
[18:22] <rick_h_> an unfugly one? :)
[18:23] <Blazeix> yeah, the coffee cup was definitely constrained by what was freely available / licensed
[18:23] <Blazeix> so if someone can find a good one, i'm all for it
[18:23] <widox> http://coffeehousecode.appspot.com/static/images/logo.gif
[18:23] <widox> gotcha, just a thought
[18:25] <Blazeix> anybody know/have the original art for that?
[18:25] <Blazeix> kind of weird cup, but i suppose unique is a good thing...
[18:26] <widox> brass knuckles, yo
[18:27] <widox> no idea who originally created it though
[18:27] <rick_h_> detroit coffee!
[18:27] <rick_h_> bam!
[18:27] <Blazeix> thoughts on this? http://openclipart.org/detail/10764/coffee-cup-by-sl4yerpl-10764
[18:27] <rick_h_> it looks like it's sicking up off the side :/
[18:27] <brousch1> I thought Detroit Coffee was a cup of "water" from Lake St Clare
[18:28] <Blazeix> ooh: http://openclipart.org/detail/27828/realistic-coffee-cup---front-3d-view-by-mokush
[18:28] <Blazeix> think i'll use that one. nice and modern
[18:28] <Blazeix> basically just skulking: http://openclipart.org/search/?query=coffee
[18:28] <Blazeix> lmk if there's one you guys like
[18:29] <rick_h_> http://openclipart.org/detail/16977/coffee-by-jean_victor_balin ?
[18:30] <Blazeix> hey, that svg is actually intelligently created
[18:30] <Blazeix> like in how they laid out the svg paths
[18:32] <Blazeix> what if i added the steam lines to the current cup?
[18:32] <Blazeix> the saucer on the one you linked is kind of lacking
[18:32] <rick_h_> I'm cool with the current cup, but I agree we need to tie into the rest of the CHC better
[18:32] <rick_h_> so maybe we can just better tie in, color scheme to match with the green vs blue?
[18:32] <widox> those guys need to get off the bootstrap wagon
[18:32] <Blazeix> i think a2 is moving away from the brass knuckle cup
[18:32] <widox> which is lame
[18:33] <brousch1> Everyone loves bootstrap
[18:33] <Blazeix> i think they want to use the one on the main page of http://www.meetup.com/CoffeeHouseCoders/
[18:33] <Blazeix> which i think is terribly ugly
[18:33] <widox> agreed
[18:33] <rick_h_> yea, let's just kill that one
[18:33] <rick_h_> I'll pay a designer before I put that onto a page
[18:34] <Blazeix> what if i went from blue accents to green on the page?
[18:34] <rick_h_> yea, wondering if we do that and get some linkage up and tie in more without the logo itself it would be cool?
[18:34] <Blazeix> at least then the colors would be similar
[18:34] <brousch1> You should make a cup out of the big fist thing
[18:35] <Blazeix> but we're royal oak. maybe we could tie in weed and hippies
[18:35] <rick_h_> woot!
[18:35] <Blazeix> s/pies/sters/
[18:35] <rick_h_> but we're not AA...so not that hipster
[18:35] <brousch1> I have no idea what RO is known for
[18:35] <rick_h_> what's a toned down hipster?
[18:35] <Blazeix> yuppie?
[18:35] <rick_h_> lol
[18:36] <rick_h_> now I want to hire a designer saying we're shooting for 'yuppie'
[18:36] <widox> green version http://openclipart.org/people/TikiGiki/tikigiki_misc-coffee-cup-010.svg
[18:36] <Blazeix> the cool things about svg is it's just a css change away to change the color :)
[18:37] <Blazeix> like right now in the css i'm just saying fill:#3b3b3b to make it the darkish color
[18:37] <widox> well up the anty, multiple cups! http://openclipart.org/detail/8378/coffee-mugs-by-johnny_automatic-8378
[18:38] <Blazeix> cold war between CHCs, accumulating logo cups
[18:58] <snap-l> If anyone is looking for Christmas gifts for me, this would be an excellent start: http://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/5078098/list/A-Car-Lover-s-Man-Cave-Kicks-Into-High-Luxury-Gear
[18:59] <brousch1> D00d, it's not even February yet
[19:00] <snap-l> ;)
[19:04] <snap-l> What is Royal Oak known for?
[19:04] <snap-l> Downtown ROyal Oak is the gathering of the Douches
[19:04] <snap-l> Especially on Thursday Nights
[19:05] <snap-l> There's Bike night, and then there's DOuche night.
[19:05] <jrwren> restaurant city!
[19:07] <rick_h_> snap-l: want!
[19:11] <snap-l> rick_h_: Yeah, no kidding
[19:11] <rick_h_> so much wood!
[19:11] <snap-l> And that's before we talk lumber.
[19:30] <jcastro> man
[19:30] <jcastro> they are real desperate to get me back on contract
[19:31] <rick_h_> hah
[19:31] <rick_h_> noooo, you can't escape
[19:31] <jcastro> $79 for both of us, unlimited everything
[19:32] <brousch1> What's that?
[19:32] <jcastro> tmo
[19:39] <brousch1> ah
[19:41] <jcastro> snap-l: it's not ting but I switched to simple and that's $600 a year in savings
[19:43] <rick_h_> wow, amazon.com down
[19:48] <snap-l> http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/amazon.com.html
[19:49] <snap-l> jcastro: That's awesome. I paid $8 last month for my bill because of referrals. ;)
[19:51] <brousch1> ohshit. I'm heading for the bunker.
[19:53] <rick_h_> bunker?
[19:53] <rick_h_> does it have pie?
[19:55] <brousch1> Spam and water
[19:56] <_stink_> you can make pie from that
[19:56] <snap-l> You can make me throw up from that too
[20:04] <snap-l> http://tomato.es/ <- Interesting if anyone is using Pomodoro
[20:18] <jjesse> i'm on amazon.com right now
[20:18] <snap-l> I can't get to the front page
[20:19] <snap-l> everything else seems to work, though.
[20:19] <jjesse> ah its the front page
[20:19] <rick_h_> yea, I mean I figure it'll get updated and start working
[20:19] <jjesse> you are right everything else does work
[20:19] <rick_h_> but still was floored to see it down. Kind of like not getting google
[20:19] <brousch1> jjesse: Enjoying this blizzard?
[20:20] <jjesse> brousch1, yeah its pretty cool
[20:20] <jjesse> had to go rescue my dad cause his car died on the highway
[20:20] <brousch1> nice
[20:20] <jjesse> good thing he was safe and on the shoulder
[20:20] <brousch1> I'm home sick with the kid again today. We're watching the snow pile up
[20:21] <jjesse> just needed to pick him up
[20:21] <jjesse> yeah i'm working from home today
[20:21] <jjesse> wife was supposed to do a girls night thing on the northwest side of town, i don't think she is going
[21:48] <jhansonxi> Us folks up near Alpena don't get snow like you southerners.  Just cold and windy.
[23:28] <Blazeix> any idea who this is? http://www.meetup.com/Coffee-House-Coders/-48374/
[23:28] <Blazeix> founded January 31, 2013
[23:39] <rick_h_> hmm, no udea
[23:39] <rick_h_> idea
[23:40] <brousch1> It is snap-l starting a splinter-cell
[23:43] <snap-l> brousch1: I wouldn't do one in Novi
[23:49] <brousch1> Exactly. It's misdirection
[23:49] <brousch1> You're devious
[23:56] <snap-l> I'm mor eclever than I realize, then. :)
