[11:58] <rdn> Any idea why a working job would turn into "start: Unknown job: " after system restart? I've tried reload-configuration and the job file does end in .conf
[12:00] <rdn> Nevermind; there was an error introduced that check-config didn't mention
[12:38] <xnox> jodh: so both me and stgraber were merging from trunk. hence now it's a big criss-cross merge.... *sigh* =)
[13:10] <xnox> jodh: synced up now. should merge without conflicts now.
[13:12] <jodh> xnox: thanks!
[19:42] <xnox> stgraber: error is good, and the fact that it carries on running is also great.
[19:43] <xnox> we are really in a non-standard situation if there is no HOME and no XDG_RUNTIME_DIR.
[19:44] <stgraber> yep
[20:50] <methods> can i use upstart to simply make sure a service keeps running that only uses /etc/init.d script ?
[20:50] <methods> a package i install only uses /etc/init.d but i'd like upstart or something similar to make sure it's always running
