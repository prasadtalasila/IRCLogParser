[02:16] <a5m0> according to the update news for thunar it looks like "show transfer speed" has been added in 1.5.0 but it looks like xubuntu 12.10 is still using thunar 1.4.0, when will it be updated?
[02:24] <knome> for 13.04
[02:39] <donnie> I have dosfstools. Should I install the debug as well? I have an SD card that's not being read by a device and it's Fat32 as well

[20:12] <KeyboardNotFound> Hello all, how they talk microphone to listen to the speakers ?
[20:12] <KeyboardNotFound> i use xubuntu 12.10
[20:14] <holstein> !sound
[20:14] <ubottu> If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[20:14] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: i would look at 'pavucontrol'
[20:15] <KeyboardNotFound> yes i'm in "pavucontrol" but i don't know how to setup
[20:15] <KeyboardNotFound> :D
[20:16] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: im not sure what you are trying to setup.. but if you are trying to hear the microphone from the speakers, see that all is not muted... see that sound is working. see that the mic is working in pavucontrol, then move on to routing
[20:21] <KeyboardNotFound> i like to speak on microphone, and the sound from the microphone to listen on speakers, actually speakers to hear what I'm talking microphone
[20:22] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: sure.. then make sure sound is working.. and make sure the mic is working (there is a meter in pavucontrol) then move on to routing that mic input to the speakers
[20:22] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: is sound working?
[20:22] <KeyboardNotFound> yes sound and microphone working
[20:23] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: how have you determined the mic is working?
[20:23] <KeyboardNotFound> yes mic working
[20:23] <KeyboardNotFound> and speakers working
[20:23] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: *if* the mic is working.. then just unmute the mic
[20:23] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: try in the terminal... in alsamixer
[20:24] <KeyboardNotFound> mic is unmute
[20:24] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: i dont think so
[20:24] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: how do you know the mic is working?
[20:24] <KeyboardNotFound> you don't understand me
[20:24] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: correct. i dont understand you
[20:25] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: how do you know the mic is working?
[20:25] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: how did you determine that?
[20:25] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: did you see a meter moving?
[20:25] <KeyboardNotFound> yes
[20:25] <KeyboardNotFound> meter moving
[20:25] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: i assume you didnt hear anything from the mic, since that is the question
[20:25] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: OK. then the mic is either muted or not routed to the speakers
[20:26] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: the mic can me recordable, and be muted to the speakers
[20:26] <KeyboardNotFound> yes mic is not routed to the speakers
[20:26] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: i dont think so
[20:26] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: you'll have to entertain the idea that something is not routed properly.. or it is muted
[20:26] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: the defaut setup is to *not* have the mic in the speakers
[20:27] <KeyboardNotFound> yes
[20:27] <KeyboardNotFound> noo, you don't understand me
[20:27] <KeyboardNotFound> example: i talking on microphone
[20:27] <knome> KeyboardNotFound, what's your native language?
[20:28] <KeyboardNotFound> Macedoian, but i speak very good and serbian/hrvatian
[20:28] <knome> !serbian | KeyboardNotFound
[20:28] <ubottu> KeyboardNotFound: Molimo udjite u #ubuntu-rs za pomoc u vezi sa Ubuntuom na srpskom jeziku.
[20:29] <KeyboardNotFound> i talking on mic, and i like the sound what i talk on mic to listen on speakers
[20:29] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: sure.. its not easy to do that though. its not desirable to most
[20:30] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: i will do this and tell you *exactly* how
[20:30] <holstein> or you can try one of the native speaking volunteers knome suggested
[20:30] <KeyboardNotFound> ok, i will try
[20:31] <KeyboardNotFound> thanks for desire for help
[20:31] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: i would also consider JACK
[20:32] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: its overkill for your purposes, but you can route things easier
[20:33] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: i have made that happen, though it is different for different hardware configurations
[20:33] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: i would open alsamixer, hit f5 and dont trust any labels.. i would use pavucontrol and tweak all the settings
[20:34] <holstein> http://s8dragon.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/listen-to-microphone-over-the-speakers-using-pulseaudio/ is relevant
[20:35] <holstein> KeyboardNotFound: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/483812 as well
[20:35] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 483812 in pulseaudio (Ubuntu) "Pulseaudio will not route internal/external mic to the speakers/headphones Karmic" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[20:39] <KeyboardNotFound> holstein: thanks for help, but i will hang :(
[23:02] <asterismo> hey what about the banner on the ubuntu webpage?
[23:02] <asterismo> any clues?
[23:03] <TheSheep> asterismo: what about it?
[23:03] <Noskcaj> asterismo, as the name suggests, it is an announcement related to touch support in ubuntu
[23:04] <asterismo> do not understand
[23:04] <KeyboardNotFound> how to rotate my photo ?
[23:04] <asterismo> ubuntu has touch support already, right?
[23:04] <Noskcaj> http://www.redmondpie.com/countdown-for-next-big-ubuntu-release-begins-strong-suggestion-of-touch-based-os/
[23:04] <KeyboardNotFound> i use ristretto 0.6.3 to view .jpeg
[23:04] <asterismo> touch based os?
[23:05] <knome> asterismo, this is the channel for xubuntu, not ubuntu
[23:05] <asterismo> wasn't that Ubuntu for Android?
[23:05] <knome> uh... xubuntu? nope.
[23:07] <KeyboardNotFound> how to rotate picture in ristretto 0.6.3
[23:07] <knome> !patience | KeyboardNotFound
[23:07] <ubottu> KeyboardNotFound: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
[23:07] <asterismo> knome, what i'm asking could affect pottentially xubutnu so i ask in this channel, besides i use xubuntu
[23:07] <asterismo> knome, but, nevermind... i'm done
[23:08] <asterismo> goodbye
[23:08] <knome> asterismo, i'm just saying people in this channel probably don't know about something on the ubuntu website (i don't)
[23:08] <knome> asterismo, but as far as i know, there's nothing like that in xubuntu at least, so you'd be better asking in #ubuntu
[23:11] <asterismo> knome, i asked here because people may reply faster, i'm also in #ubuntu #ubuntu-beginners #ubuntu-beginners-team @xfce and many others, if i offended you by asking something about "ubuntu" in a "xubuntu" channel, it won't happen again. Happy new year...
