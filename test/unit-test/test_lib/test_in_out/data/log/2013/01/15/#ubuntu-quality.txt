[00:33] <Noskcaj> how do i download files in a autopilot testcase?
[00:38] <balloons> Noskcaj, they're not up yet.. I'm working on packaging them
[00:40] <Noskcaj> balloons: i mean download a file that is used in the testcase.
[00:40] <balloons> ahh
[00:41] <Noskcaj> it could be part of the testsuite download if that makes things easier
[00:41] <balloons> you can use urllib2
[00:41] <balloons> have the test download the file
[00:41] <balloons> or, package it in with the test and reference it
[00:42] <balloons> probably best to keep it local if possible / makes sense
[00:43] <Noskcaj> ok, all it's just a .torrent file for the transmition testcase
[00:43] <Noskcaj> another option is just call Wget though the testcase
[01:00] <balloons> Noskcaj, urllib2 is more python like
[01:00] <Noskcaj> ok, i will lok into it once i get the manual version of the testcase made.

[12:14] <smartboyhw> phillw, ping me when you wake up
[13:38] <cprofitt> names
[13:38] <cprofitt> hello all
[14:21] <jibel> pitti, I modified jhbuild/jenkins integration script so jenkins reports a red dot when there is a build failure, a yellow dot when make check failed and green on success
[14:21] <jibel> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Raring/view/JHBuild%20Gnome/job/jhbuild-amd64-gvfs/ for example
[14:21] <pitti> oh, awesome
[14:21] <pitti> that's really useful, merci!
[14:22] <jibel> I'll rebuild the whole stack
[14:22] <pitti> I'm having fun throwing patches towards the gstreamer author to fix those failures
[14:47] <pitti> jibel: https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Raring/view/JHBuild%20Gnome/job/jhbuild-amd64-gnome-settings-daemon/40/artifact/gnome-settings-daemon.log -> seems we need to tell our jhbuild to stop using the wacom system package; I'll look into the current charm
[14:49] <jibel> pitti, yes, should be fixed in next build
[14:49] <pitti> jibel: oh, you already did? sweet!
[14:50] <jibel> pitti, pure coincidence :)
[14:50] <pitti> jibel: you didn't fix that in the charm, though?
[14:51] <jibel> pitti, no, I fixed it directly in the test env.
[14:51] <pitti> hm, the only skip we have is libgphoto2
[14:52] <pitti> I wonder why it wasn't built in the first place
[14:53] <pitti> jibel: I'm looking into the glib failure now
[14:53] <pitti> jibel: would it be possible for you to add my ssh key to the cloud instance that runs the production builds?
[14:54] <pitti> faster than replicating the whole thing
[14:54] <pitti> or should I rather replicate it?
[14:54] <jibel> pitti, it's running in the QA lab
[14:55] <pitti> ah, we are not actually using the charm, right
[14:56] <jibel> pitti, no, not for production, last time I lost my instance, I redeployed everything in an lxc container

[16:23] <SergioMeneses> balloons, around?
[16:24] <SergioMeneses> or phillw,
[16:25] <balloons> sure
[16:29] <SergioMeneses> balloons, I have a question about testcases
[16:29] <balloons> go for it
[16:29] <SergioMeneses> balloons, I have this one http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/243/builds/34387/testcases/1300/results
[16:30] <SergioMeneses> I have all steps but the problem is when I start ubuntu I cant see the wallpaper and my mouse
[16:31] <SergioMeneses> I have seen this and it is a bug but I dont know if submit the result as passed or failed
[16:31] <SergioMeneses> what do you say?
[16:32]  * balloons looks
[16:33] <SergioMeneses> you can see the bugs here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1080437
[16:33] <balloons> sounds like a 'passed' since the install worked, but with a bug, since upon booting there is an issue
[16:33] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1080437 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Raring) "no background during the 13.04 daily install" [High,Confirmed]
[16:33] <balloons> ahh yes
[16:33] <SergioMeneses> and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1080674
[16:33] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1080674 in cairo "[QEMU] Corrupted desktop screen for raring desktop installation in QEMU guest (Cirrus graphics). Affects KVM but not VBox." [Medium,Confirmed]
[16:33] <balloons> so then mark passed, and put that bug number in
[16:33] <SergioMeneses> balloons, ok
[16:34] <SergioMeneses> balloons, look http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/243/builds/34387/testcases/1300/results
[16:34] <balloons> good stuff
[16:35] <SergioMeneses> balloons, thanks a lot!

[16:42] <SergioMeneses> btw balloons are you ready for your session?
[16:43] <balloons> something like that yea :-)
[16:43] <SergioMeneses> great!

[19:35] <dkessel> roadmr: do you think a bug like "checkbox does not discover bluetooth device" would be a duplicate? i can't find a dupe, but I want to ask before filing a bug...
[19:35] <roadmr> dkessel: hm, let me have a quick look
[19:40] <roadmr> dkessel: I find nothing relevant, it's OK if you file a bug, ubuntu-bug works fine with checkbox
[19:40] <roadmr> dkessel: so you have a bluetooth controller, but checkbox is not showing you bluetooth tests?
[19:41] <roadmr> dkessel: if you want to file a bug, I'd appreciate if you could run
[19:41] <roadmr> /usr/share/checkbox/scripts/udev_resource >/tmp/udev_resource.txt
[19:41] <roadmr> and then append that file. I'm going to ask for it at some point anyway :)
[19:41] <dkessel> roadmr: yes, i tried running checkbox from the current precise iso. the bluetooth controller shows up in the top panel, but checkbox won't show such tests.
[19:41] <dkessel> roadmr: thanks, will do that
[19:42] <roadmr> dkessel: strange :) well, with the udev_resource output we can figure it out I hope
[19:43] <roadmr> dkessel: the bluetooth tests depend on having a device with category: BLUETOOTH in udev_resource output, you can even check yourself if you do have such a device
[19:43] <roadmr> dkessel: if not, we'd have to look at udevadm raw output, but let's not get ahead of ourselves
[19:43]  * dkessel waits for apport to collect data
[19:47] <roadmr> dkessel: please point me to the bug once it's filed :) launchpad can take a while to notify me
[19:48] <dkessel> roadmr: lol... i guess i was wrong. false alarm. that netbook doesn't have a bluetooth controller. so i guess the real bug is that the bluetooth icon is displayed in the tray icon area... meh
[19:48] <roadmr> dkessel: hehe :)
[19:48] <dkessel> sorry for the confusion :)
[19:48] <roadmr> dkessel: no worries, always glad to be of help
[19:49] <dkessel> any idea what populates the indicator area?
[19:51] <roadmr> dkessel: nope, sorry :/ I see a bluetooth-applet but I'm not sure under which circumnstances it runs
[19:51] <dkessel> i'll see if #ubuntu-devel knows about it

[20:26] <letozaf_> Hi everyone!
[20:26] <dkessel> hey
[20:27] <balloons> howdy!
[20:28] <letozaf_> Has anyone tried the "Install (erase and re-install) test"  ? because I'm running it again as yesterday after second reboot I got only a black screen
[20:28] <balloons> SergioMeneses, I believe had that issue this morning
[20:28] <letozaf_> I'm trying to find out if it happens again
[20:28] <letozaf_> balloons, on the same test ?
[20:29] <balloons> mmm.. let me see
[20:29] <SergioMeneses> balloons, letozaf_ \o
[20:29] <balloons> my screen is cluttered
[20:29] <SergioMeneses> I have not wallpaper
[20:29] <SergioMeneses> but the system works fine
[20:29] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, I couln't log on, but I will see what happens
[20:29] <letozaf_> re-running the test
[20:30] <letozaf_> did you test the Ubuntu Desktop amd64 ISO?
[20:30] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, yes I did
[20:31] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, I did two test on virtuabox and testdrive
[20:31] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses,  oh!, se lets see what happens, I am still running it for the second time also I ran the tests on Virtualbox
[20:32] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, I did the pulseaudio tests with the dayli-sio http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/251/builds/34454/testcases/1336/results
[20:33] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, if you need something, please let me know
[20:34] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, ok, when I have finished re-running the test I will let you know, thanks
[20:34] <SergioMeneses> btw balloons have we more thing to do on http://laptop.qa.ubuntu.com/ ?
[20:35] <balloons> SergioMeneses, hmm.. we shouod really archive those results
[20:35] <balloons> the old one
[20:35] <SergioMeneses> balloons, perfect
[20:35] <SergioMeneses> and how?
[20:36] <balloons> refresh the page :-
[20:37] <balloons> I left the last final iso test as release
[20:38] <balloons> as well as the raring one we did
[20:38] <balloons> anything else?
[20:38] <SergioMeneses> balloons, perfect
[20:38] <SergioMeneses> balloons, we have not more testcases or something only for laptops?
[20:39] <balloons> SergioMeneses, we can certainly create more
[20:39] <balloons> my thoughts on that are to continue moving forward on the hw db stuff
[20:40] <SergioMeneses> balloons, sounds good for me! do you know where is Sergio?
[20:40] <balloons> he's typically not able to be on IRC
[20:41] <balloons> letozaf_, do you ever speak with Sergio?
[20:41] <SergioMeneses> I see
[20:41] <SergioMeneses> SergioZancheta
[20:41] <letozaf_> balloons, well not often
[20:41] <letozaf_> I mean we came to UDS together but before we met only like 3 or 4 times in person
[20:42] <letozaf_> I hear him by mail
[20:42] <letozaf_> but it's not a problem to contact him
[20:42] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, did you go to uds?
[20:42] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, yes
[20:42] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, I went too
[20:43] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, nooo!! probably we even met and don't know
[20:43] <letozaf_> lol
[20:44] <SergioMeneses> o0
[20:45] <letozaf_> balloons, if you need me to contact Sergio Zanchetta I will try also with google talk, last time he contacted me on google talk
[20:45] <balloons> letozaf_, ty
[20:46] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, I think we can meet someday by gtalk
[20:46] <letozaf_> balloons, sure
[20:47] <SergioMeneses> all we work with laptops so we can talk about our own project
[20:47] <letozaf_> balloons, but didn't Sergio Z. get in contact with you yet, he told me he would
[20:47] <balloons> umm.. we spoke briefly at one point
[20:47] <balloons> I'm trying to remember
[20:47] <balloons> my brain is drained today
[20:47] <balloons> let me put something on the list here
[20:48] <balloons> let's see..
[20:48] <balloons> ohh yes, Carla you and Sergio responded saying you would do a laptop testing session right?
[20:48] <SergioMeneses> balloons, letozaf_ I remember he answered email about the classroom sessions, no more
[20:49] <balloons> so let's get that settled
[20:49] <balloons> then, yes, he should participate in the discussionson the list about the hw db
[20:49] <balloons> imho
[20:50] <letozaf_> balloons, yes I agree
[20:51] <SergioMeneses> perfect
[20:51] <letozaf_> balloons, when ?
[20:56] <bdmurray> psivaa: I'll bring it up in tomorrow's meeting
=== salem_ is now known as _salem
[21:17] <balloons> sorry missed that
[21:17] <balloons> what do you mean when? I owe the thread a response :-
[21:19] <letozaf_> balloons, maybe I misunderstood, I understood you wanted us to meet on gtalk
[21:19] <letozaf_> so I asked when
[21:19] <balloons> ahh
[21:20] <letozaf_> so maybe I could get Sergio top
[21:20] <balloons> we certainly can.. we could do a hangout if needed
[21:20] <letozaf_> sorry too non top
[21:20] <balloons> but I just want him invovled in the discussions
[21:20] <balloons> so its more than just me :)
[21:21] <letozaf_> yea right! :)
[21:22] <balloons> lol
[21:22] <letozaf_> :)
[21:30] <letozaf_> balloons, now I saw that you asked me about the laptop testing session, didn't Sergio Z. contact you about that yet ?
[21:30] <balloons> nothing more
[21:30] <letozaf_> balloons, I will contact him and see what's up!
[21:31] <letozaf_> maye he's busy :)

[21:44] <SergioMeneses> soryy I was attending a loco-council meeting
[21:44] <balloons> bug hug!
[21:46] <letozaf_> wow sounds good
[21:46] <letozaf_> but I think I need to stick with one thing at a time
[21:47] <letozaf_> and now I'm on autopilot :)
[21:47] <letozaf_> I'd like to, but unfortunately we have only 24 hours in a day :(
[21:47] <balloons> :-)
[21:57] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, sure! Im reading about autopilot too, I expect to work with it soon
[21:57] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, great! It's real fun :)
[21:58] <SergioMeneses> yeah! I did a video about it
[21:59] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, yes I saw part of it, maybe I should take time to watch it all, but I think it's nice, good job!
[22:00] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, you can do other, if you wan to
[22:00] <SergioMeneses> *want
[22:00] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, do you mean other tests in autopilot or other videos?
[22:01] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, videos
[22:01] <SergioMeneses> do you speak only English?
[22:02] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, no I'm Italian so I speak Italian
[22:02] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, but I'm not good in making videos, or better, I prefer to test than to do videos
[22:03] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, I have more fun in testing and doing autopilot tests
[22:04] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, sure :)
[22:05] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, I think you do a good job in doing videos :)
[22:05] <SergioMeneses> letozaf_, it is the only one
[22:05] <SergioMeneses> xD
[22:05] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, the important thing is having fun when you do a thing
[22:06] <SergioMeneses> that's really true
[22:06] <letozaf_> SergioMeneses, yep!
[22:06] <letozaf_> well I'm going to bed now, it's late and tomorrow I have to get up early
