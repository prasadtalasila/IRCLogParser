[14:45] <lfaraone> Is this the right place to make suggestions to the ubuntu.com text?
[14:47] <lfaraone> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-desktop-latest is great, but it isn't linked from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?release=latest&bits=32&distro=desktop, or even from the "official documentation" link which shows a guide of how to use ubuntu, not how to install it.
[18:15] <jbicha> lfaraone: hey, how are you doing?
[18:17] <jbicha> I believe the correct place to make website improvement suggestions is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website-content/+filebug
