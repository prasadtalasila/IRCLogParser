[10:31] <rmg51> Morning
[10:59] <JonathanD> Morning.
[13:03] <teddy-dbear> Morning peoples
[13:16] <JonathanD> Hi.
[13:41] <teddy-dbear> o/
[16:55] <ChinnoDog> morning, peeps
[17:28] <InHisName> ChinnoDog: You like to nom on peeps ?
[17:52] <ChinnoDog> Sometimes. Especially when they are roasted over an open fire until the sugar carmelizes.
[18:23] <ChinnoDog> pleia2 eats them that way
[18:32] <InHisName> ChinnoDog: invite me next time you build a fire and have ample stock.
[18:33] <InHisName> Sounds yummy
[19:01] <pleia2> only on special occasions
[19:05] <ChinnoDog> There should be more of those. We could have a peep roasting contest.
[19:15] <pleia2> I don't actually like them :)
[19:15] <pleia2> but on a freezing bethlehem night, it's an acceptable thing to do
[19:20] <ChinnoDog> They are good at negative degree temperatures. (I don't like them either.)
[19:41] <calvin_> waltman: yeah, going to Ko's guys really was the solution!
[19:41] <calvin_> major help
=== calvin_ is now known as MidgetTurkey
[19:43] <MidgetTurkey> Anyone have advice for managing 124tb of data while maintaning backups and redundancy?
[19:43] <ChinnoDog> Midget? Must be wild. Domesticated turkeys can get up to 70lbs.
[19:43] <MidgetTurkey> heh
[19:43] <MutantTurkey> wait what... I'm already logged in a nother window
[19:43] <MutantTurkey> sigh
[19:44] <MutantTurkey> silly me
[19:44] <ChinnoDog> haha
[19:46] <MutantTurkey> question still stands
[19:46] <MutantTurkey>  Anyone have advice for managing 124tb of data while maintaning backups and
[19:46] <MutantTurkey>                       redundancy?
[19:46] <MutantTurkey> whoops sorry
[19:50] <ChinnoDog> 124tb is a lot
[19:51] <JonathanD> MutantTurkey: I'd just print a copy out, personally.
[19:51] <JonathanD> just print it in hex, and you can type it back in if something goes wrong.
[19:56] <ChinnoDog> MutantTurkey: What type of uptime do you need to mantain?
[20:06] <MutantTurkey> heh
[20:06] <MutantTurkey> ChinnoDog: as up as possible
[20:06] <MutantTurkey> i need more like, equipment recommendations
[20:06] <MutantTurkey> what kind of server do i buy that has that ind of capacity
[20:15] <ChinnoDog> You are going to have to define these parameters before you can answer your question
[20:15] <ChinnoDog> For example, on my home computer I can tolerate a few days of downtime because of a disaster. If I lose my files no one is going to die or fortunes lost.
[20:16] <ChinnoDog> I only use RAID 0. I run external backups to a slow external USB drive and also to the internet.
[20:16] <ChinnoDog> If a drive dies I will restore from external USB. If the apartment burns down I will order a backup of my data from Crashplan.
[20:18] <ChinnoDog> My server will not stay up if a drive fails. In order to do that I would need more disks and have to spend more money and I would /still/ need an external backup plan
[20:20] <ChinnoDog> At 124tb the cost of the redundancy is cheaper depending on how resistant to failure you want to be. Theoretically you could build a 124tb volume using 42 3tb drives + 1 for RAID5 and be resistant to the failure of one disk
[20:20] <ChinnoDog> You can figure out how frequently you will be replacing disks using the MTBF ratings of the drives
[20:20] <ChinnoDog> You can also calculate the likelyhood of two drives failing at the same time
[20:29] <MutantTurkey> downtime, one day.
[20:29] <MutantTurkey> we have a raid6 array right now
[20:29] <MutantTurkey> I haven't seen it yet so I don't know what's there physically
[20:37] <ChinnoDog> That sounds suitable for that number of drives so long as you don't waste too many on parity.
[20:42] <MutantTurkey> yeah?
[20:46] <ChinnoDog> Using RAID 6 you are utilizing the capacity of all the drives minutes the 1+ drives for parity. You can scale the number of drives for parity based on your MTBF calculation.
[20:46] <ChinnoDog> s/minutes/minus/
[20:50] <ChinnoDog> Why hasn't anyone written a RAID accelerator using OpenCL? is it just me or is that a natural application? Video chipsets with stream processors are creeping into server boards, might as well make use of them.
[20:52] <ChinnoDog> For that matter OpenCL would be perfect for file system compression too.
[21:43] <waltman> MutantTurkey: cool
[21:43] <waltman> so they actually knew about a library?
[21:59] <MutantTurkey> well no, but they are python pros
[21:59] <MutantTurkey> so we did it in python
[22:00] <MutantTurkey> turns out that function only has one implementation
[22:00] <MutantTurkey> the origional one
[22:06] <waltman> MutantTurkey: hah
[22:36] <MutantTurkey> setting up nagios now
