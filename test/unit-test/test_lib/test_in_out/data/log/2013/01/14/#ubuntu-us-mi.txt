[14:15] <rick_h_> lol, the daily show found out about the Canadian bridge proposal http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/wed-january-9-2013-jeff-bridges
[14:31] <jjesse> morning
[14:38]  * jjesse pours himself an extra large cup of coffee 
[14:38] <snap-l> heh
[14:39] <jrwren> good morning!
[14:39] <jjesse> my son is on week 6 of coughing
[14:39] <jjesse> and now it is affecting sleep patterns
[14:39] <jrwren> been to Doctor?
[14:39] <jrwren> I've heard whooping cough is going around.
[14:40] <jjesse> yeah was there at 7am this morning for "open hours"
[14:40] <jjesse> but no wheezing, no fever, lungs sound good
[14:40] <jjesse> all that fun stuff
[14:40] <jjesse> double up on his inhalers and pray it runs it course soon
[14:41] <brousch> jjesse: We just got done with a week of that
[14:42] <brousch> ug
[14:42] <jjesse> we are on week 6
[14:42] <jjesse> so basically nothing to do
[14:45] <jrwren> how old?
[14:45] <jjesse> 4
[14:46] <jjesse> well 4.5
[14:56] <JonEdney> Well, I don't know about anyone else, but I miss the 60 degrees we had Saturday.
[14:56] <snap-l> Yep, me too.
[16:03] <snap-l> Two Gentle Giant songs on Delicious Agony in the past hour.
[16:03]  * snap-l needs to get some more Gentle Giant albums
[16:03] <rick_h_> jjesse: :(
[16:04] <jjesse> yeah
[16:04] <rick_h_> meh, I like winter to be winter
[16:05] <brousch> Snow sucks
[16:10] <greg-g> it was 34 on my ride to the caltrain this morning
[16:10] <rick_h_> yea, chilly today
[16:10] <rick_h_> icy
[16:10] <rick_h_> but snow rules
[16:10] <snap-l> bbbbrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[16:10] <snap-l> You can have my share in spades.
[16:11] <brousch> You can have my share in shovels
[16:11] <snap-l> heh

[18:04] <rick_h_> greg-g: 10wks later...shiny! http://www.flickr.com/photos/7508761@N03/8381306910/
[18:05] <snap-l> I saw
[18:05] <snap-l> ;)
[18:05] <greg-g> rick_h_: oh man, so jealous!
[18:06] <rick_h_> http://www.flickr.com/photos/7508761@N03/8381307204/ next to my saw I've been using
[18:06] <greg-g> oh, they're from la crosse, awesome
[18:06] <rick_h_> yea, guy is from WI that makes them
[18:06] <greg-g> so nice
[18:07]  * rick_h_ resists urge to submit 1/2 vaca right now...
[18:07] <snap-l> "Yeah boss, I want to take the rest of the day off. I'm sawing logs"
[18:08] <greg-g> heh
[18:08] <rick_h_> psh, http://www.flickr.com/photos/7508761@N03/8379174766/in/photostream/ all need to get cut to length
[18:08] <rick_h_> was waiting for these to arrive
[18:09] <rick_h_> got them all cut to width and cleaned up last night. So now just lots of sawing ends to the right length and the fun begins
[18:10] <snap-l> Nice.
[18:10] <snap-l> btw: ordered JoDee's phone yesterday. Hopefully should have it soon
[18:10] <snap-l> Galaxy Nexus
[18:10] <rick_h_> nice, <3 mine
[18:10] <rick_h_> though erica was on board with the larger size but the other day said it was too big
[18:10] <snap-l> Once again, JoDee will have a nicer phone than me. ;)
[18:11] <rick_h_> going to get hard to get her next one as all these phones just keep getting bigger and bigger
[18:11] <rick_h_> hah, I've got to order my wife a new laptop this week
[18:11] <rick_h_> :( when she has newer hardware than me
[18:11] <snap-l> Yeah, the Galaxy S3 seemed a little too big
[18:11] <snap-l> but then again, she had a Thunderbolt, which was big for the time
[18:13] <jrwren> s3 is huge
[18:13] <snap-l> http://smartphones.techcrunch.com/compare/171-245/Samsung-Galaxy-Nexus-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-S3
[18:14] <snap-l> Funny enough, they're roughly the same size
[18:21] <jcastro> I just got an extended battery for my Galaxy nexus
[18:21] <jcastro> so it's huger
[18:22] <rick_h_> yea, I gave mine to my wife. I need to get another one. Makes a nice difference
[18:22] <rick_h_> wasn't that much bigger. When I got the one for the incredible it basically doubled the thickness
[18:22] <jcastro> yeah
[18:22] <snap-l> Yeah, as long as it can use a decent case along with it, I think she'll be happy.
[18:22] <jcastro> luckily samsung phones are so stupidly thin that adding the battery makes them feel normal
[18:23] <snap-l> That was the big thing with the Thunderbolt: It was already a pretty thick phone
[18:23] <rick_h_> yea, I can't do cases
[18:23] <snap-l> The case that I have adds some serious heft to it
[18:23] <rick_h_> my wife's case makes the phone seem so much larger
[18:24] <snap-l> I took the case off to clean the phone, and it felt so dainty
[18:24] <rick_h_> lol
[18:24] <snap-l> like it would slip out of my hands at any moment
[18:25] <jcastro> I can't stand cases
[18:25] <brousch> cases--
[18:25] <snap-l> I can't stand cheap cases
[18:26] <snap-l> This Trident case is quite nice.
[18:26] <snap-l> Problem with this phone is if I drop it, it separates
[18:26] <snap-l> the back is on pretty loose.
[18:26] <brousch> You don't buy a Ferrari and then coat it in bubble wrap
[18:27] <snap-l> You don't buy a cheeseburger and expect it to take a 5 G drop unscathed
[18:37] <greg-g> mmmmm, cheeseburger
[19:05] <Blazeix> gah, using a chaining api, and forgot a semicolon
[19:06] <Blazeix> crap was chaining where it should not have been. took me 20 minutes to debug
[19:06]  * rick_h_ hates chaining
[22:08] <snap-l> I really hate waiting for people to get back with me.
[22:09]  * snap-l is impatient
[22:15] <_stink_> no, i will not marry you.
[22:16] <snap-l> _stink_: That would have been good to know TEN FREAKING YEARS AGO!
[22:16] <snap-l> *sob*
[22:16]  * snap-l changes his relationship status with _stink_ to "It's complicated"
[22:16] <_stink_> look, people change
[22:17] <_stink_> i want to see other people
[22:17] <_stink_> it's not you, it's me
[22:17] <snap-l> Whew, for a second I thought it was me
[22:17] <snap-l> that takes a load off my mind
[22:17] <_stink_> *uncomfortable silence*
[22:18] <snap-l> I like to see other people too, but unfortunately I keep seeing the same person in the mirror
[22:18] <snap-l> And the restraining order makes it awkward.
