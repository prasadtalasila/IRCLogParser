[11:03] <therve> hazmat, https://code.launchpad.net/~therve/juju/rapi-uuid/+merge/143662 adds the UUID to the API
[11:03] <therve> I hope that makes sense, let me know if I miss something
[11:10] <hazmat> therve, cool. i've got an in progress branch that requires login..
[11:10] <hazmat> therve, also merge proposal target should be the rollup branch (i resubmitted the mp)
[11:11] <hazmat> therve, looks good though
[11:11] <hazmat> thanks
[11:17] <therve> hazmat, thank you!
[11:57] <hazmat> gary_poster, benji i don't suppose either of you have that login required communication pastebin link
[13:09] <gary_poster> hazmat not sure what you are asking for
[13:16] <hazmat> gary_poster, just trying to work out if 'login-required' was in the greeting or if there was a separate not auth greeting
[13:16] <hazmat> currently we're disclosing provider type and soon uuid in the greeting
[13:17] <hazmat> we had a pastebin text doc we passed around as an example
[13:17] <hazmat> just trying to locate a ref to it
[13:17] <gary_poster> oh
[13:17] <gary_poster> I think I know what you mean
[13:18] <gary_poster> but benji told me it was pretty different from what ended coming from juju.  may be misremembering.  I can find, one sec
[13:19] <gary_poster> hazmat, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1397723/ ?
[13:19] <hazmat> gary_poster, thanks
[13:19] <benji> yeah, that doesn't match reality (at least the reality that existed when I was working on the branch)
[13:24] <hazmat> benji, well it wasn't required before... so no. but my current branch makes it required.. just wanted to match more closely to that doc
[13:25] <benji> sounds good
[13:25] <gary_poster> bug for these backend changes is bug 1074419 fwiw

[13:34] <gary_poster> thanks hazmat.  forgot to press Join :-P
[14:52] <gary_poster> frankban, it strikes me that bac's approach of protecting within the login method is nice in that it also protects from the unlikely but possible situation of someone typing in a password in the login page and submitting it before the connection is ready.  I suppose we could not draw the login page in that case...but something else to consider.  One other edge case to consider is whether multiple login requests migh
[14:52] <gary_poster> t be pending.  Maybe not an issue, but just came to my mind.
[14:53] <frankban> gary_poster: ack
[14:54] <gary_poster> thx
[14:56] <gary_poster> frankban, https://codereview.appspot.com/7138054/ : land as is, thank you
[14:57] <frankban> gary_poster: cool, thanks
[14:58] <frankban> gary_poster: just for curiosity, is there a reason why we don't indent if blocks in our makefile?
[14:59] <gary_poster> frankban, probably because didn't know we could, within the context of these macros.  I think indentation has meaning, and macros don't dedent.  If it works though I agree that it would definitely increase readability
[15:02] <frankban> gary_poster: ok, I'll add a slack card to investigate that
