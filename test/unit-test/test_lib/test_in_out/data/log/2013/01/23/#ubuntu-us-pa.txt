[02:13] <rmg51> when will it all end?
[02:13] <rmg51> JonathanD: make it stop :P
[02:51] <rmg51> I guess we have this to look forward to all night :-/
[03:06] <pleia2> hopefully that will sort it
[03:16] <rmg51> that seems to have worked
[03:16] <rmg51> at least for the last 10 minutes
[10:40] <rmg51> Morning
[10:42] <JonathanD> Morning.
[12:23] <waltman> Morning.
[12:24] <jedijf> Morning.
[13:07] <teddy-dbear> Morning peoples
[16:24] <InHisName> morning again
[17:26] <ChinnoDog> morning happens every day
[17:33] <teddy-dbear> not if you sleep through it :-[
[17:40] <InHisName> afternoon, gents
[18:08] <ChinnoDog> I'm pretty sure morning happens even if you aren't awake for it.
[18:38] <Samuraialba> good bacon to all and to all some good bacon!
[18:39] <waltman> mmm, bacon
[18:39] <Samuraialba> How is everything going?
[18:39] <waltman> I'm lacking bacon.
[18:48] <Samuraialba> You need to go get some
[19:18] <MutantTurkish> so... If I inherited a linux desktop with a password ....
[19:18] <MutantTurkish> can I get access to it?
[19:19] <mn2010> we are all lacking proper amounts of bacon
[19:19] <mn2010> yes
[19:19] <mn2010> there is cracking tools for gnu-linux
[19:19] <mn2010> but it needs to have sshd or a unprivilaged account to access from a tty
[19:22] <waltman> "inherited" :)
[19:24] <MutantTurkish> neither
[19:25] <MutantTurkish> worse case scenario is that I just boot a live cd, and do a chroot right?
[19:26] <MutantTurkish> or just look at the guys stuff and wipe it out?
[19:29] <ChinnoDog> I don't understand the goal MutantTurkish. Are you trying to get access to his stuff or just repurpose the desktop?
[19:29] <jedijf> MutantTurkish: boot single user
[19:30] <jedijf> MutantTurkish: change boot line init=/bin/sh
[19:30] <jedijf> MutantTurkish: physical acees is ownership
[19:30] <jedijf> acess too - merhaba
[19:30] <jedijf> access
[19:30] <jedijf> 3
[19:32] <jedijf> look then wipe - that's what i usually do
[19:32] <jedijf> everytime i dont look, i wonder what i've missed
[19:33] <MutantTurkish> right on
[19:33] <MutantTurkish> or could I just gain access and use?
[19:33] <MutantTurkish> I mean... it's already setup with squeeze
[19:33] <MutantTurkish>  where do I add the init?
[19:33] <MutantTurkish> on the end of linux /asdjfsajflksf or the end of initrd asdfjsadfjsadf
[19:34] <MutantTurkish> jedijf: ^
[19:35] <jedijf> google it
[19:35] <jedijf> linux though
[19:35] <jedijf> haha
[19:35] <jedijf> what distro though single is easiest if non ubu
[19:36] <mn2010> im assuming they were smart enough to ENCRYPT there storage or use LVM... that makes chroot or switching shell pointless
[19:36] <MutantTurkish> mn2010: would you bother to do that?
[19:37] <MutantTurkish> jedijf: and my keyboard is ix'd when I do htat... I guess usb support kicks in later?
[19:38] <jedijf> MutantTurkish: bios
[19:39] <jedijf> or add usb in kernel line
[19:39] <jedijf> or ps2
[19:39] <jedijf> or look for 'recovery' or single user
[19:41] <jedijf> try single instead of init=.....
[19:41] <jedijf> if single or recovery not present
[19:42] <MutantTurkish> single user prompts for root passwd
[19:42] <jedijf> k, then init=
[19:42] <MutantTurkish> init= what?
[19:42] <jedijf> find ps2 or turn on usb in bios
[19:42] <MutantTurkish> sorry I am feeling sluggish
[19:42] <jedijf> init=/bin/sh
[19:42] <MutantTurkish> ther is no ps2 port.
[19:42] <jedijf> bios
[19:42] <MutantTurkish> k
[19:43] <MutantTurkish> the weird thing is that the keyboard works up until I boot
[19:43] <MutantTurkish> but I can edit grub and all
[19:43] <jedijf> that is odd
[19:43] <MutantTurkish> maybe I can manually specify the drivers/
[19:43] <MutantTurkish> ?
[19:46] <jedijf> MutantTurkish: you can
[19:46] <MutantTurkish> how? google is being a bastard
[19:46] <MutantTurkish> jedijf:what about chrooting in?
[19:53] <jedijf> insmod in grub iirc
[19:53] <MutantTurkish> insmod only works with grubs modules:/
[19:53] <MutantTurkish> you can specify video drivers
[19:53] <MutantTurkish> well it's a known kernel  bug
[19:53] <MutantTurkish> so I think I'll just poke around during the livcd
[19:54] <jedijf> you can do that too
[19:56] <MutantTurkish> works out the same I suppose
[20:18] <MutantTurkish> yeesh specrtwm with xrandr is scary
=== InHisName1 is now known as HowdyDoody
[20:24] <ChinnoDog> I ordered a refurbished drive from NewEgg last night. I hope it is not junk.
[20:24] <MutantTurkish> ChinnoDog: good luckl
[20:25] <ChinnoDog> WD 1.5GB with 64MB cache for $62.99.
[20:28] <MutantTurkish> ?
[20:28] <MutantTurkish> what....
[20:28] <MutantTurkish> 1.5Tb right?
[20:28] <MutantTurkish> eeek the debian installer won't even let me mount it
[20:38] <MutantTurkish> grrr
[20:40] <MutantTurkish> it's like arguing with a child!
[20:43] <MutantTurkish> except this child is debian
[20:45] <MutantTurkish> is there a way to tell if it's encrypted? I can't seem to mount any of this stuff
[20:48] <ChinnoDog> If you are using hardware based full disk  encryption then the disk needs a password. Your BIOS would have to support FDE.
[20:48] <ChinnoDog> If it is using software encryption then idk
[20:50]  * waltman notes that this is why he doesn't use FDE :)
[20:53] <ChinnoDog> FDE seems good in principle
[20:54] <ChinnoDog> It certainly makes life easier when it works. No software encryption necessary and no performance degredation.
[20:55] <ChinnoDog> And no need to wipe disks before disposing of them.
[20:55] <ChinnoDog> Well, I guess that isn't really true. There is the secure erase command to use for that though.
[20:57] <waltman> I just get scared about losing a password, or that standard diagnostic tools/methods might not work.
[20:57] <ChinnoDog> With hardware FDE the diagnostic tools are unaware of the encryption. They will all work
[20:57] <ChinnoDog> With software encryption you have to jump through hoops
[21:43] <MutantTurkish> nice I'm in
[21:44] <MutantTurkish> now I just need to copy all this junk to my own usb drive...
[21:44] <MutantTurkish> but my usb drive is where my system is currently operating from.
[21:44] <MutantTurkish> sadjfa'sg
[21:46] <jedijf> oh MutantTurkish congrats on the job - now you need *the* book - formerly pink, now purple - pleia2 what's the exact title?
[21:46] <MutantTurkish> thank you
[21:46] <pleia2> admin.com
[21:46] <pleia2> it's <3 <3
[21:51] <MutantTurkish> thanks
[21:51] <MutantTurkish> highly recommended?
[21:51] <MutantTurkish> 45 bucks...
[21:54] <MutantTurkish> is there a good program that I can use to visually inspect my servers
[21:54] <MutantTurkish> have several servers, i'd like a nice big GUI to say "yes everythngs ok!"
[21:54] <MutantTurkish> xcowsay "Don't Panic"
[21:55] <pleia2> it's the best book
[21:56] <MutantTurkish> good! I'll put it on my list
[21:56]  * ChinnoDog takes note
[21:56] <MutantTurkish> jedijf: I am in....
[21:56] <MutantTurkish> time to download all his stuff and sort through it
[21:58] <MutantTurkish> ahh it's like a 8 gig tarball arleady.
[21:58] <ChinnoDog> Why are you rifling through his stuff?
[22:00] <ChinnoDog> note to self: do not give MutantTurkish hard drives that have not been zeroed out
[23:12] <jedijf> human nature..why why
[23:15] <waltman> http://www.flickr.com/photos/85201403@N00/8408786727/
[23:16] <pleia2> :(
[23:18] <waltman> it almost caught fire :)
[23:18] <pleia2> I bet!
[23:18] <jedijf> waltman: http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/f2d6/?cpg=50851246&msg_id=50851246&et_rid=523162386&linkid=50851246_text_f2d6
[23:18] <waltman> the UPS was beeping most angrily
[23:19] <waltman> jedijf: huh
[23:20] <jedijf> you like the sauce - everyone likes chocolate
[23:20] <waltman> but I'm not sure of the combination...
[23:21] <jedijf> seems better then the bacon chocolate sauce
[23:21] <pleia2> spicy chocolate is all the rage
[23:21] <waltman> but garlicy spicy chocolate?
[23:22] <pleia2> maybe!
[23:22] <pleia2> I thought we were getting over bacon madness, but then I went to a place that had bacon lobster mac&cheese
[23:22] <pleia2> why would you do that?!
[23:23] <pleia2> ruin perfectly good lobster mac&cheese
[23:27] <jedijf> pleia2: that seems like a win
[23:27] <jedijf> is this marriage thing interfering with that combo?
[23:27] <pleia2> it's very american to take it that far :)
[23:28] <pleia2> well, lobster would already be off the table
[23:28] <jedijf> true
[23:28] <jedijf> but that's a less followed jawn
[23:28] <pleia2> but we're serving steak and scallops at our wedding, so I don't know what we do :)
[23:28] <pleia2> just no pork
[23:28] <jedijf> see, the scallops wrapped in da pork are common and why i said the other seemed like a natural
[23:28] <pleia2> we asked the rabbi doing the ceremoney if he needed a kosher meal and he was like "ahahaha, kosher."
[23:28] <pleia2> well ok
[23:28] <pleia2> :)
[23:29] <jedijf> ham hoagies
[23:29] <jedijf> \o/
[23:29] <pleia2> I never really cared for ham
[23:29] <pleia2> I do miss pepperoni, but pizza in general is pretty much off my pre-wedding diet anywya
[23:29] <jedijf> they have turkey everything now anyway
[23:30] <pleia2> mostly yeah
[23:32] <jedijf> i was at the new andy's around the corner from mj's grandmoms old spot and the turkey sausage inventory was double the pork
[23:32] <jedijf> today
[23:32] <waltman> aren't scallops technically 'shellfish'?
[23:33] <pleia2> yes
[23:33] <jedijf> see
[23:33] <waltman> I don't judge :)
[23:33] <jedijf> kosher rules are like this: shrimp is shellfish; shrimps aren't
[23:33] <pleia2> we thought about doing things properly dietary-wise at the wedding, but since we just do "no pork" we decided that's the only rule we'll follow for this too
[23:34] <pleia2> also, I love boiling animals in their mother's milk, so...
[23:34] <pleia2> mmm cheesesteaks
[23:34] <jedijf> and it can make you crazy....like pumpkin..is it parve...
[23:34] <pleia2> passover is hard
[23:34] <jedijf> matzah meal sucks and explodes
[23:35] <pleia2> it's ok if you cover it with cheese
[23:35] <jedijf> so glad i don't do passover cakes(if you want to call them that) anymore
[23:35] <jedijf> even though it was big money, until the supermarkets killed the margin and really, is there a good passover cake?
[23:35] <pleia2> no
[23:36] <jedijf> every 3 or so years, i lie to myself and try again because the names are enticing
[23:36] <waltman> So anyway, we had 4 computers running at 100% and sucking around 500W each, all going through that one power strip.
[23:37] <jedijf> waltman: no fuses on those belkins?
[23:37] <waltman> We were wondering the same thing!
[23:38] <pleia2> actually amazing that sort of thing doesn't happen more often
[23:38] <jedijf> yeah power strips are the new outlet octopus
[23:38] <jedijf> but makes everyone feel better
[23:39] <waltman> We were basically using one of the strips as an extension cord into the second one, which was plugged into the wall.
[23:39] <jedijf> that's a fire code violation
[23:39] <waltman> (we're rewiring things tomorrow)
[23:39]  * jedijf has been cited
[23:39] <pleia2> jedijf: otherwise known as "good idea at the time"
[23:39] <jedijf> codes shmodes
[23:40] <jedijf> can't even use an extension cord to a strip
[23:40] <jedijf> strip to wall
[23:40] <jedijf> hmmm
[23:41] <jedijf> waltman: well thanks, now i won't get mad when i get cited
[23:41] <jedijf> he doesn't even cite me anymore, just shakes his head
[23:43]  * waltman notes that he let the electrical engineering grad students in his lab design the wiring :)
[23:43] <jedijf> it does seem like double protection - assuming they were fuse protected
[23:44] <waltman> We were 200W over spec
[23:46] <jedijf> did equip get fried or just the outlet strip
[23:49] <waltman> just the strip.
[23:49] <jedijf> so that's a win
[23:51] <waltman> nod
[23:52] <waltman> the computers were running off a ups
[23:52] <waltman> it was mainly the ups that was sucking up the juice
[23:52] <waltman> UPSs
