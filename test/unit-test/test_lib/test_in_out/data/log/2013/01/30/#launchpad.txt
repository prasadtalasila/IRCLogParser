[01:52] <zma> hey, I just pushed something to launchpad with whoami information I don't want to disclose. How can I remove the latest revision totally?
[01:54] <StevenK> bzr push -r -2 --overwrite , I think
[01:54] <wgrant> That will just remove it from branch history
[01:54] <wgrant> It will still be retrievable from the repository if someone really tries
[01:56] <wgrant> zma: Can you delete the branch from Launchpad, or is it trunkish so not really deletable?
[01:56] <zma> wgrant: it's trunkish, I've got some 18 revisions there
[01:57] <zma> wgrant: is the whoami info sticky in committed revision, or can it be separately altered?
[01:57] <wgrant> zma: OK, so it might be best to get your local branch into a state without the bad data, then use SFTP to rename the .bzr on Launchpad to backup.bzr, then push the branch again using bzr push --use-existing-dir. Once you've confirmed that the branch on Launchpad still works, you can remove backup.bzr to get rid of the bad whoami.
[01:57] <wgrant> It can't be altered after the revision is committed.
[01:58] <wgrant> (without rewriting the history of the branch)
[01:58] <wgrant> Using something like bzr-fastimport
[01:58] <zma> I see

[19:44] <verte_> hey guys. when you subscribe a team to a branch on a proprietary project. Shouldn't that group have access to the branch?
[19:44] <verte_> (with sharing: some)
[19:52] <verte_> very odd
[21:52] <wgrant> verte_: If it's a stacked branch then you need to ensure that they also have access to the branch that it's stacked on
[21:52] <wgrant> They won't be able to see it without the data from the stacked branch.
[21:52] <wgrant> Er, from the stacked-on branch
