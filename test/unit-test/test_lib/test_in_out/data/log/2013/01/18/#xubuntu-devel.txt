[09:39] <knome> bluesabre, is the new xfce4-settings in raring, or do we need some ppa/git magic for that too?
[10:41] <knome> bluesabre, do you realize how much libs people need to install in order to be able to build parole?
[10:52]  * astraljava checks to see whether he has bluesabre on ignore.
[10:53] <knome> WOOT
[10:53] <knome> "configuration finished"
[10:54] <knome> oh, making failed
[10:54] <knome> what a surprise
[10:55] <bluesabre> knome, we're using *buntu
[10:55] <bluesabre> sudo apt-get build-dep parole
[10:56] <bluesabre> sudo apt-get install gtk-doc-tools
[10:56] <knome> bluesabre, you serious that works? :P
[10:56] <bluesabre> :D
[10:56] <bluesabre> ideally
[10:56] <bluesabre> if not
[10:56]  * bluesabre hides
[10:57] <knome> well THANKS
[10:57] <knome> ;)
[10:57] <bluesabre> why did the make fail?
[10:58] <knome> i lacked some dependencies, though configuring didn't whine about that
[10:58] <bluesabre> I should probably fix that or something
[10:58] <knome> it was about libnotify
[10:59] <knome> ok, now it built
[10:59] <knome> what about the warnings about some missing .m4 file and missing config.sub/.guess?
[11:01] <knome> where do we have the bin or should one 'make install' ?
[11:03] <bluesabre> after make, the bin is in src/parole
[11:04] <bluesabre> or make install is good too
[11:04] <knome> i'd rather not do that
[11:04] <knome> if not necessary
[11:05] <bluesabre> if you don't do the make install, I think it looks in the wrong place for the background image/icons
[11:05] <bluesabre> but everything else should work
[11:05] <knome> right
[11:11] <knome> ha!!!
[11:11] <knome> sudo apt-get build-dep catfish didn't install all dependencies
[11:12] <bluesabre> :'(
[11:12] <knome> python-distutils-extra is lacking
[11:12] <knome> but it's very clearly indicated
[11:12] <bluesabre> yeah, the experimental branch uses quickly
[11:12] <bluesabre> sudo apt-get install quickly should get everything
[11:13] <bluesabre> I need to document more
[11:13] <bluesabre> :)
[11:13] <knome> well it definitely seems to get *everything*
[11:13] <knome> would it install the aforementioned package as well?
[11:14] <knome> "sudo apt-get install python-distutils-extra quickly" looks a bit funny
[11:14] <knome> "sudo apt-get remove vlc slowly"
[11:14] <bluesabre> :)
[11:15] <bluesabre> yeah quickly should pull in the distutils stuff
[11:15] <knome> setup.py is cranky.
[11:15] <knome> looks like i need zeitgeist
[11:15] <knome> that's not installed either
[11:17] <knome> so... what should i do with the catfish sources?
[11:17] <knome> or does one need to build it?
[11:17] <bluesabre> go into the directory and do 'quickly run' or 'bin/catfish'
[11:18] <knome> oh, ok
[11:18] <knome> problems ahead
[11:18] <knome> couldn't connet to accessibility bus
[11:18] <knome> +c
[11:18] <knome> do i even need to install catfish build-deps then?
[11:19] <knome> or python-zeitgeist
[11:19] <bluesabre> probably not
[11:19] <bluesabre> python-zeitgeist is optional
[11:20] <knome> anyway, catfish isn't running for me
[11:22] <bluesabre> :(
[11:22] <knome> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1544817/
[11:24] <bluesabre> thanks knome, you found a bug which lead me to a fix  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alacarte/+bug/1086369
[11:24] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1086369 in alacarte (Ubuntu) "alacarte crashed with ImportError in /usr/share/alacarte/Alacarte/util.py : cannot import name GError" [Medium,Triaged]
[11:25] <knome> heh :)
[11:25] <knome> np
[11:25] <knome> so will you fix the repository?
[11:26] <bluesabre> yup, just a sec
[11:26] <knome> yup, np
[11:27] <bluesabre> pushed
[11:29] <knome> ok, it runs now
[11:29] <bluesabre> yay!
[11:30] <knome> is there something specific you want people to test?
[11:32] <bluesabre> make sure all files are found, it doesn't crash, filters work, right-click menu items work (though I just found a bug where its not getting permissions correctly for deleting)
[11:32] <bluesabre> I guess its also good to make sure the program is responsive
[11:32] <bluesabre> previously, it would lock up a lot for a long time, that should now be mostly fixed
[11:35] <knome> oki
[11:36] <knome> i think i'll leave the rest for later
[11:36] <knome> i'm thinking we should simply create testcases for these
[11:36] <knome> because the instructions are loooong
[11:38] <bluesabre> instructions?
[11:38] <bluesabre> sudo apt-get install quickly
[11:38] <knome> and bzr branch lp:...
[11:38] <bluesabre> bzr branch lp:catfish-search/experimental
[11:38] <knome> i didn't say they are like novel long
[11:38] <bluesabre> lol
[11:39] <knome> but they pile up when you have several of them
[11:39] <bluesabre> true
[11:39] <knome> and then somebody has the other code in git, the other in bzr, and the third app in a ppa
[11:39] <knome> O:)
[11:39] <bluesabre> fair enough
[11:59] <bluesabre> knome, pushed some fixes for catfish since you motivated me
[11:59] <bluesabre> :)
[11:59] <bluesabre> bbl
[11:59] <knome> hehe, good

[12:10] <mr_pouit> knome: you know that parole is in the xfce-4.12 ppa (precise and quantal)
[12:10] <knome> mr_pouit, i don't.
[12:10] <mr_pouit> (I mean, if you're not happy building it from source :P)
[12:10] <knome> now i do.
[12:10] <knome> it's not about me being happy or not
[12:10] <knome> it's for the testers
[12:10] <knome> what about the latest catfish then? any chances getting that in a ppa too?
[12:11] <knome> the more we can get into ppa's, the better..
[12:11] <mr_pouit> in the 4.12 ppa you have: the new exo/thunar/parole/mousepad/tumbler/xfce4-terminal releases
[12:11] <mr_pouit> and the latest dev release of xfce4-settings
[12:11] <knome> but those aren't going to be in R, are they?
[12:11] <mr_pouit> they are already in the r archive
[12:11] <knome> aha
[12:12] <mr_pouit> (except xfce4-settings)
[12:17] <knome> bbl.
[12:18] <bluesabre> I'll get the new catfish into a ppa this weekend, knome
[12:18] <bluesabre> if that makes it easier on everyone
