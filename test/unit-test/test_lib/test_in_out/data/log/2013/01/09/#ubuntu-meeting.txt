[16:10] <cjwatson> Caught up on archive removals a bit.
[16:10] <cjwatson> Sorted out most of the tail-end of the opencv transition by way of a messy gluegen2/armhf build fix.  Need to do something similar to libjogl2-java.
[16:10] <cjwatson> Working on backporting support for :any and :native build-dependencies to the Debian buildds, so that we stop having to carry such things as Ubuntu deltas.
[16:10] <cjwatson> ..
[16:10] <ogra_> heh, sawfish still has users ?
[16:11] <doko> cjwatson, did kmod need anything besides dropping b-d's?

[16:11]  * xnox doesn't even know what sawfish is =) i think i should be glad.
[16:11] <cjwatson> xnox: a WM
[16:11] <ev> - Very short week. Holiday until Friday, then off again on Monday.
[16:11] <ev> - Continuing to get the charms ready for prodstack, battling Canonistack every step of the way.
[16:11] <ev>   - Waiting to hear back if we still have an EC2 credit as we desperately need to expand the number of retracers (we're getting a lot more core files) and we can't do that until we have everything on prodstack.
[16:11] <ev> (done)
[16:11] <cjwatson> ogra_: evidence suggests at least two :-)
[16:11] <ogra_> ev ?!?!
[16:11] <ev> hm?
[16:12] <ogra_> thats a record in shortness
[16:12] <cjwatson> doko: I suspect perl:native would have done too once it's supported, but it wasn't necessary
[16:12] <ev> heh
[16:12] <doko> - getting the buildd chroot nearly cross-built
[16:12] <doko> - updating cross toolchain packages, trying to eliminate more ad hoc solutions
[16:13] <doko> - some test rebuild fixes and give-backs
[16:13] <doko> ..

[16:13] <ogra_> todo:
[16:13] <ogra_>  * discuss livefs builder situation with infinity (we need to start building nx7 images for flavours, that will need some cut down in buildtime or more builders)
[16:13] <ogra_>  * move nx7 images to xz compression (and probably move compressing from livefs builder to nusakan)
[16:13] <ogra_>  * fix plymouth vs console-setup racing somehow
[16:13] <ogra_>  * package tegra3 gstreamer codecs for raring

[16:14] <barry> looked into claws-m-p-e build failures when syncing from debian: libgdata/libcurl4-{gnutls,nss}-dev mess kills us again.  bug 1095407.  bug 1077087.  bug 1077089. upstream oauthlib issue 86.  py3 porting: lazr.smtptest, lazr.delegates, lazr.config (inprogress).  evaluating pillow (friendly PIL port for py3).  helped with a few lp:friends issues. started looking at mvo's sqlite fts branches for software-center (hopefully to drop xapian

[16:16] <xnox> barry: what's speed comparison of sqlite vs xapian for software-center use case? i hope that incremental indexing is faster.
[16:16] <barry> xnox: i don't know that yet ;)
[16:16] <barry> i'd be happy if it was in the same ballpark
[16:17] <xnox> ah. I takes quite a chunk of installation time to generate software-center index.... /me even considered having initial index in the package *gasp*
[16:18] <doko> barry: I already have pillow packaging
[16:19] <barry> doko: yeah, i saw that comment.  please provide url.  (my packaging isn't meant to be definitive, just enough to evaluate upstream)
[16:20] <barry> doko: i build from a github pull request which is fixing py3 issues

=== meetingology changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: bugs
[16:25] <cjwatson> anything we should be looking at this week that we aren't already?
[16:26] <bdmurray> bug 1078810 regarding quantal had a recent comment that allowed me to recreate the bug (most of the time)
[16:26] <ubottu> bug 1078810 in usb-creator (Ubuntu) "usb-creator-helper crashed with ImportError in __main__: No module named 'gobject'" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1078810
[16:26] <xnox> interesting!
[16:26] <bdmurray> er, whoops
[16:26] <bdmurray> yes, that's a bug we should look but my comment was about another bug
[16:26] <cjwatson> oh dear, missing pygi porting
[16:28] <barry> dang
[16:28]  * xnox will look into it.
[16:28] <xnox> helper script is small
[16:29] <bdmurray> okay, thanks xnox
[16:29] <bdmurray> my comment regarding being able to recreate a usb-creator bug on quantal was about bug 915626
[16:29] <ubottu> bug 915626 in usb-creator (Ubuntu Quantal) "usb-creator-gtk crashed with SIGSEGV" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/915626
[16:29] <xnox> still good =)
[16:31] <bdmurray> I'd test it raring but…
[16:31] <cjwatson> But it's completely screwed due to the prior bug? :)
[16:32] <bdmurray> right
[16:33] <xnox> =)))))))
[16:33] <cjwatson> xnox: can you take 915626 as well, then?
[16:33] <xnox> i guess i win both =)
[16:33] <bdmurray> It seems like we should look at reviewing the branch associated with bug 1095692 for the 12.04 point release
[16:33] <ubottu> bug 1095692 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Hide the 'back' button on the first page of oem-user-config" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1095692

[16:34] <xnox> that's not merged into raring yet ?!
[16:35] <cjwatson> bdmurray: assigned to me, prodded bug metadata
[16:35] <bdmurray> okay, thanks
[16:36]  * xnox has .changes ready to make ubiquity upload into raring. Can I still do it (to test if partman fixes resolve hangs) or cjwatson you'll do an upload today?
[16:36] <bdmurray> Then I'm curious how worthwhile is it to SRU bug 1078544.
[16:36] <ubottu> bug 1078544 in aptdaemon (Ubuntu Quantal) "python-aptdaemon: upgrading marks auto-installed packages as manual" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1078544

[16:37] <cjwatson> xnox: no need to block on me, I can put it in the next version along if I need to
=== amithkk is now known as mechanobot
[16:37] <xnox> ack.
[16:38] <cjwatson> I suspect that infinity would still like to sort out that aptdaemon bug, based on his comments about kernel autoremoval; it might be worth asking him
[16:38] <cjwatson> oh, which reminds me, infinity sent apologies, but:
[16:38] <cjwatson> 12:39 <infinity> cjwatson: The only real point of interest from me is glibc_2.17 that should be landing when the test rebuild is done (about half done rebasing all the patches for experimental, then the Ubuntu
[16:38] <cjwatson>                  merge will be trivial on top of that)
[16:39] <cjwatson> bdmurray: anything else?
[16:40] <bdmurray> xnox: did you have any luck with the kernel and testing bug 1023645?
[16:40] <ubottu> bug 1023645 in ndiswrapper (Ubuntu Quantal) "ndiswrapper-dkms 1.57-1ubuntu1: ndiswrapper kernel module failed to build [error: ‘struct kernel_stat’ has no member named ‘cpustat’]" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1023645

[16:41] <xnox> (people i know tend to choose hardware for ubuntu though)
