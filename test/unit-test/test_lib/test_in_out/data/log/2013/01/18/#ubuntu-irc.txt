[01:22] <Unit193> Pici: Ping?  PM?
[01:23] <Pici> Unit193: pong, I forgot about it.
[01:23] <Pici> Whats the account again?
[01:23] <Pici> Sorry, its been a busy day ;)
[01:24] <Unit193> Pici: Was wondering if it'd be an issue.
[01:25] <Pici> Unit193: Is there anywhere else that bot is active?
[01:25] <Unit193> Yes, but you'll notice I'm not asking for an ubuntu cloak.
[01:26] <Pici> Unit193: Oh. I misread.
[01:27] <Pici> No issue for it having a different cloak then.
[01:27] <Unit193> Didn't think there was.
[01:43] <Unit193> Got it done.
