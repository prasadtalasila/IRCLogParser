[14:06] <zyga> retoaded: hi
[14:06] <retoaded> zyga, greetings
[14:06] <zyga> retoaded: I have a few things to talk to but I'm busy in a meeting
[14:07] <retoaded> zyga, np. ping me when you are ready
[14:07] <zyga> retoaded: I'd like to know if we could somehow get the same kind of automation as unity for landing branches
[14:07] <zyga> retoaded: and also, I seem to have issues with connecting from various machines
[14:07] <zyga> retoaded: for example: http://10.97.5.22:8080/job/checkbox-unit-tests/
[14:07] <zyga> retoaded: all of the failures are related to network, it's strange, I could use your help
[14:08] <retoaded> zyga, ack
[14:08] <zyga> retoaded: also, lastly, we'd like to get a public instance so that people can just go and see that
[14:09] <zyga> retoaded: but that's probably something that we can talk about later, in the scope of getting the standard CI loop like what unity folks showed
[14:10] <zyga> retoaded: I was talking to some people and the tools are there but they are apparently stuck in private code repos
[14:10] <retoaded> zyga, the last one is probably the easiest. Once the test(s) is(are) set up and running we can set them to publish to the public jenkins instance.
=== Ursinha-afk is now known as Ursinha
[15:52] <zyga> retoaded: so I have a moment now
[15:52] <zyga> retoaded: have you managed to learn anything about networking fails on those machines?
[15:54] <retoaded> zyga, haven't dug into it too deeply yet; got drawn into another issue. Starting to dig back into it now.
[15:56] <retoaded> zyga, if I'm reading the console output correctly the git clone process was running on the master node
[15:57] <retoaded> and failing
[16:02] <zyga> retoaded: this is something I don't fully understand, it clones/checkouts on the master
[16:02] <zyga> retoaded: then triggerts all the matrix jobs
[16:02] <zyga> retoaded: but those clone again? WTF?
[16:03] <retoaded> zyga, idk
[16:03] <zyga> retoaded: that's not really testing the same stuff anymore
[16:03] <zyga> retoaded: what I understand less is why some of those fail
[16:03] <zyga> retoaded: could that be DNS issue on some of them?
[16:03] <zyga> retoaded: (ideally they would just reuse master then we don't have any problem with this)
[16:03] <retoaded> possibly, will check that amoung other things
[16:09] <zyga> retoaded: do you know who has configured the unity CI stack by any chance?
[16:10] <retoaded> PS, I would suggest checking with mmrazik or thomi

[20:05] <letozaf_> hi balloons, wow! you were quik!
[20:05] <letozaf_> balloons, howzit ?
[20:05] <balloons> i just happened to be here
[20:05] <balloons> :-)
[20:05] <balloons> good
[20:05] <balloons> wanted to share on thing with you
[20:05] <letozaf_> balloons, sure! I was joking as I always do
[20:05] <letozaf_> balloons, yes tell me
[20:06] <balloons> have a look here: /usr/share/doc/python-autopilot/html/index.html
[20:06] <balloons> it has the full docs, unlike the site
[20:06]  * letozaf_ is looking at the site
[20:07]  * dkessel waves
[20:08] <letozaf_> hello dkessel :)
[20:08] <Noskcaj> balloons, i've made a very basic transmission testcase, can someone make it an auto? while i would like to make some transmission will be rather big.
[20:08] <balloons> Noskcaj, ohh
[20:08] <balloons> look it's a party
[20:08] <balloons> I have a surprise for everyone
[20:08] <dkessel> hey letozaf_ :)
[20:08] <letozaf_> dkessel, hey
[20:09] <dkessel> oh, another fine ASCII balloon?
[20:09] <letozaf_> balloons, looks good
[20:11] <letozaf_> balloons, but it's on our filesystem, right ?
[20:11] <letozaf_> balloons, super :)
[20:11] <balloons> letozaf_, yes on your filesystem
[20:11] <balloons> the site willbe fixed at some point
[20:12] <balloons> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual-tests
[20:14] <balloons> that my friends is the manual testcases.. they've been pulled out and committed
[20:15] <letozaf_> balloons, these are the same ones as on the iso, package and laptop tracker, but they are all together
[20:15] <balloons> so Noskcaj you can branch and commit your transmission test to the project
[20:15] <balloons> yes, so now we can have anyone contribute manual tests.. and do so easily
[20:15] <balloons> and you can view them a bit easier too ;-)
[20:15] <balloons> I wrote a script to pull and push the tests.. so I'll keep things in sync
[20:16] <letozaf_> balloons, looks like a very good idea, looks practical and quick
[20:17] <Noskcaj> my testcase is at http://paste.ubuntu.com/1567084/
[20:18] <dkessel> i'll give that a look when i'm on my developer machine again :)
[20:18] <balloons> Noskcaj, do you know how to use lp?
[20:18] <Noskcaj> as you can see, it's only dot points
[20:18] <Noskcaj> balloons, nope
[20:18] <balloons> if not, let's get you setup right now
[20:18] <balloons> if you have a moment
[20:18] <balloons> and we'll commit your test :-)
[20:18] <balloons> then you'll get some nice credit for it as well :-)
[20:18] <Noskcaj> :)
[20:20] <balloons> http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/latest/en/mini-tutorial/
[20:21] <balloons> sudo apt-get install bzr
[20:21] <balloons> then
[20:21] <balloons>  bzr branch lp:ubuntu-manual-tests
[20:21] <balloons> you can see that here: https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual-tests
[20:21] <Noskcaj> ok, downloading now
[20:22] <balloons> someone else was asking about htis.. I think I'll make a little tutorial after this, to help folks
[20:22] <balloons> granted, I'm a newbie to this as well, but ;-)
[20:23] <balloons> ok, once you've branched the code let me now
[20:23] <Noskcaj> i jut screwed up my install so much, sigh, back to square one
[20:23] <balloons> it will give you a copy of everything
[20:23] <letozaf_> balloons, I did ;) just for fun
[20:23] <balloons> then we'll add your file to it and commit it back
[20:24] <balloons> so the next step is to make the file on your machine
[20:24] <balloons> edit it as you'd like
[20:24] <balloons> and then bzr add MYFILENAME
[20:24] <balloons> finally, commit it using 'bzr commit'
[20:26] <balloons> if you've gotten that far, there's a few more steps then to push it back to lp and propose it as a merge.. meaning, propose it to be included in the code
[20:27] <balloons> letozaf_, I know you know how to do this -- when/where did you learn it?
[20:28] <Noskcaj> i can get it to work, i will try again after i fix my desktop pc (broken gpu driver)
[20:30] <Noskcaj> *can't
[20:31] <letozaf_> balloons, cjohnston tought me for autopilot tests
[20:32] <balloons> Noskcaj, where's the trouble.. sorry to hear that
[20:32] <balloons> hang onto the test, we'll help you get it committed
[20:32] <balloons> though it's going to need to be updated to follow the format.. you should add expected results for your steps
[20:37] <Noskcaj> balloons, will do, the problem was i installed the fgrlx drive from synaptic and i killed x, fixed now
[20:38] <balloons> ahh
[20:41] <Noskcaj> the testcase will take me hours to finish properly, i have other stuff to do.
[21:08] <balloons> Noskcaj, no rush.. but getting it committed will help others help you work it too :-)
[21:10] <Noskcaj> balloons, i will try and commit my half finished version
=== salem_ is now known as _salem
[21:13] <Noskcaj> balloons, i'm up to bzr commit, what now?
[21:14] <balloons> ok excellent
[21:14] <balloons> does bzr status show the new file you added?
[21:14] <balloons> bzr status will show what you've modified
[21:14] <Noskcaj> i'm at the screen made by "bzr commit" it says it's added my testcase
[21:15] <balloons> ok, you give a commit message
[21:16] <balloons> then it will do the commit
[21:16] <balloons> did you get that far?
[21:17] <Noskcaj> yep
[21:18] <Noskcaj> it says: added:
[21:18] <Noskcaj>   testcases/packages/transmission_manual_testcase
[21:18] <Noskcaj> i'm confused as to what to do next
[21:19] <balloons> awesome
[21:19] <balloons> ok, so what's happened is your local vcs has the new files
[21:19] <balloons> you need to push it to lp
[21:21] <balloons> bzr launchpad-login USERNAME
[21:21] <Noskcaj> done
[21:22] <Noskcaj> how am i supposed to get out of the commit page BTW?
[21:24] <balloons> ctrl+0
[21:24] <balloons> ctrl+o
[21:29] <balloons> then run bzr whoami..
[21:29] <balloons> it should say jackson doak ;-)
[21:29] <balloons> if so, you can then push to the project
[21:30] <balloons> bzr push lp:~doak-jackson/ubuntu-manual-tests/WHATEVERYOUWANTTOCALLTHISBRANCH
[21:30] <balloons> if it's all good.. it will show up here; https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual-tests
[21:31] <balloons> that will allow you to ask for a merge then when your ready
[21:31] <dkessel> enough python learning for today... good night :)
[21:32] <balloons> dkessel, good night
[21:32] <balloons> Noskcaj, note you'll need the ssh key you have on lp
[21:32] <balloons> jackson@jackson-laptop
[21:33] <Noskcaj> balloons, that's an old one, does this mean i have to set up a new ssh key?

[21:41] <thomi> balloons: hey - how's it going?
[21:41] <balloons> thomi, hey
[21:41] <balloons> good.. pushing the last ap post out now
[21:42] <thomi> balloons: I have some spare time right now - thought I'd look into the problems you're having with lp:ubuntu_autopilot_tests
[21:42] <thomi> balloons: oooh - got a link?
[21:42] <balloons> gotcha..

[22:40] <balloons> :-)
[22:40] <balloons> the gedit introspection example is working, and the post is going live
[22:40] <balloons> in a few mins.. gotta double check things
[22:42] <balloons> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-testcase/ubuntu-autopilot-tests/trunk/view/head:/ubuntu_autopilot_tests/geditintrospection/test_geditintrospection.py
[22:43] <thomi> balloons: I can see a small issue you will want to fix
[22:43] <balloons> good.. I threw it together quickly, so I'd appreciate your feedback
[22:43] <thomi> line 29: your lambda function will always return the same thing. What you want is:
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
[22:44] <thomi> refresh_fn = lambda: len(self.app.select_many('GeditTab'))
[22:44] <thomi> self.assertTHat(refresh_fn, Eventually(Equals(2)))
[22:44] <thomi> otherwise you just retrieve 'documents' once, and run len() over it many times
[22:44] <balloons> hmm.. there could be a timing issue
[22:44] <balloons> yes I see
[22:45] <thomi> balloons: but other than that, it looks awesome. A nice demonstration for a number of different autopilot features as well
[22:49] <balloons> weird..
[22:50] <balloons> ImportError: Start directory is not importable:
[22:50] <balloons> oh..bother
[22:50] <balloons> I hate bzr
[22:59] <zyga> balloons: hey, any updates on the friendly story?
[22:59] <zyga> balloons: I have some updates from my end
[23:00] <balloons> excellent
[23:00] <balloons> cprofitt, ^^
[23:00] <zyga> balloons: so xml output will arrive in the next cycle (two weeks)
[23:00] <zyga> balloons: and I'll land most of the code from the friendly branch to trunk
[23:01] <zyga> balloons: I'll update / rebase the branch as we go to keep the delta small, so be wary of moving targets
[23:01] <zyga> balloons: I'd love to see some feedback on that though, I wonder if you can test it at all, in any way, before the .xml output is implemented
[23:04] <balloons> zyga, I am pretty booked this week, but I will find some time to help you out in the next couple weeks
[23:04] <knome> balloons, hey!
[23:04] <balloons> knome, hey hey
[23:04] <knome> isn't http://packages.qa.dev.stgraber.org/ the sandbox or am i completely lost?
[23:04] <balloons> knome, indeed
[23:04] <zyga> balloons: sure, I think that it will be actually more interesting in the next two weeks
[23:04] <balloons> but surprise
[23:04] <zyga> balloons: I'm just glad it's moving
[23:05] <knome> balloons, i don't like surprises ;)
[23:05] <balloons> knome what are you trying to do/
[23:05] <knome> balloons, i'm working on the xubuntu cadence testcases/testsuite, and i'd like to see how those look
[23:06] <balloons> knome, https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual-tests. We have an lp project now.. Ive not yet announced it yet..
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
[23:06] <knome> balloons, oh, i'm not talking about manual tests. is cadence specific to those?
[23:06] <balloons> but that means folks who aren't admins can actually contribute now. I've got a tool to sync stuff from the project to the tracker
[23:06] <balloons> knome, ohh.. then what type of tests
[23:06] <balloons> no cadence isn't specific to manual :-)
[23:07] <knome> balloons, just a normal testcase/testsuite which we are going to set up in iso.qa. when we're ready
[23:07] <balloons> knome, yes.. that's what the project is intended for
[23:07] <knome> balloons, but before publishing, i'd like to see how it looks, and not just the html
[23:07] <knome> right...
[23:07] <balloons> I mean, for you, being an admin you have the access to see stuff :-)
[23:08] <knome> i'm wondering if we're talking about the same thing
[23:08] <knome> let me try to start from the beginning
[23:08] <balloons> I'm just telling you because lp is becoming the master repository.. which means you need to make sure ultimately it ends up there
[23:08] <balloons> yes, we are knome ;-)
[23:09] <knome> i wrote a few testcases in  http://packages.qa.dev.stgraber.org/  and added them to a new testsuite
[23:09] <balloons> yep, got it
[23:09] <knome> how do i know what that testsuite looks like for the end-user when we push it to iso.qa. ?
[23:09] <balloons> ahh.. which testsuite did you add it to?
[23:10] <knome> a new testsuite called "Xubuntu Raring Cadence"
[23:10] <balloons> you can't push products, such you need myself, or re-use a testsuite that is visible
[23:10] <knome> if you could make that testsuite visible, that would be cool
[23:10] <balloons> basically, each product has a testsuite(s) defined
[23:10] <balloons> so if you make a new one, since you can't edit products, you won't see it :(
[23:10] <balloons> yes, I can
[23:10] <knome> yes, i understand that
[23:10] <balloons> ok good
[23:10] <knome> that's why i'm in this channel ;)
[23:11] <balloons> good work making them btw :-
[23:11] <knome> hehe, np
[23:11] <balloons> lol
[23:11] <balloons> ok ok
[23:11] <knome> how's the new format working?
[23:11] <balloons> excellent
[23:11] <balloons> I really like it and the tweaks youmade
[23:11] <knome> good!
[23:11] <knome> so one more question
[23:12] <knome> who can log in to packages.qa.dev. ?
[23:12] <balloons> just testcase admins team members
[23:12] <balloons> well. I mean anyone can
[23:13] <balloons> for test submissions
[23:13] <knome> right, that's good
[23:13] <balloons> http://packages.qa.dev.stgraber.org/qatracker/milestones/249/builds/27871/testcases
[23:13] <knome> so when i work on those testcases, i can tell people to log in and see if the testcases are what they expected
[23:13] <balloons> yes
[23:13] <knome> great, thanks!
[23:13] <balloons> fyi, we would normally put this in the download info
[23:13] <balloons> Before starting this test, you will need to enable a PPA and install MenuLibre from the PPA. To do this, run the following command in a terminal:
[23:13] <balloons> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:menulibre-dev/devel && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install menulibre
[23:14] <knome> and just to be sure, now that i add new testcases to that testsuite, they will be shown automatically?
[23:14] <knome> oh right.
[23:14] <knome> that's good to know
[23:14] <balloons> yes.. all your work you push into the testcase will show in realtime
[23:14] <knome> as it is, or is there a good example i can copy/paste?
[23:14] <balloons> but yea, again, sadly, you can't define product download info ;-(
[23:14] <balloons> an example.. sure
[23:14] <knome> heh, ok
[23:14] <knome> so...
[23:15] <balloons> so..
[23:15] <balloons> Prerequisites: Make sure you are running the latest version of SERIES <br>1) Update your system<br> <b>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unity && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</b><br>2) Restart your session (logout and log back in)
[23:15] <balloons> let's see
[23:15] <balloons> ohh a ppa version
[23:15] <knome> yeah
[23:16] <balloons> http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/228/builds/19413/downloads
[23:16] <knome> i'm expecting our testers are up-to-date on the release ;)
[23:16] <knome> mmh, ok
[23:16] <knome> but i can't do that myself?
[23:16] <balloons> also bug instructions are good, if needed
[23:16] <balloons> no, sadly..
[23:16] <balloons> arrgh
[23:16] <knome> ok
[23:16] <knome> is it too bad if we just have it in the description?
[23:16]  * balloons wonders if we can pull and expose that too
[23:16] <knome> :)
[23:17] <balloons> knome, that's how I've done it
[23:17] <balloons> feel free to run with it however you choose :-)
[23:17] <knome> ok
[23:17] <knome> i'll do it that way at least for now
[23:17] <knome> thanks!
[23:17] <balloons> yea..
[23:17] <balloons> for the moment, just leave it on top
[23:17] <knome> yup
[23:17] <balloons> when the migration happens, we'll just yank it out and put it in the right spot
[23:17] <knome> hehe, yeah
[23:18] <balloons> bugs instructions, if you wish, can also be added
[23:18] <knome> yup
[23:18] <balloons> and we'll put them in the right spot too
[23:18] <knome> i'll ask the developers
[23:21] <knome> one more thing
[23:21] <knome> could you add ~smd-seandavis to the testcase admins?
[23:21] <balloons> yes
[23:22] <balloons> one moment
[23:22] <knome> thanks!
[23:22] <balloons> done
[23:22] <knome> cheers
