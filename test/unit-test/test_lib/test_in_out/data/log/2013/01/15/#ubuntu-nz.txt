[01:36] <G> hads: oh yeah, just FYI, response from Intel basically read: "You have mentioned that you are using Linux for your DC3217IYE, please be informed thou that this kit currently do not support Linux."  and "Could you please try on Windows"
[01:43] <lifeless> G: hahaha.
[01:43] <lifeless> G: to which you replied 'YOU HAVE GOT TO BE SHITTING ME', right ?
[01:51] <ibeardslee> g<tab> >
[01:51] <ibeardslee> ?
[02:30] <olly> is rhythmbox the default media player?
[02:31] <olly> i know it used to be, but then wasn't, but I thought i'd heard it was again
[02:32] <olly> it's pretty reliably crashy in quantal for me, apparently because libcurl does dodgy things with longjmp(), and the default of fortify-source makes that fail
[02:33] <olly> with a LD_PRELOAD hack to turn off that, it seems to work much like it did in previous releases I used it in
[02:34] <olly> not found a bug in launchpad for it, but there are too many bugs open to really be sure
[02:35] <mwhudson> olly: i believe it's the default again, yes
[02:35] <ibeardslee> it was, they then moved to banshee and dropped banshee because it was mono based
[02:37] <lifeless> also terrible
[02:38] <mwhudson> i think the banshee switch was one of those "if we try it for a cycle, will you *please* just shut up?" things
[02:38] <lifeless> yeah
[02:38]  * ibeardslee has started using clementine
[02:38] <mwhudson> i mostly use spotify these days, because i hate freedom
[02:38]  * ajmitch still uses banshee
[02:39] <G> lifeless: actually, to tell the truth, I've got the perfect response, the way they worded it was: " Can you try to use Windows 7 or 8 and check if you will encounter the same problem?", so I'm thinking the appropriate response would be: "I tried to use Windows and it drove me insane"  - I don't have mSATA for it yet, and Windows in infinate wisdom, can't be installed to a USB HDD
[02:40] <lifeless> G: ha!
[02:40] <lifeless> G: another option would be to say 'if you give me a windows CD I will try t install it'
[02:41] <mwhudson> hee
[02:53] <olly> hmm, i wonder why there doesn't seem to be a bug for this open
[02:53] <olly> perhaps the bug search just sucks
[02:54]  * chilts uses cplay :)
[03:33] <hads> G: Ug.
[03:35] <hads> G: As an info point, I've had mine running for 24 hours with no issues. Plugged into a noname managed GigE swithc.
[03:35] <lifeless> olly: search for few but rare terms and it should work well fr you
[03:36] <G> hads: yeah, I'm pondering my next move on this for after work
[03:39] <olly> lifeless: i wasn't finding anything...
[03:39] <olly> though it seems from further digging since that the dependency on libcurl is indirect
[03:40] <olly> so maybe there's a bug filed on whatever pulls it in
[08:24] <Pikiora> Hello  :)  Anyone here? I have a question,  i know I know don't start by asking if you can ask a question >.<  Anyho
[08:25] <Pikiora> I have located a group of files sprinkled throughout my system which have the same file format,  now I want to copy them, can you do that in one big bunch via command line?  Or do I have do to it one by one?
[08:28] <Pikiora> I think I have it :D
[08:32] <Pikiora> ooooooooh...oops..
[08:41] <Pikiora> Don't try this at home :p  --->  strange things happened.   find / -name "*.mobi" -exec cp {} /pikiora/test \;
[08:41] <Pikiora> Luckily tomorrow is another day!  :D
[18:39] <ibeardslee> morning
[18:56] <chilts> morning
