[05:22] <m4n1sh> can anyone explain me this message?
[05:22] <m4n1sh> Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_calendar_select_month: assertion `month <= 11' failed
[05:22] <m4n1sh> 2012-12-31 is surely a valid date
[05:24] <m4n1sh> or does it need between 0 to 11?
[05:24] <m4n1sh> valadoc doesnt explain much
[05:25] <RAOF> It's likely 0-based; so 0 is January?
[05:25] <RAOF> And 11 would be December.
[05:25] <desrt> monthÂ :
[05:25] <desrt> a month number between 0 and 11.
[05:25] <desrt> quoth the docs
[05:26] <desrt> that's some serious silliness there
[05:26] <m4n1sh> ah. I was looking on valadocs. That hardly has anything
[05:26] <desrt> use the gtk-doc
[05:26] <m4n1sh> yeah. The day can be 1-31, but month needs to be 0-11
[05:27] <desrt> i'm all for 0-based counting, but that's a bit ridiculous
[05:27] <desrt> i could understand if there wasn't some overwhelming concensus on month numbering
[05:28] <m4n1sh> but atleast for calendar and datetime based classes, it would be better to follow the general convention
[05:28] <m4n1sh> python's datetime does not count from 0 but from 1
[05:28] <desrt> you don't even need to appeal to python
[05:29] <desrt> freakin' *G*Datetime uses 1 to 12
[05:29] <m4n1sh> now that is a big inconsistency
[05:29] <m4n1sh> converting all the time

[09:57] <chrisccoulson> good morning everyone
[09:57] <chrisccoulson> who's enjoying the snow? ;)
[09:58] <Laney> none here yet this morning :(
[10:00] <ritz> morning :)
[10:04] <chrisccoulson> Laney - we've got a little bit now
[10:04] <chrisccoulson> my daughter is quite happy http://www.flickr.com/photos/67705534@N06/8390975681/ ;)
[10:05] <Laney> hah
[10:05] <Laney> lucky it's still open ;)

[11:02] <ogra_> funny
[11:03] <Laney> in ogra_'s day they walked 15 miles in 5 mile deep snow
[11:03] <Laney> UPHILL BOTH WAYS!
[11:03] <czajkowski> and had no shoes!
[11:03] <ogra_> upwind too !
[11:04] <chrisccoulson> i still remember the days when school teachers managed to get to school in more than 1/2" of snow
[11:27] <xnox> ogra_: well, i wanted to say - i still can see pavement so it's only starting to snow....
[11:27] <ogra_> yeah
[11:31] <davmor2> ogra_: you have a folding shovel with you at all times for just such digging emergencies right :D
[11:32] <ogra_> heh, no, but i usually spend 1-1.5h shoveling per day during winter
[11:33] <ogra_> i would go out for something like above :)

[14:57] <pitti> ricotz: I am, thanks! how about yourself?

[15:30] <tkamppeter> Someone knows how to get hardware-accelerated graphics on the Pandaboard with Raring (I have a working 1920x1080 desktop now, but very slow).
[15:38] <ricotz> pitti, :)
[15:55]  * desrt wonders what the deal with fam is
[15:56] <desrt> it seems that we build our glib packages without fam support...
[16:00] <smspillaz> tkamppeter: even if you have a working 1920x1080 desktop with hardware acceleration it will be quite slow
[16:00] <smspillaz> tkamppeter: currently we use a technique on the desktop to reduce flickering to a minimum, but it effectively constitutes fill-rate abuse
[16:01] <smspillaz> hardware that is often fill-limited like the sgx does not cope very well with this
[16:01] <smspillaz> the solution is to wait until those drivers support something like EGL_EXT_buffer_age or something
[16:02] <smspillaz> sadly, there is not a whole lot of interest in implementing EGL_EXT_buffer_age on X11 because of some finer details about how redirection works
[16:29] <chrisccoulson> desrt, no, i've not been watching that bug. should i?
[16:30] <desrt> chrisccoulson: would be nice to finally see that fixed....
[16:49] <tkamppeter> smspillaz, thanks, so there will be no solution soon? Another things is video play acceleration which does not seem to work, playing a 1080p Youtube video with XBMC is too slow and xbmc.bin takes ~180% CPU, making the impression that the video is handled totally by software.

[17:20] <desrt> seb128: hey.  can we chat for a second about fam?
[17:21] <seb128> desrt, hey, sure, what about it?
[17:22] <desrt> seb128: we have some vague ideas to use fam to monitor files in gio if we detect NFS is in use
[17:22] <desrt> currently glib in ubuntu is not built against fam...
[17:26] <desrt> seb128: fwiw, the gio module that links against fam is built as a separate .so
[17:26] <desrt> seb128: perhaps it would be nice to build glib against fam but then split the fam module off into a separate package as not to pull fam into the base system...
[17:27] <desrt> then people who want to have reliable monitoring on NFS could install the module
[17:32] <seb128> desrt, it used to be like that, I need to check why it was turned off
[17:35] <desrt>   [ Josselin Mouette ]
[17:35] <desrt>   * Only build the libgio-fam package for hurd and kfreebsd, it is
[17:35] <desrt>     totally useless under Linux.
[17:36] <desrt> bad joss
[17:41] <desrt> seb128: k.  thanks for the pointer.  he said he'd turn it back on.

[23:53] <cyphermox> cody-somerville: pong
[23:54] <cody-somerville> cyphermox: Should LP #780602 be just about the memory leaks or about the functional issues with nm-applet? It doesn't appear the two are related.
[23:54] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 780602 in OEM Priority Project precise "nm-applet leaks memory and stops functioning after a while" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/780602
[23:55] <cody-somerville> cyphermox: The bug has mostly been focused on the memory leak issues but the SRU test case is for the "nm-applet becoming unresponsive to interactions and submenus showing an empty list" issue.
[23:56] <cyphermox> it's both
[23:56] <cyphermox> the leak fixes in nm-applet will help, then there needs to be fixes in dbusmenu
[23:57] <cyphermox> (or whatever similar library can't keep track of the menus when I update them)
[23:57] <cody-somerville> Cool. There's some confusion by users due to Jame's comment. He says he is marking it fixed release (though it appears he actually changed it from fix committed to confirmed).
[23:58] <cody-somerville> and then someone started unmarking duplicates because they interpreted that to mean the bug should only be about the memory leaks
