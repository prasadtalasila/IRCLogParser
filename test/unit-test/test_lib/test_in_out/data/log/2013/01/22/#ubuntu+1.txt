[21:19] <trism> jemadux: easiest way would be to reinstall 12.04 so it takes over grub (and be sure to install dev releases with ubiquity -b in the future so it doesn't overwrite the bootloader)
[21:20] <trism> jemadux: otherwise something like: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Reinstalling_GRUB_2_from_a_Working_System should work from 12.04
[21:23] <jtaylor> you hopefully mean reinstall 12.04 grub
[21:23] <jtaylor> you don't to reinstall a whole os to change boot ordering :)
[21:28] <trism> yes of course you could just change the order, but I'm not sure you really want the dev release owning grub if you want to run 12.04 most of the time
[21:30] <jtaylor> you can simply own it back from 12.04
[21:34] <trism> yes, reinstalling grub is the topic of the wiki link
