[13:03] <dddggg> hi, i recently got a new laptop with 10finger multitouch. after i installed ubuntu 12.10, it was working out of the box. if i am using unity, i am able to use some multitouch gestures for moving windows etc. With xfce this doesn't work. my question is: what software is responsible for that behaviour? is that compiz?

[14:54] <bregma> dddggg, window management is a function of the window manager:  unity supports window management with gestures, xfce does not

[16:14] <dddggg> do you know, if that's a plugin of which i can find&edit the source easily or is the touch functionality directly compiled into compiz?
[16:24] <bregma> dddggg, the gesture handling is in unity, not compiz, and the touch functionality comes from the X server through the geis API

[17:24] <dddggg> i want to develop a small application, which provides a menu bar, that is shown when i do a drag gesture beginning at an edge of the screen towards its center.  do you have a suggestion how to do this? is the best way modifying the unity source? or can i interface with geis to do this?
[17:28] <bregma> well, in theory you should just be able to use geis to do that, so long as the gestures you want are not already grabbed by the window manager
[17:34] <dddggg> it seems that you are right. if i try to use ginn, the function geis_subscribe() fails on unity, but works on xfce
[17:35] <bregma> unity grabs all 3- and 4-touch gestures on the root window
[17:35] <bregma> because they're window management gestires for unity
[17:37] <dddggg> do you know where this happens (which package or process)? i just downloaded the unity source package and grep'd for geis but couldn't find anything
[17:41] <bregma> I think it's wrapped in a Nux class
[17:58] <dddggg> yep, you are right. so i wont get arround editing the unity source code?
