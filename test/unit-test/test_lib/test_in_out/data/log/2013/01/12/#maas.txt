[04:57] <vysakh0> I was just thinking of deploying my app(rails) in amazon aws and I saw about maas today, sounds cool. I have too many doubts, can i shoot it now?
[19:04] <sartas> where i can download maas ephemeral images?
[19:04] <sartas> https://maas.ubuntu.com/images - pade not found
[19:04] <sartas> *page
[19:36] <AskUbuntu> can't download maas ephemeral images | http://askubuntu.com/q/240471
[21:25] <alperkanat> hey there.. i ran maas-import-isos command but when it tries to fetch https://maas.ubuntu.com/images/query/precise/ephemeral/released-dl.current.txt it fails and the text on /MAAS never goes away
[21:25] <alperkanat> any ideas?
[21:26] <alperkanat> this fails: https://maas.ubuntu.com/images/
