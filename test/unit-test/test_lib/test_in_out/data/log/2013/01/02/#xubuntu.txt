[00:05] <xubuntu655> greeting!  trying to determine which version to download for a netbook.... any help would be appreciated  asus 1015px
[00:07] <Noskcaj> xubuntu655, xubuntu 12.10 amd64 is my recommendation, you could use netboot to install it if it has not much ram
[00:12] <Noskcaj> xubuntu655, it will work fine, just google what to do to help the ssd in ubuntu
[00:12] <xubuntu655> excellent!  thanks for the support.. off to install new SSD and boot 12.10 from SD or USB and see how it goes....
[01:07] <guest-8kYw9S> I entered a command in terminal, startx-- -nolisten tcp and now when I try to login, I see a black screen saying something about the X window system and then get logged out
[01:07] <guest-8kYw9S> I never actually login, I just see the screen, then get back to the login screen. how can I fix this?
[01:09] <CrazyZurfer> I've got a problem, when the screensaver starts when I'm in full screen mode (for example watching a movie), then when I move the mouse, the computer freezes with the whole screen in grey
[01:09] <CrazyZurfer> every time it happens I've to restart the pc
[04:21] <donnie> Does anyone here know how to step by step set up the google android sdk? All I need are the google android drivers
[04:24] <holstein> donnie: i would eleborate on "all i need" but i would just follow a guide
[04:25] <donnie> Holstein. Tried the guides. The only thing I need from the sdk is the google drivers for usb. I do not need to write or code android programs
[04:25] <holstein> donnie: i just plug my phone in, and it works
[04:26] <donnie> holstein. Mines not that nice to play.. I have the ZTE Avail.. It doesn't come with usb support
[04:30] <holstein> donnie: what are you trying to do? it should show as a USB devic
[04:30] <holstein> e
[04:31] <donnie> holstein. It should do a lot of things but this phone does not. I have it connected right now. I have usb debugging turned on. Nothing shows up
[04:32] <holstein> donnie: it should show up as a hard drive or something.. look in the options
[04:33] <donnie> holstein. It does not show up as anything. It does nothing. Therefore I think I need to install the google android usb drivers
[04:33] <holstein> donnie: you shouldnt have to.. what about in lsusb ?
[04:33] <donnie> holstein. No idea. How would I check
[04:34] <holstein> donnie: i would open a terminal and type 'lsusb'.... feel free to pastebin that
[04:34] <donnie> I just found out howto root it. with the keypad...
[04:36] <holstein> donnie: i would try the android support channels for info on rooting your phone
[04:36] <donnie> holstein. I just rooted it I found out how. Now I have to find out if I can install aps from download to sd card since I'm between carriers
[04:38] <holstein> donnie: i would just pop into a proper support channel.. otherwise we could talk about it in the OT channel
[04:38] <donnie> holstein. I'm gonna. Thank you though for trying to help

[10:14] <leexu> anyone awake?
[10:15] <leexu> okay guess i will see if installation is far enough along so i can download chromium
[10:17] <koegs> leexu: what is your question?
[10:19] <leexu> huh question well i am installing xubuntu 12.10 i think and am trying to download the latest flashplayer which I assume is in chromium?
[10:23] <koegs> leexu: if you want to have built-in flash, you have to use "google chrome", not "chromium-browser"
[10:23] <leexu> ah thank you good to know
[10:24] <koegs> or you just install "flashplugin-installer"
[10:24] <leexu> i don't think i am up to installs yet
[10:25] <leexu> i have installed chrome before 'by the menu' but that's about it
[10:27] <leexu> i'm sort of a old hater of microsoft ;-)
[10:27] <TheSheep> chrome has flash built in, chromium doesn't
[10:28] <koegs> that's what i said :)
[10:28] <leexu> excellent information i will install as soon as xubuntu installs

[15:40] <antithesis> Hello
[15:40] <antithesis> Can anyone name examples of how Xubuntu is more user-friendly than Debian with Xfce?
[15:42] <bazhang> antithesis, what do you mean.
[15:44] <antithesis> Well, what are the differences between the two in general?
[15:44] <antithesis> Isn't a major feature of Ubuntu that it's out-of-the-box?
[15:45] <bazhang> not really
[15:45] <TheSheep> antithesis: the only difference is in what applications are installed by default and what desktop environment is used
[15:45] <bazhang> debian and ubuntu both have ways of adding propietary codecs to play mp3, movies, etc
[15:46] <TheSheep> antithesis: xubuntu uses xfce4, which seem to be well liked by people who are accustomed to "traditional" interfaces
[15:46] <antithesis> Are there no differences in supported hardware, for example?
[15:46] <TheSheep> antithesis: no, under the hood they are exactly the same
[15:47] <TheSheep> antithesis: it's the same base system with a different set of default apps
[15:48] <antithesis> So if Ubuntu can run Steam, so can Debian?
[15:48] <Pici> Between (X)Ubuntu and Debian there are different kernel patches though.
[15:48] <bazhang> ask in #debian about running steam
[15:49] <antithesis> It was just an example
[15:50] <antithesis> If they're really the same under the hood, what do these mean?: http://i.imgur.com/zXARw.png
[15:52] <Pici> What is that?
[15:53] <antithesis> A dialog you see when you try to download Ubuntu
[15:53] <antithesis> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/questions?distro=desktop&bits=32&release=latest
[15:54] <Pici> Like I said, we may provide kernel patches that Debian does not.. or work to write kernel patches.
[15:54] <Pici> I think TheSheep was speaking about the difference between Ubuntu and Xubuntu
[15:55] <antithesis> Well, could you give an example of those kernel patches? What does the end user notice?
[15:55] <TheSheep> Pici: ah, right, I missed the beginning and just assumed it was that
[15:55] <TheSheep> antithesis: sorry
[15:55] <antithesis> Does it make a big difference
[15:55] <antithesis> TheSheep np
[15:56] <TheSheep> still, all the patches that Ubuntu has are free for taking, just Debian doesn't incorporate some of them because of ideological reasons
[15:56] <antithesis> Because of reasons?
[15:57] <TheSheep> antithesis: Debian has a very strict set of rules about what gets included
[15:57] <antithesis> Lol I'm kidding
[15:57] <antithesis> What I meant was that that's a pleonasm
[15:57] <TheSheep> antithesis: for example, they didn't want Firefox because its logo is a registered trademark
[15:58] <TheSheep> antithesis: you have to excuse me, English is not my native language and I don't know how to better say that the resons are ideological
[15:58] <TheSheep> reasons*
[15:59] <antithesis> ofc
[15:59] <antithesis> But nobody has an example of a patch Ubuntu has that Debian doesn't?
[17:24] <KeyboardNotFound> hello all, who is best software for unzip .zip files ?

[22:58] <Guest77791> On my xubuntu 12.10 desktop, I want to: 1. use smaller desktop ions, 2. change the menu structure. Can anyone show me where this is explained?
[23:02] <holstein> Guest77791:
[23:02] <holstein> http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfdesktop/preferences
[23:03] <holstein> Guest77791: http://xubuntugeek.blogspot.com/2012/06/how-to-graphically-edit-xfcexubuntu.html
[23:07] <Guest77791> :) Thanks, holstein. Also, I have installed a Ruby Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and the Bluefish HTML editor. The latter appears in the 'Development' sub-menu, which was created when I installed Bluefish, but the former is not to be found there or anywhere else? Does anyone know why this might be?
[23:08] <holstein> Guest77791: i didnt think that was a GUI
[23:08] <holstein> Guest77791: i think that is command line
[23:09] <holstein> Guest77791: i could be wrong.. you'd need to elaborate as wo what ruby ide you speak of and where you got it
[23:11] <Guest77791> My "Ubuntu Software Centre" graphical interface, used instead of apt-get, ... on this occasion, calls it "Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby (default version)". I can't find a shorter name.
[23:12] <holstein> Guest77791: its not a GUI afaik
[23:14] <Guest77791> The rfuby ide is not a GUI so therefore does not appear on any menu?  So I need to open a terminal?
[23:14] <holstein> Guest77791: if you want to use the tooll you downloaded that doesnt have a GUI nor a menu entry, thats where i would start
[23:15] <holstein> you might want something like http://arcadia.rubyforge.org/ which im sure there is something in the repos...
[23:20] <Guest77791> :) I was at a dead-end only half an hour ago and now have a large number of promising paths to choose from. Thank you, again, holstein. (A good touch typing tutor may help here I have Klavaro).
[23:22] <holstein> Guest77791: enjoy!
[23:23] <Guest77791> I'll let u know how it goes.
[23:43] <Guest77791> The tabbed icon form at main_menu->settings_manager->desktop allowed me to reduce the desktop icon size from 32px to 24px. (I could have reduced it to 8px. Now I have to find how to also reduce the text font size -- right now not as easy to find as I had expected.)
[23:47] <Guest77791> There's a "Use custom size" field, only active if the check-box in front of  it is checked. I reduced the font to 6px :)
[23:51] <Guest77791> On another topic, can anyone show me how to 1. create a desktop background with a paint program like gimp? Install it?  What I want is a desktop that has multiple faint images of a QWERTY keyboard.
[23:53] <Guest77791> ... I meant: show me where to find the information. I can start search in through the gimp online manual myself, unless anyone can point directly to what I want.
