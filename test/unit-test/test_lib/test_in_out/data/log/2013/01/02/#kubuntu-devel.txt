[10:49] <shadeslayer> huh?
[10:49] <shadeslayer> no answer from where?
[10:50] <shadeslayer> Tm_T: ??
[10:50] <Tm_T> shadeslayer: steam (:
[10:50] <shadeslayer> ohhh
[10:50] <shadeslayer> I forgot
[10:50] <shadeslayer> :P
[10:51] <shadeslayer> Tm_T: accepted :D
[10:51] <Tm_T> thank you son
[10:52] <Tm_T> see, this is me doing paperwork (;
[10:52] <shadeslayer> lol

=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[12:42] <yofel> ScottK: what's your progress on kdelibs? As 4.9.5 seems to be out I'll publish it later when I have time, but we'll have to add the kdelibs symbol changes later then
[13:30] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[13:48] <ScottK> shadeslayer: It wasn't empty when I made it.
[13:48] <ScottK> So no.
[13:49] <shadeslayer> I see
[13:50] <shadeslayer> needs fixing then
[13:52] <shadeslayer> ScottK: one other thing, synaptiks kcm craps out on raring
[13:52] <shadeslayer> however
[13:52] <shadeslayer> if you run synaptiks via konsole
[13:53] <shadeslayer> and click Touchpad Configuration, it works fine
[13:54] <ScottK> What error?
[13:55] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/635588/
[13:55] <shadeslayer> backtrace : http://paste.kde.org/635594/
[13:56] <shadeslayer> not particularly helpful I guess
[13:56] <shadeslayer> lemme grab the dbg symbols and I'll get back to you
[13:56] <ScottK> OK.
[13:57] <ScottK> shadeslayer: Ask JontheEchidna.  He's most likely to know I think.
[13:57] <shadeslayer> okie
[13:57] <shadeslayer> JontheEchidna: ^ synaptiks broken, fix it fix it fix it
[13:57] <ScottK> yofel: Test building something now.
[14:34] <shadeslayer> hah
[14:34] <shadeslayer> SteveRiley: ScottK https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/make-metric-system-standard-united-states-instead-imperial-system/FndsKXLh
[14:38] <yofel> can I sign that whithout being an US citizen? ^^
[14:39] <shadeslayer> lol
[14:40] <shadeslayer> Try creating an account? :P
[14:45] <ScottK> Why?
[14:45] <ScottK> yofel: What a nice symbols update you just uploaded ....
[15:25] <yofel> ScottK: huh? I didn't upload anything
[15:25] <ScottK> yofel: I updated and reuploaded it.
[15:26] <yofel> oh, thank you very much ;)
[15:26] <yofel> I'll update the 4.9.5 package so we can publish that later
[15:28] <shadeslayer> JontheEchidna: http://paste.kde.org/~shadeslayer/635672/
[15:30] <shadeslayer> ScottK: ^ Full backtrace if you're interested
[15:31] <ScottK> shadeslayer: I think that's an "ask barry" problem.
[15:31] <shadeslayer> heh okay
[15:32] <yofel> synaptiks does support py3 does it?
[15:32] <shadeslayer> I think I want to poke this a bit before asking him, need to understand what's causing this in the first place
[15:32] <shadeslayer> yofel: I don't think so
[15:32] <yofel> shadeslayer: well, your former backtrace was using python 3.3 libs, so that's probably the issue
[15:32] <yofel> as kpythonpluginfactory in raring is linked against py33
[15:33] <yofel> if you just run it by hand you'll probably use py2
[15:33] <shadeslayer> former? the backtrace is the same I think
[15:34] <yofel> http://paste.kde.org/635594/ shows /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.3m.so.1.0
[15:34] <yofel> your updated trace only shows the source files, not the lib names
[15:35] <shadeslayer> hmm
[15:36] <shadeslayer> this is what I get when I go through systemsettings > input devices > touchpad : http://paste.kde.org/~shadeslayer/635690/
[15:37] <yofel> same stacktracetop from what I see
[15:37] <shadeslayer> yeah
[15:37] <shadeslayer> yofel: funny thing is, when you run synaptiks ( the binary ) and choose touchpad settings, it works
[15:38] <shadeslayer> probably because it forces python2?
[15:38] <yofel> iirc 'python' is still python2 in raring
[15:38] <yofel> can't check right now
[15:38] <yofel> try running 'python3 synaptiks'
[15:38] <yofel> er, with full path
[15:39] <shadeslayer> pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: synaptiks==0.8.1
[15:39] <yofel> hum
[15:39] <shadeslayer> I wonder if there's a way to force python2 in the KCM
[15:44] <yofel> no idea. IIRC userconfig has the same problem
[15:46] <shadeslayer> yofel: yeah, looks like a python3 issue
[15:46] <shadeslayer> almost similar stack trace
[15:47] <yofel> with synaptiks AFAIK being unmaintained though this is a larger problem though, maybe we could talk to the dev about having a py3 branch on github
[15:47] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/~shadeslayer/635708/
[15:47] <shadeslayer> yofel: from what I read on the github issue tracker, he was looking for new maintainers a year ago
[15:47] <yofel> yeah, it's RFA, but I haven't seen any progress there...
[15:49] <yofel> As a start we would have to first build the module for python3 though, that shouldn't be too much work
[15:49] <yofel> you obviously can't run what doesn't exist

=== Quintasan_ is now known as Quintasan
[16:01] <Quintasan> This was the best New Years Party ever
[16:01] <Quintasan> Time to get to work then
[16:02] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: maliit is still on hold for the soname magic but mikhas said it should be doable (getting rid of them)
[16:02] <shadeslayer> oic
[16:02] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: PA3 is on hold till I get a hold of an ExoPC
[16:02] <shadeslayer> probably this weekend I guess
[16:03] <mikhas> yep
[16:03] <Quintasan> What do you need it for exactly?
[16:03] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: If you want testers then we have ScottK with his Nexus and hopefully SteveRiley
[16:03] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: there are some multi touch patches in kde-workspace that need testing
[16:03] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: no arm builds
[16:03] <shadeslayer> only i386
[16:03] <Quintasan> Are there many resulting binary packages?
[16:04] <Quintasan> We could just build it in ScottK's build farm
[16:04] <Quintasan> and copypaste stuff
[16:04] <shadeslayer> I didn't count
[16:04] <mikhas> Quintasan, it must have been a good party if you slept until now =p
[16:04] <Quintasan> mikhas: I've been wide awake till 8 in the morning
[16:04] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-active/+archive/ppa/+packages?field.name_filter=&field.status_filter=published&field.series_filter=raring
[16:04] <Quintasan> then I decided to go to bed
[16:04] <Quintasan> :D
[16:05] <Quintasan> uh crap
[16:05] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: looks like a ton of work
[16:05] <shadeslayer> yeah
[16:05] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: Where are the packaging branches so I can fetch them?
[16:05] <mikhas> so +30 hours of partying â€¦ sounds wild
[16:05] <shadeslayer> there are none
[16:05] <shadeslayer> I haven't pushed the packaging anywhere
[16:06] <Quintasan> mikhas: We decied that we ought to start cleaning up the mess
[16:06] <shadeslayer> Right now it's just a bunch of hastily put together packages as of right now
[16:06] <Quintasan> ...
[16:06] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: push the packaging branches somewhere so I can work on them
[16:07] <Quintasan> preferably ~kubuntu-dev
[16:07] <Quintasan> since it will be part of Kubuntu sooner or later
[16:07] <shadeslayer> will do tomorrow
[16:07] <Quintasan> mikhas: Currently my work order is something like this
[16:07] <shadeslayer> I just want to get into the warm comfort of my bed right now
[16:08] <Quintasan> malitt-framework -> maliit-plugins -> pa3 (it is on hold for maliiit) -> active images
[16:08] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: Sure, going to bed altogether or just a nap?
[16:08] <shadeslayer> the formere
[16:08] <shadeslayer> -e
[16:08] <Quintasan> night then
[16:08] <shadeslayer> nighters :)
[16:09] <Quintasan> ScottK: Think you could copypaste resulting debs to your nexus 7 if I do the building?
[16:15] <yofel> Quintasan: if you can get an ssh key of those machines I can give you a repos where you can upload the binaries to
[16:18] <mikhas> right, shadeslayer's comment @ lwn mentioned you were blocking on Maliit
[16:18] <Quintasan> yofel: I wish I could connect first :P
[16:18] <yofel> well, I'll keep the offer open
[16:18] <Quintasan> mikhas: It's not a dependency block but imagine using that on a tablet without a on-screen keyboard :D
[16:22] <mikhas> that's why Bluetooth keyboards were invented ;-)
[16:23] <mikhas> Built-in support for BT keyboards came very early in Maliit, though it no longer exists. Imagine why ;-)
[16:25] <Quintasan> mikhas: Not everyone has one and not everyone carries one around :P
[16:25] <Quintasan> Showers are the best thing invented since sliced bread
[16:26]  * Quintasan goes to wash dishes
[16:29] <shadeslayer> mikhas: not just maliit actually, other factors like man power etc as well iirc 
[16:29] <shadeslayer> oh
[16:30] <yofel> grrrr
[16:30] <shadeslayer> ScottK: could you rebuild ktp-text-ui ? new tp-logger causes issues 
[16:30] <yofel> ScottK: is there an easy way to build a python package for both 2.7 and 3.3 or do I really need to run setup.py by hand for every version that I want?
[16:31] <shadeslayer> or for that matter, anyone with upload rights 
[16:32] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: I can
[16:32] <shadeslayer> cool 
[16:32]  * Quintasan thinks he remembers how to do it
[16:33] <shadeslayer> its just that ktp-text-ui tries to find the old lib, when the so name was bumped
[18:22] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: uploaded
[18:24] <shadeslayer> tnx
[18:25] <shadeslayer> thx
[18:53] <shadeslayer> lololol
[18:54] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: tp logger qt also needs rebuilding 
[18:59] <Quintasan> FFFF
[19:00] <shadeslayer> check all reverse build deps and rebuild 
[19:11] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: maybe hold off on rebuilding? theres a new package that might get syncd
[19:11] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: libtelepathy-logger-qt4-1 rebuild?
[19:12] <Quintasan> libktpchat0 kde-telepathy-text-ui are rdepends
[19:12] <Quintasan> of kde-telepathy-text-ui
[19:12] <shadeslayer> http://ftp-master.debian.org/new/telepathy-logger_0.6.0-2.html
[19:12] <Quintasan> 0.4.0 in Ubuntu
[19:12] <shadeslayer> no, shouldn't reverse build deps for tp logger be enough?
[19:13] <Quintasan> but it is in main and I don't think I can do anything about that
[19:13] <Quintasan> apt-cache rdepends libtelepathy-logger-qt4-1 
[19:13] <shadeslayer> errr .. raring has 0.6.0-1
[19:13] <Quintasan> kde-telepathy-text-ui
[19:13] <Quintasan> libktpchat0
[19:13] <shadeslayer> use reverse-depends -b
[19:14] <shadeslayer> apt doesn't show stuff at times 
[19:14] <shadeslayer> and only check for tp logger, not tp logger qt
[19:14] <Quintasan> well you said qt needs rebuilding
[19:14] <Quintasan> :P
[19:15] <Quintasan> [~]% reverse-depends -b telepathy-logger                                                                                                                                                     (quintasan@demonbane:~)
[19:15] <Quintasan> No reverse dependencies found
[19:15] <Quintasan> even better
[19:15] <shadeslayer> yes, but do we also need to rebuild everything that deps on tp logger qt?
[19:16] <shadeslayer> wrong package name ?
[19:16] <Quintasan> Dunno, but I guess that would be the safe approach
[19:16] <shadeslayer> libtelepathy-logger-dev 
[19:16] <Quintasan> libtelepathy-logger2
[19:16] <Quintasan> no rdeps as well
[19:17] <shadeslayer> dude ...
[19:17] <shadeslayer> check against the dev package 
[19:17] <Quintasan> lal
[19:17] <Quintasan> it doesnt do that?
[19:18] <Quintasan> * cinnamon
[19:18] <Quintasan> * empathy
[19:18] <Quintasan> * gnome-shell
[19:18] <Quintasan> * telepathy-logger-qt
[19:18] <Quintasan> sounds like fun
[19:18] <shadeslayer> and council hasn't taken a vote on the card afaik 
[19:18] <shadeslayer> fun 
[19:18] <Quintasan> I don't think I can touch the first 3
[19:19] <shadeslayer> question is, do we wait for the package to get kicked from debian new? 
[19:19] <shadeslayer> because so version Changed 
[19:19] <Quintasan> If we do then I won't have to do anything (probaby)
[19:19] <shadeslayer> hence package name Changed, etc etc
[19:20] <Quintasan> I'd wait and see what happens
[19:20] <shadeslayer> idk, ktp text ui is unusable at the moment
[19:20] <Quintasan> It can't break EVERYTHING and if something happens it should be rather easy to fix
[19:20] <shadeslayer> weird situation 
[19:21] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: if you want to rebuild we would have to go around and ask maintainers of empaty and gnome-shell to make a rebuild right now
[19:21] <Quintasan> rebuild now*
[19:21] <shadeslayer> ScottK: please advise ^
[19:21] <Quintasan> those two are in main and they are not part of our seed so I can't touch then afaik
[19:21] <Quintasan> dunno where the hell cinnamon is
[19:22] <Quintasan> !package cinnamon raring
[19:22] <ubottu> Quintasan: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[19:22] <Quintasan> kubotu: !package cinnamon raring
[19:22] <yofel> !info cinnamon
[19:22] <ubottu> Package cinnamon does not exist in quantal
[19:22]  * Quintasan never knows how to use the damn bot
[19:22] <shadeslayer> desktop env like kde
[19:22] <yofel> !info cinnamon raring
[19:22] <ubottu> cinnamon (source: cinnamon): Innovative and comfortable desktop. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.6.7-1 (raring), package size 471 kB, installed size 1872 kB
[19:23] <Quintasan> This I can touch after all
[19:23] <Quintasan> since it's universe
[19:23] <yofel> razorqt made it into raring too, haven't tried it yet
[19:23] <shadeslayer> nice 
[19:24] <ScottK> Quintasan: I'd have to install Ubuntu on it first.  It's still stock Android.
[19:24] <ScottK> But I can do that.
[19:25] <ScottK> yofel: For now you need to call setup.py in a loop. 
[19:25] <Quintasan> ScottK: Oh, okay. Let me know if that happens.
[19:25] <yofel> ok
[19:26] <ScottK> The Kubuntu arm boxen are armhf now, so the binaries can be built there in a raring chroot.
[19:26] <ScottK> shadeslayer: Ubuntu doesn't have package maintainers.  JFDI.
[19:27] <shadeslayer> ScottK: sure, but there's a package in debian new, when that gets syncd we get to rebuild again
[19:28] <shadeslayer> so the question is , 2 rebuilds or 1 ?
[19:28] <ScottK> Builders aren't very busy, so I'd say fixing sooner rather than later is better (i.e. 2)
[19:29] <shadeslayer> very well :)
[19:30] <Quintasan> ScottK: Any idea why I can't connect to arm box?
[19:30]  * ScottK checks
[19:30] <yofel> ScottK: I'll take another look at kdelibs 4.9.4 once the arm builds are done. Symbolfiles still aren't quite right
[19:31] <yofel> how does one even get to those arm boxes? I never tried
[19:31] <ScottK> Quintasan: I can connect here.
[19:31] <Quintasan> port 98?
[19:31] <ScottK> 100
[19:31] <ScottK> 98 was temporary
[19:38] <ScottK> yofel: I think you'll have to hand edit the symbols files, but at least from looking at amd64, it didn't seem too bad.
[20:36] <Noskcaj> ScottK, ping
[20:50] <ScottK> Noskcaj: pong
[20:50] <Noskcaj> could you update the kubuntu oem testcase? we might be splitting it from ubuntu oem due to some differences. come over to -quality
[20:50] <ScottK> I have the powers.
[20:50] <ScottK> If you tell me what to put in it, I'll be glad to.
[22:44] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: Where do I report kio-mtp bugs?
[22:46] <Quintasan> My friend can't connect his phone  LG-E610 using kio-mtp. It just opens the notification with "mtp:udi=/org/kde/solid/udev/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.2/" as conent and nothing happens
[22:47] <Quintasan> content*
[23:33] <yofel> ScottK: next try up, I confirmed that it's correct on i386 and amd64 at least. The other archs should be fine I think.
[23:34] <ScottK> yofel: Can you build it on the armhf box?
[23:34] <yofel> how do I get there?
[23:54] <yofel> ScottK: ?
[23:56] <Riddell> yofel: ssh -p 100 arm.kitterman.com
[23:57] <ScottK> Riddell: I'm setting up his account now.
[23:59] <Riddell> ah hah
