[10:54] <MartijnV1S> Azelphur: looks a lot like it
=== Lcawte is now known as Lcawte|Away
[10:56] <Azelphur> lol fairly conclusive, started up a live usb and it doesn't even show up in gparted
[10:56] <Azelphur> it broke.

[12:57] <daftykins> Azelphur: breaking hardware now D:
[12:57] <daftykins> well, more
[12:57] <Azelphur> daftykins: fixing, turns out it was a busted cable
[12:57] <Azelphur> :D
[12:57] <daftykins> ah neat-o
[12:58] <daftykins> what's worse is when you know a drive is funky, but you can't get the manufacturer diagnostics tools to admit it
[12:59] <Azelphur> hehe
[13:00] <daftykins> i've got an OSX mountain lion VM now :O
[13:06] <brobostigon> whats the freenode ban command ?
[13:06] <daftykins>  /q ?
[13:06] <daftykins> oh no that's mode
[13:06] <daftykins> never done any admin'ing on freenode ;x
[13:07] <brobostigon> ok.
[13:08] <brobostigon> i did as it suggested on http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml i e, set +b mode, and it didnt work.
[13:08] <daftykins> are you opered up?
[13:09] <brobostigon> yes.
[13:11] <daftykins> hrmm unless the ban mask isn't applying
[13:11] <daftykins> if it isn't just a nick
[13:41] <bootkigftrgds> Heads up .. this is one for @czajkowski [ http://goo.gl/k8Zlm ] .. ends in 40 minutes ::: LAAANDON [Free Postage - the fools !!]  ::: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/300845859363?ssPageName=STRK:MEBIDX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1431.l2649&autorefresh=true
[13:47] <dwatkins> in the description it says 'pick up only'
[13:48] <dwatkins> "only two corners thst make up the first picture are remaining"
[13:49] <bootkigftrgds> dwatkins: That is a dirisory comment, by you dwatkins :: Anyone can 'pick up' a Sofa .. It's who pays for the collectin .. And this is 50% of the battle as Ebay would infer it would be at the cost of the ebay Marketeer ..
[13:49] <dwatkins> maybe
[13:50] <bootkigftrgds> It's legit, I sear..
[13:50] <dwatkins> you'd need to arrange a courier
[13:50] <bootkigftrgds> Done !
[13:50] <dwatkins> the description does say it quite clearly, but I see your point, it'll be interesting to see what happens
[13:51] <bootkigftrgds> El bill i being printed by www.NORspeed.com as we speak ..
[13:51] <bootkigftrgds> **....is being...
[13:52] <bootkigftrgds> Also on ebay.eu ... http://goo.gl/0MfL4

[15:55] <brobostigon> it is preferable isnt it, to setup your wifi channel, to one, that is as far away as possible, from any around it? yes.
[16:51] <shauno> brobostigon: big time, yeah.  wifi channels overlap a lot, so you don't just want to be on a different channel, but preferable 4-5 channels away from your closest neighbours
[16:51] <ali1234> and it's better to be on the same channel than off by one
[16:52] <brobostigon> shauno: everything is used, except for some space between channel 8 and 9 and 3 and 4.
[16:54] <shauno> that's pretty normal.  the trick is to figure out who's using them.  I Worry more about coliding with my neighbour upstairs, than the offices across the road.  I can drown out weak neighbours
[16:55] <brobostigon> ours is set to channel 6 and is atleast between 2 to three time as powerful as anything around here.
[16:56] <brobostigon> times*
[16:56] <shauno> the other fun one is to make sure your wifi is set to UK, because a lot are set to US out of the box, so won't have channels 12 & 13
[16:56] <brobostigon> it has 12 and 13.
[17:04] <ali1234> a lot of hardware won't allow you to use 12 and 13 under linux
[17:06] <shauno> didn't know that.  but then I don't use linux on mobile devices
[17:07] <ali1234> not mobile devices.
[17:07] <ali1234> laptops
[17:07] <brobostigon> interesting,
[17:07] <ali1234> it can also be caused by the AP
[17:08] <ali1234> because CRDA will only allow the set of channels allowed by every device involved
[17:08] <ali1234> the AP broadcasts it's idea of what country it is in in the beacons
[17:08] <ali1234> if it broadcasts "hello i'm in china" on channel 13, linux will attempt to connect and then fail over and over
[17:09] <ali1234> and it won't give an error message
[17:09] <ali1234> it will put some message on dmesg like "disconnecting by choice"
[17:09] <brobostigon> so as shauno said, inportent to set the country properly.?
[17:09] <ali1234> setting the country doesn't make any different
[17:10] <brobostigon> interesting, hmmm,
[17:10] <ali1234> you can't et the country in your wifi card firmware without special software
[17:10] <ali1234> and you can't set the country code at all on a lot of routers
[17:10] <ali1234> you can, but it doesn't actually affect what the beacon says due to badly designed firmwares
[17:10] <brobostigon> ah.
[17:11] <ali1234> so the router will hapily use channel 13, but your linux machine will refuse to connect to it
[17:11] <ali1234> windows doesn't do nearly as much checks so they work fine
[17:11] <brobostigon> hmmm,
[17:12] <ali1234> basically attempting to use 12 or 13 is a waste of time because it wont work properly on too many devices
[17:12] <ali1234> unless you are lucky and didn't buy any broken hardware
[17:27] <SuperMatt> nice to see the new ubuntu icon has dropped into raring
[17:43] <SuperMatt> anyone else noticed that the raring has been more stable during development than any other of previous releases?
[17:44] <penguin42> SuperMatt: It's been pretty good for me - I know a few people who are having problems getting it to boot
[17:45] <SuperMatt> really? Good job I haven't considered upgrading my work pc
[18:30] <kvarley> Any plans yet to integrate Nautilus with Mega?
[18:32] <penguin42> SuperMatt: I think it's specific hardware, but I know 2 people with very different hardware
[19:17] <andrews> Hey all - does anyone else have problems using Ubuntu and Channel 4's On Demand service?
[19:24] <Darael> andrews: freezing after the last of the ads?
[19:24] <Darael> I was just getting ready to report that it seemed to be working fine from here, too.
[19:25] <bootkigftrgds> dwatkins: Thanks- heaben's Sheffield got it right ... http://goo.gl/JZYPo aall for today, beddie-byes All
[19:27] <andrews> Darael - yes.  Thats indeed the problem!
[19:28] <andrews> Only certain shows though
[19:29] <andrews> Some work, some just go black screen and freeze after the adverts
[19:29] <Darael> Well, no idea what's causing it, but at least it's definitely not just thee.
[19:30] <andrews> Was trying to watch that World Without End and it just freezes after the nokia ads.  Is it some DRM lockout?
[20:05] <popey> Evening!

[20:18] <penguin42> popey: Couldn't you bring some warm weather back with you?
[20:22] <ali1234> hmm... maplin sells on amazon...
[20:22] <ali1234> http://www.amazon.co.uk/V80H-70MAH-MOUNTED-BATTERY-RECHARGEABLE/dp/B005ZS3XAQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1358626896&sr=1-3
[20:25] <ali1234> prices are identical, including delivery... so they are making a loss on that over the website
[20:25] <ali1234> but presumably they get enough extra business to make up for that
[21:44] <Azelphur> popey: broke ubuntu.com, https://help.ubuntu.com/11.04/ubuntu-help/session-fingerprint.html

[22:57] <Azelphur> Trying to get Steam running on Ubuntu 12.10, problem is when I install fglrx-updates, or install the latest version of fglrx from the website, Unity doesn't start at all (above bug), any ideas? :(
[23:03] <dwatkins> sadly my ATI/AMD card just died
[23:05] <Azelphur> indeed, this is very frustrating :(
[23:06] <Azelphur> tempting to downgrade to 12.04 to work around it
[23:22] <penguin42> or upgrade to Raring
[23:26] <ali1234> Azelphur: or remove unity
