[16:49] <Kilos> maybe i look at it next month when next 8ta 2+1 goes in
[16:49] <kbmonkey> by using light guis, the updates also weigh less. it adds up for updates :)

[19:12] <Kilos> this ups has been runnig all day on xp pc without a prob
[19:14] <inetpro> Kilos: ai!
[19:15] <Kilos> ya ai!
[19:15] <inetpro> Kilos: you modified it again?
[19:15] <Kilos> i dont understand why it gives probs here
[19:15] <Kilos> just disconnected internal battery
[19:15] <Kilos> but still rebooted here so i moved it
[19:16] <Kilos> now i got the software win win and linux but need to figure how to tell the thing what to do
[19:17] <Kilos> i think via network cable
[19:18] <Kilos> the software asks for ip addresses even
[19:19] <Kilos> maybe the ups's programming is corrupted some
[19:19] <Kilos> wb smile
[19:19] <kbmonkey> what do you want to tell the ups, Kilos 
[19:19] <kbmonkey> power-manager settings?
[19:20] <Kilos> when i have it on this pc it keeps rebooting
[19:20] <smile> thanks :p
[19:20] <smile> lol, i quit seamonkey xD
[19:20] <kbmonkey> it kills the power to the pc?
[19:20] <Kilos> but worked for months without a prob
[19:20] <kbmonkey> does not sound good :(
[19:20] <kbmonkey> ups's work unconfigured
[19:20] <Kilos> used to switch off 2 mins after power cut
[19:21] <Kilos> if its faulty it should be faulty on both pcs
[19:21] <kbmonkey> and now?
[19:21] <kbmonkey> maybe it's your pc?
[19:21] <Kilos> its been running fine on xp all day
[19:21] <Kilos> yeah but only when ups is plugged in?
[19:22] <kbmonkey> a ghost in the ups
[19:22] <Kilos> lol
[19:22] <kbmonkey> voodoo magik
[19:22] <Kilos> dont start
[19:23] <Kilos> i think i gotta check voltages all over and see where something isnt happy
[19:23] <Kilos> cant be from overheating because it rebooted within 2 mins of startup
[19:24] <Kilos> i didnt try all the output sockets either
