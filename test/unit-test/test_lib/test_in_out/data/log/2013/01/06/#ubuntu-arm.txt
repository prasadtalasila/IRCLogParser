[21:05] <k3yboardninja> So is there any work around whatsoever to get youtube flash videos playing? Or is there really no hope in this case unlike android where hacks have been a possibility
[21:19] <k3yboardninja> Does anyone have any sort of workaround for getting flash to work? Or is it a lost cause?
[21:21] <infinity> k3yboardninja: That would require having a flash binary.
[21:22] <k3yboardninja> figured
[21:22] <k3yboardninja> its unfortunate that youtube can't show video ads with the html5 player...it makes it a largely useless feature
[21:53] <anders2_> vanhoof, hi, do you have a minut?
[21:55] <anders2_> My Nexus 7 is stuck in a initramfs shell after installing Ubuntu. I cant get into fastboot. Anyone?
[21:57] <tassadar_> hold power button for 10+ seconds until it the screen goes dark, then press volume down and hold it until you get to bootloader
[21:57] <anders2_> tassadar_, thanks a million
[21:58] <anders2_> tassadar_, worked like a charm
