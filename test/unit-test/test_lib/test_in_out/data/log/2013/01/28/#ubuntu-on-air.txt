[19:23] <Josh____> Hi, i was wondering if it is possible to multi boot Ubuntu and Mandriva on the same hard drive although they have separate boot grubs.
[19:23] <JoseeAntonioR> Josh____: You can get support in #ubuntu, just type '/j #ubuntu' without quotes
[19:25] <Josh____> so it is possible, i just installed ubuntu and mandriva and when i rebooted it showed that mandriva overwrite ubuntu's grub
[19:26] <JoseeAntonioR> Josh____: I'm telling you, this is not the right place to ask for support
