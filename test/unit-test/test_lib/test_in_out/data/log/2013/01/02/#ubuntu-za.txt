[07:43] <Kilos> im just worried it hurt you too magespawn 
[07:43] <Kilos> i did a sudo apt-get update and it said its gonna report me
[07:43] <Kilos> hehe

[08:15] <Kilos> yip. even changed graphics cards
[08:16] <Kilos> tough being doff. ians graphics card is a pci one and i couldnt figure why i could see gui from live cd but not even see bios

[09:02] <inetpro> All-New Ubuntu Product to Launch Jan 2nd – But What Is It? http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/12/all-new-ubuntu-product-to-launch-jan-2nd-but-what-is-it
[09:02]  * inetpro wonders what that is all about
[09:03] <Kilos> what i missed
[09:03] <inetpro> Kilos: All-New Ubuntu Product to Launch Jan 2nd – But What Is It? http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/12/all-new-ubuntu-product-to-launch-jan-2nd-but-what-is-it
[09:03] <Kilos> lo inetpro 
[09:04] <inetpro> to be announced at around 5 - 6PM GMT
[09:05] <Kilos> ah me wonders too
[09:06] <inetpro> Maaz: when is 17:00 gmt in Pretoria
[09:06] <Maaz> inetpro: 2013-01-02 17:00:00 GMT is 2013-01-02 19:00:00 SAST
[09:09] <Kilos> yo drussell 
[09:10] <Kilos> you need to set your pc to away when you are away
[09:10] <Kilos> and you inetpro 
[09:11] <inetpro> Kilos: why?
[09:11] <Kilos> so i dont think you just lurking dodo
[09:11]  * inetpro never sleeps
[09:11] <Kilos> hahaha
[09:11] <magespawn> just afk sometimes
[09:11] <Kilos> but sometimes take half a day to answer
[09:12] <Kilos> then show an afk somehow
[09:12] <Kilos> because
[09:13] <Kilos> you are often too tired to scroll back
[09:13] <Kilos> old age is tough
[09:15] <inetpro> Kilos: you can't possibly expect everyone to answer immediately every time you say something
[09:16] <Kilos> no man
[09:16] <Kilos> but if i ask now. in three hours ive forgotten what i asked
[09:17] <Kilos> you no theres no short term memory installed
[09:17] <Kilos> or buggy ram
[09:17] <inetpro> that short term memory of yours is not that buggy any more at all
[09:18] <Kilos> jaja
[09:18] <Kilos> ty for my happy , safe bot
[09:18] <inetpro> sometimes even better than mine
[09:18] <inetpro> Kilos: np
[09:19] <Kilos> lol thats only old age on your part
[09:19] <Kilos> hehe
[09:20] <Kilos> hey Banlam howzit
[10:07] <mazal> Oom Kilos you prob know boot-repair hey ?
[10:07] <mazal> I it any good ?
[10:07] <mazal> is even
[10:07] <Kilos> yes it works well on unity
[10:08] <mazal> Busy downloading the boot-repair cd
[10:08] <Kilos> and worked fine on gnome2 as well;
[10:08] <mazal> And will install it on my system as well
[10:09] <mazal> Can it repair the other OS boot as well ?
[10:09] <Kilos> i just installed it straight
[10:09] <Kilos> havent tried to fix the other os as yet
[10:10] <mazal> I want to try , but not really in the mood to brake one of my pc's. Takes too long to fix a Win pc
[10:10] <Kilos> boot-repair works quite fast
[10:11] <mazal> Ja but if it doesn't work on the Win machine and breaks it , I will have to format it :P
[10:12] <Kilos> lol
[10:12] <Kilos> xp or 7
[10:12] <mazal> 7
[10:13] <Kilos> http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32523/how-to-manually-repair-windows-7-boot-loader-problems/
[10:13] <mazal> I will try it on Barry's pc <eg> :)
[10:13] <Kilos> lol
[10:14] <barrydk> i'm watching you stay away!!!!
[10:14] <Kilos> haha
[10:14] <Kilos> now now chillens, play nice
[10:29] <magespawn> when i sudo echo '/user/local/bin/noip2' >> /etc/rc.local
[10:29] <magespawn> i get -bash: /etc/rc.local: Permission denied
[10:30] <magespawn> why?
[10:30] <Kilos> i had to use echo from root itself
[10:30] <Kilos> sudo -i
[10:30] <Kilos> the fly dont advise it though
[10:32] <magespawn> okay
[10:33] <magespawn> seems to work though
[10:35] <superfly> magespawn: because the >> is a second command
[10:41] <inetpro> magespawn: echo hello | sudo tee -a /etc/mynewfile
[10:42] <inetpro> magespawn: BTW there is no /user folder on default linux systems
[10:42] <inetpro> it's /usr
[10:53] <mazal> Is there a difference between sudo -i and sudo su ?
[10:53] <magespawn> Ah ty superfly and inetpro
[11:00] <superfly> mazal: sudo su runs the su command, sudo -i is an interactive sudo session - it's probably safer to use sudo -i
[11:39] <Kilos> hiya magtie 
[11:41] <magtie> Hi Kilos
[12:46] <barrydk> Enjoy the rest of the day see you all tommorrow.
[13:37] <inetpro> theblazehen: welcome to #ubuntu-za
[13:37] <inetpro> Kilos: you forgot to greet?
[13:38] <Kilos> oh my
[13:38] <Kilos> hiya theblazehen 
[13:39] <Kilos> sorry
[13:39] <Kilos> we need to fix that greetr.py script inetpro 
[13:39] <Kilos> greeter
[13:40] <inetpro> Kilos: ek speel net met jou man :-)
[13:40] <Kilos> hehe
[13:52] <Kilos> magespawn, whats happening
[13:54] <Kilos> tumbleweed, you still alive?
[13:56] <Kilos> i need a python pro to sort a greeter script for ibid so it can debug itself
[13:56] <Kilos> http://slexy.org/view/s2EiRdvgOw
[13:59] <tumbleweed> Kilos: hi
[13:59] <Kilos> compliments of the season tumbleweed 
[14:00] <tumbleweed> you too
[14:00] <Kilos> ty
[14:00] <inetpro> wb tumbleweed
[14:00]  * tumbleweed is enjoying an empty office today
[14:01] <Kilos> hehe you got any spare time tumbleweed ?
[14:02] <Kilos> if its you fixes the greeter script we know it will work
[14:02] <magespawn> hey Kilos customers and such
[14:02] <Kilos> ah thats good magespawn thought you crashed
[14:03] <tumbleweed> Kilos: what's the problem with it?
[14:03] <Kilos> it only greeted once tumbleweed 
[14:03] <Kilos> even when no action in channel all day
[14:05] <Kilos> and vhata says get the monkey to add debugging script but he is new to python and dont get to doing it
[14:13] <superfly> heya tumbleweed! hope you had a good time over the holidays :-)
[14:15] <tumbleweed> superfly: yeah, good
[14:17] <superfly> tumbleweed: there are a lot of problems with kbmonkey's Ibid plugin, easily solveable too, I just haven't had the time to look at it
[14:17] <superfly> nice idea, just should be implemented better
[14:19] <tumbleweed> Kilos: works for me
[14:19] <Kilos> oh my
[14:20] <Kilos> where did you put the script in
[14:20] <tumbleweed> into the ibid/plugins directory
[14:20] <Kilos> i have it in an ibid folder in /home
[14:20] <tumbleweed> it needs to be in the ibid/plugins directory in your botdir
[14:21] <Kilos> where is that in ibid.db?
[14:21] <tumbleweed> ibid.db is in your botdir, yes
[14:21] <Kilos> i cant open it so its understandable to me
[14:22] <Kilos> my ibid.db and ibid.ini are in /home
[14:22] <tumbleweed> right, so then this goes into /home/ibid/plugins
[14:22] <Kilos> just loose there where they were installed on ibid-setup
[14:23] <Kilos> oh
[14:23] <Kilos> ok lemme try that ty
[14:26] <Kilos> i made a folder plugins and put it in the folder ibid and greeter in plugins will see if it works now ty
[15:03] <Kilos> ty tumbleweed its working
[15:04] <Kilos> that script is available if anyone wants to use it tumbleweed 
[15:04] <Kilos> like in maaz
[15:04] <Kilos> hehe
[15:05] <Kilos> then i can rest all day
[15:06] <inetpro> Kilos: you want to go on early retirement? 
[15:09] <Kilos> why?
[15:09] <Kilos> ive got lots of work
[15:10] <Kilos> all the iptables and ssh stuff to do again
[15:10] <Kilos> wanna try do it without help this time
[16:04] <Kilos> yo Cantide 
[16:04] <Cantide> hey Kilos :)
[16:47] <inetpro> 1 hour and 12 minutes to go
[16:47] <inetpro> or make that 13
[16:49] <magespawn> inetpro for?
[16:49] <inetpro> magespawn: until some big announcement at http://www.ubuntu.com
[16:50] <magespawn> oh right
[16:50] <Cantide> oh yeah!
[16:50] <Cantide> thanks for reminding me :)
[16:50] <magespawn> any ways, later all. home time
[16:50] <Cantide> what do you guys think it is?
[16:50] <Cantide> bye magespawn '-';
[16:51] <Kilos> toods magespawn 
[16:54] <inetpro> Cantide: I'm sure it has something to do with a mobile device
[16:54] <inetpro> but that is just a guess on my side
[16:54] <Cantide> perhaps Ubuntu for Android
[16:55]  * inetpro is dreaming of a native Ubuntu on a mobile device
[16:55] <Cantide> or an Ubuntu tablet :)
[16:55] <inetpro> but I don't think we are the quite yet
[16:56] <inetpro> probably Ubuntu on a Nexus tablet
[16:56] <Cantide> :)
[16:56] <inetpro> but that wouldn't be new
[16:56] <Cantide> or free space flights to all Ubuntu users '<
[16:56] <Cantide> (okay, that was slightly over-enthusiastic)
[16:56] <inetpro> yeah
[16:57] <Cantide> and perhaps unrealistic :p
[16:57] <inetpro> :-)
[16:57] <Cantide> Haswell support maybe :)
[16:58] <inetpro> haswell?
[16:58] <Cantide> ooooooooooooor Canonical buying Microsoft for 1 USD
[16:58] <Cantide> Haswell is the next range of Intel CPUs to be released mid-year
[16:58] <inetpro> Canonical buying MS!? Hmm....
[16:58] <Cantide> i am being very unrealistic and jumping the gun on many things :p
[16:59] <Cantide> just thinking of what news would make me happiest :p
[17:04] <inetpro> Cantide: check http://ubuntuonair.com/ at 19:45
[17:04] <Cantide> what will be there? 'o'
[17:48] <Cantide> i didn't see anything there :<
[17:49]  * Cantide waits 10 minutes for ubuntu.com
[17:54] <inetpro> 6 minutes
[17:54] <Kilos> hehe
[17:54] <Kilos> are any of you geeks like those in the big bang theory?
[17:55] <inetpro> Cantide: join #ubuntu-discuss
[17:57] <inetpro> 3 minutes to go 
[17:57] <Cantide> hey smileee :)
[17:57] <smileee> hi :D
[17:57] <smileee> indeed :o
[17:57] <smileee> where will the stream become available? :p
[17:57] <smileee> hey Cantide :)
[17:58] <inetpro> 2 minutes
[17:58] <Cantide> smileee, I think ubuntu.com
[17:58] <smileee> :)
[17:59] <smileee> one minute :)
[18:00] <smileee> they're too late
[18:00] <smileee> :p
[18:01] <magespawn> Hey all
[18:01] <smileee> lol, I think ubuntu.com has capacity problems :p
[18:01] <Cantide> yeah
[18:01] <Cantide> haha
[18:02] <magespawn> Mmm i can't get on either
[18:02] <Cantide> just a loading circle thingy for me :<
[18:02] <smileee> yeah, for me too xD
[18:02] <inetpro> hmm...
[18:02] <smileee> and google chrome won't load it :p
[18:02] <smileee> an image is coming, lol
[18:02] <smileee> 0 seconds left
[18:02] <smileee> xD
[18:03] <magespawn> Right am on.
[18:04] <smileee> magespawn: ?? :p
[18:05] <magespawn> Got on to the site
[18:05] <Cantide> I reloaded the page now..
[18:05] <Cantide> ahaaaaaaaa
[18:06] <magespawn> And?
[18:06] <Cantide> '-'
[18:06] <inetpro> http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/2/3827922/ubuntu-phone-os-announcement
[18:08] <inetpro> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpWHJDLsqTU
[18:09] <smileee> pff :(
[18:09] <smileee> we missed it? :(
[18:09] <smileee> he looks bad :o
[18:29] <magespawn> Okay so ubuntu on phones, will be interested to see if it will run on the n900
[18:30] <smileee> magespawn: don't think so :p
[18:32] <magespawn> Maybe not, old equipment
[18:33] <Kilos> yo tux
[18:33] <Kilos> grr
[18:33] <Kilos> tuxmaster, 
[18:33] <inetpro> very interesting
[18:34] <inetpro> only time will tell whether it's good or not
[18:35] <Kilos> do they show you the screen?
[18:35] <Kilos> hopefully not unity
[18:35] <inetpro> certainly a very brave move to do the marketing spiel the way they did today
[18:35] <inetpro> Kilos: of course it's with unity
[18:35] <Kilos> eeeek
[18:36] <Cantide> i was hoping for an OS that ran alongside Android
[18:36] <inetpro> Kilos: see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone/design
[18:36] <Kilos> ty
[18:36] <Cantide> and just turned your phone into a PC in a dock
[18:38] <Kilos> where is the keypad
[18:38] <Kilos> is it one the splits in 2 or touchscreen
[18:40] <inetpro> Kilos: we'll see lots more at CES
[18:42] <Cantide> i assume touchsrceen
[18:42] <Cantide> they didn't show the OSK >.<
[18:42] <Kilos> CES?
[18:43] <inetpro> Kilos: The International CES (CES) is a major technology-related trade show held each January in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.
[18:43] <Kilos> oh ty
[18:43] <inetpro> happening between 8-11 Jan this year
[18:43] <Kilos> im not going there
[18:43] <magespawn> A place i would love to go
[18:43] <smileee> inetpro: too far away
[18:43] <smileee> :p
[18:44] <Kilos> rather improve pc than spend money onna fone
[18:44] <inetpro> I think the aim is to create lots marketing hype building up to the CES
[18:44] <inetpro> to much detail left out today
[18:45] <Kilos> but good news anyway
[18:45] <Kilos> more pressure to winsucks
[18:45] <inetpro> I still think they're a bit brave
[18:46] <inetpro> that's my honest humble opinion
[18:46] <Cantide> it's their whole convergence strategy
[18:46] <inetpro> we're definitely getting closer to a real ubuntu smartphone
[18:46] <Cantide> which is the only reason why it could work
[18:46] <Kilos> thats good though.
[18:46] <inetpro> but I think it will take more time
[18:46] <Kilos> just hope its stable
[18:47] <inetpro> well I think it's good for the whole linux ecosystem
[18:47] <Kilos> yip definitely
[18:51] <magespawn> Night all
[18:52] <Cantide> night magespawn '-'//
[18:53] <inetpro> good night magespawn
[18:53] <inetpro> Cantide: also read http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/01/02/announcing-ubuntu-for-phones/
[18:54]  * Cantide clicks
[18:54] <Cantide> i bet after CES we will know a whole lot more
[18:56] <inetpro> superfly: nie that they chose the best technology (Qt)
[18:56] <inetpro> /nie/nice/
[18:56] <Kilos> night magespawn 
[18:56] <smileee> magespawn: good night
