[01:28] <HowdyDoody> yes, I did
[01:42] <HowdyDoody> I found the 'mystery' stuff using up 12Gigs.
[01:43] <HowdyDoody> All hiding in /root which is not accessible to user.
[02:22] <HowdyDoody> anyone around tonight ?
[02:31] <TheLordOfTime> no
[02:32] <TheLordOfTime> i'm not around, i'm just here.
[02:34] <HowdyDoody> I've just trashed my upgrade to 12.10.   Thought I was clever doing upgrade with disk, chose that option. too.  Buuuut, I also chose the main user and it BLEW away the old /home/user data and gave me a new blank one.   Ugggh.
[02:34] <TheLordOfTime> and now you know why backups are the golden rule of upgrades
[02:35] <HowdyDoody> First fix is /boot has new stuff on it.    And /dev/sda1  has my main boots stuff on it but 12.04 is latest there.
[02:36] <HowdyDoody> I've copied the contents of /boot to /dev/sda1, but I know there is more to do yet.
[02:38] <HowdyDoody> I need to fix grub on /dev/sda1 to utilize the new stuff copied from /boot.  Not sure how to tackle that.
[10:25] <rmg51> Morning

[13:20] <HowdyDoody> Morning
[13:23] <HowdyDoody>   /boot has been fixed, so has nvidia.   The website had a LOT of negative vibes on how ubuntu handles (it doesn't) the install of Nvidia driver.  On to other fixes, now.
