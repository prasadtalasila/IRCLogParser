[21:10] <waltman> So there was some hot soldering action going on in my lab today. Everything was in flux.
[21:13] <teddy-dbear> on that note
[21:13] <waltman> heh
[21:14] <waltman> $labmate was lusting after the wxd2 at http://www.apexhandtools.com/weller/index.cfm
[21:20] <waltman> it's the one in the first image up top
[21:23] <ChinnoDog> rimshot
[21:23] <waltman> at least someone got it!
[21:25] <waltman> I'll be here all night.
[21:26] <waltman> They were fixing a prof's tv set.
[21:27] <ChinnoDog> I would have gotten it in high school. Etching circuit boards in school is fun.
[21:27] <waltman> Turned out to a design flaw in one of the circuit boards. They'd used under-rated capacitors. They pulled them and replaced them with bigger ones. Now it's working again!
[21:27] <waltman> SCIENCE!
[21:27] <waltman> I confess I've never soldered anything
[21:28] <ChinnoDog> It is pretty easy with the right tools
[21:30] <waltman> debugging it was the fun part, of course
[23:19]  * ChinnoDog wonders if Ubuntu Mobile will be better than http://linuxonandroid.org/
[23:20] <jedijf> time to say goodbye to my Treo BT headset - served me well
[23:21] <ChinnoDog> Jabra 250?
[23:22] <jedijf> http://www.mobiletechreview.com/tips/treo-650-wireless-headset.htm
[23:23] <jedijf> that was old one - new one is just cheapest they had at target - bt15 or something - seems to work well
