[17:09] <Daviey> stgraber: Remember last 12.04 point release, there was an issue with some of the meta files?  seems server manifests are missing.. http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/
[17:18] <stgraber> Daviey: manifest are for images containing a livefs, AFAIK 12.04 server doesn't
[17:18] <Daviey> stgraber: Hmm, i thought all iso's had a manifest
[17:19] <stgraber> Daviey: nope, all isos have a .list, livefs have a .manifest on top of that
[17:19] <Daviey> ah, my bad. thanks
[17:20] <Daviey> stgraber: do we also not have src iso's?
[17:21] <stgraber> Daviey: not sure. I know we had issues with those at some point so we might be missing the one for the point release
[17:22] <stgraber> (and I never remember where they're even supposed to show up at...)
[17:25] <cjwatson> we have source isos, they're in cdimage.u.c/source/
[17:26] <cjwatson> generated occasionally manually rather than automatically
[17:26] <cjwatson> generally end up in release directories too
[17:48] <bdmurray> I think given the scope of the change in bug 1027987 a regression test is fine.
[17:48] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1027987 in libvirt (Ubuntu Precise) "Starting libvirtd takes too long because of "udevadm settle" timeout" [Medium,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1027987
[17:48] <bdmurray> so I'm inclined to mark it verification-done and release libvirt
[18:21] <cjwatson> \o/ sivp fixed.  The opencv stack should be able to migrate shortly

[23:52] <slangasek> cjwatson: is it deliberate that the precise daily desktop images include linux-image-3.2.0-36-generic in the apt repo?
[23:56] <infinity> slangasek: I imagine that's more of a bug with how that repository is built.
[23:57] <slangasek> well, I'd like to know for sure before deciding I should go and change it :)
[23:57] <infinity> slangasek: Fair enough.  Maybe Colin has reasons to want that, but I can't fathom what they'd be, since we're telling people who want 3.2.0 to use .1
[23:58] <infinity> (or d-i)
