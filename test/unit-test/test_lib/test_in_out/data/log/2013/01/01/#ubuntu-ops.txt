[00:11] <bazhang> Freedom is just another word...
[07:12] <bazhang> average_drifter is wildly unhelpful
[07:15] <bazhang> his idea of resetting gnome is to remove gnome
[07:15] <elky> lorf
[07:18] <bazhang> whoopsie
[07:18] <bazhang> IdleOne, got the wrong av..
[07:18] <elky> opping while drunk for nye is a bad idea :P
[07:19] <bazhang> heh
[07:19] <IdleOne> drumpklf?
[07:19] <IdleOne> lol
[07:19]  * IdleOne is not drunk but I manage to look like I am sometimes
[07:19] <bazhang> he's back, no doubt to protest the abuse of power
[07:20] <IdleOne> I sent a PM to avelldiroll apologizing
[07:26] <bazhang> <average_drifter> misterno: didn't you know there's a Ubuntu Supreme court ?
[07:27] <IdleOne> there is. We all vote the same way no matter how wrong we all are
[07:27] <bazhang> heh
[07:28] <elky> *cough*sockpuppet*cough*
[07:32] <elky> one more "grep 99999 files" snark, and he's gone. it's typed out waiting
[08:26] <JoseeAntonioR> hey guys, we're having a bot in #ubuntu-uds who is filling the channel with the same message, tried to contact the user unsuccessfully
[08:27] <IdleOne> cyphase?
[08:27] <JoseeAntonioR> IdleOne: yep, repeating 'Happy PST New Year!' for 27mins
[08:27] <JoseeAntonioR> every 4 mins
[08:29] <IdleOne> I don't have access there
[08:30] <IdleOne> seems to have stopped now
[08:31] <JoseeAntonioR> oh well, ok
[08:31] <JoseeAntonioR> but it's still in there and sending the messages :)
[08:32] <JoseeAntonioR> I'll just leave it to the IRCC in case it's still needed (^). Thanks!
[08:38] <Unit193> Should be fixed now.

[14:22] <phix> hey, can I come back in yet?
[15:45] <k1l> hey phix, can you come back in the next days? seems like most ops are afk today and i wont decide on your ban because there is alot case history on your person with several bans.
[16:16] <k1l> phix: ping
[16:20] <IdleOne> alright. I got this.
[16:20] <IdleOne> phix: I spoke with a couple of the ops and we feel that given your fairly long history of being removed and banned from #ubuntu that perhaps #ubuntu is not the right channel for you. Your style of support and general attitude towards other users is not compatible with the Ubuntu spirit. We are not going to remove the ban.
[16:20] <IdleOne> If you feel this decision is wrong feel free to email the Ubuntu IRC council, see /msg ubottu !appeals

[23:02] <MoL0ToV_> hi to all! someone can unban my host from #ubuntu channel?
[23:06] <k1l_> MoL0ToV_: hi, you know why you were kicked and banned this morning?
[23:07] <MoL0ToV_> yes..
[23:07] <MoL0ToV_> i was offtopic i think
[23:07] <MoL0ToV_> but i have no posted offensive message for none... so..
[23:07] <k1l_> yes and your language was not right for the supportchannel.
[23:08] <k1l_> did you read the guidelines meanwhile?
[23:08] <MoL0ToV_> yes
[23:08] <k1l_> !guidelines | MoL0ToV_
[23:08] <ubottu> MoL0ToV_: The guidelines for using the Ubuntu channels can be found here: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines
[23:09] <MoL0ToV_> but i think that the ban is excessive for sayng something like me..
[23:09] <k1l_> so can you agree on them and will keep the offtopic to the offtopic channel (#ubuntu-offtopic) and the language appropriate for a familyfriendly support channel?
[23:09] <MoL0ToV_> nexttime i sayhappy new year and stop ;)
[23:10] <k1l_> MoL0ToV_: if you agree i am willing to unban you.
[23:10] <MoL0ToV_> ok
[23:12] <k1l_> MoL0ToV_: ok i unbanned you. so in future please stick to the guidelines. if you have questions on that or want to talk about a operators action please join this channel here. thanks
[23:13] <MoL0ToV_> ok thx
