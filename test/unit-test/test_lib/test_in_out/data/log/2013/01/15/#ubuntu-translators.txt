[08:46] <dpm> morning all, did the latest Firefox update on Quantal break translations for anyone else? My Firefox loads the English translations only
[08:46] <dpm> Gwaihir around? ^
[08:47] <Gwaihir> hey dpm!
[08:47] <dpm> hey :)
[08:47] <Gwaihir> am still on precise... :-)
[08:48] <dpm> :)
[08:48] <Gwaihir> but firefox here works normal, loading the italian interface
[08:48] <dpm> Gwaihir, ah, but perhaps you could confirm there, as the FF update should be the same. Are you running Firefox 18.0?
[08:48] <Gwaihir> yep, 18, and it is in italian
[08:48] <dpm> bummer
[08:49] <dpm> I mean... good for you :)
[08:49] <dpm> but not for me
[08:49] <Gwaihir> apart the usual plug-ins and extension checking window that I have never seen in Italian
[08:49] <dpm> yeah
[08:49] <dpm> it's an upstream bug that one
[08:50] <Gwaihir> OT, but always translation, on a quantal machine I have, the bit that I do not see in italian, is the calender in the top-bar though
[08:51] <dpm> Gwaihir, which particular bit of the calendar you don't see translated?
[08:51] <Gwaihir> when I clic on the clock, the days are still in english
[08:57] <dpm> hm, weird, I haven't seen that one happening
[08:58] <dpm> Mirv or askhl, do you happen to be on quantal and running firefox 18? Is the UI translated?
[09:23] <Mirv> dpm: sorry, no quantal machine at the moment, only precise + raring
[09:23] <dpm> Mirv, argh, so you just had to skip the one to reproduce this, right? :P
[09:29] <Mirv> yes, for now :) I'm planning to install q to a spare computer at some point
[12:10] <trijntje_> dpm: ff 18 is also translated here for dutch
[12:11] <dpm> bummer, it seems to be either only Catalan, or just my system. Thanks trijntje_ for testing
=== trijntje_ is now known as trijntje
