[02:58] <not_found> night (or I should say morning)
[04:43] <Squirm> ah
[04:43] <Squirm> too early
[05:07] <Kilos> morning weekenders
[05:21] <Kilos> http://blog.osvdb.org/2013/01/22/everything-is-vulnerable-even-security-software
[05:22] <Kilos> interesting read. I wonder what drives the bad guys. revenge for some imagined affront or warped psyches
[06:02] <inetpro> Kilos: ahh, you read my g+ stream?
[06:02] <inetpro> good morning
[06:03] <Kilos> ya on twitter messages i get in mail
[06:03] <inetpro> hmm.. ok
[06:03]  * Kilos gets twitter feedback in mail
[06:03] <Kilos> and here is sit no fw even
[06:03] <inetpro> Kilos: that is only what they think might be interesting to you
[06:04] <Kilos> well they think what you say at times has some substance
[06:04] <Kilos> hehe
[06:04] <inetpro> lol
[06:04] <inetpro> at least
[06:04] <Kilos> haha
[06:05] <Kilos> so you can have a peaceful family weekend with work stuff fixed
[06:06]  * inetpro was just getting happy that he was starting to become a normal citizen again, browsing away on the interwebs
[06:06] <Kilos> lol
[06:07] <inetpro> Kilos: to be honest, we only left the office at about 21:00 last night
[06:07] <inetpro> fixing all kinds of things that needed fixing
[06:07] <Kilos> ouch. but its fixed right?
[06:08] <inetpro> sad part of it is that it didn't even make a dent in the list of things that still need to be done
[06:08] <Kilos> ou
[06:08] <inetpro> in IT sysadmin there's always more to be done
[06:09] <inetpro> so don't say I didn't warn you
[06:09] <Kilos> lol i can never get there man
[06:09] <Kilos> will leave that to the clever peeps
[06:09] <inetpro> haha
[06:09] <inetpro> Kilos: you are the clever peep
[06:10] <Kilos> with farming maybe
[06:10] <Kilos> even then i sukkel to member sometimes
[06:11] <Kilos> thats why i gave you and mage that info the other day while it popped up in head
[06:11] <Kilos> remember cypermethrin
[06:11] <inetpro> yep
[06:11]  * inetpro will have to get that
[06:12] <Kilos> can save a fortune making your own pour on for ticks and flees for years outa one tin of it
[06:15] <superfly> Kilos: cypermethrin?
[06:15] <Kilos> hi superfly its mix they use in pour ons for dogs
[06:16] <Kilos> the active insecticide i think its called
[06:16] <Kilos> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypermethrin
[06:17] <Kilos> i hope that one explains it
[06:17] <Kilos> also works for flies
[06:19] <Kilos> you mix about 10ml in a spray with about 5 or 7 litres water with a cup of sugar in and spray all over outside and it attracts flies and as soon as they walk on it they start doing a dance for a bit then spin till they fall over dead
[06:20] <Kilos> especially spray onto dog and animal droppings where they lay eggs
[06:20] <Kilos> but even on windows and places where flies gather
[06:20] <Kilos> uh oh
[06:20] <Kilos> no
[06:21] <Kilos> sorry thats another one
[06:21] <Kilos> methinks methomex
[06:21] <Kilos> i try find
[06:22] <Kilos> http://www.ma-industries.com/item-data/categoryid/3/brandnameid/51
[06:40] <Kilos> methomex is a good insecticide for gardeners
[06:46] <magespawn> good morning
[06:46] <Kilos> hi mage
[06:46] <Kilos> ai magespawn 
[06:47] <magespawn> discussing farming and dips again i see
[06:47] <magespawn> #ubuntu-za-vet
[06:47] <Kilos> lol
[06:49] <Kilos> i gotta share things when i remember them or they gone for months again
[06:49] <Kilos> like gotta start sshing all over again
[06:51] <magespawn> maybe write them into a text file called Kilos Wisdom
[06:52] <Kilos> rofl
[06:52] <Kilos> i will lose that too. even lost my curry recipe
[06:54] <magespawn> do you have ubuntu-one?
[06:54] <Kilos> yes
[06:54] <Kilos> and dropbox somewhere
[06:55] <magespawn> put the folder Wisdom in one of those then share with someone here
[06:56] <Kilos> thats an idea
[06:56] <Kilos> but you were supposed to save the info too dodo
[06:56] <magespawn> i do most of the time, but this way it is automatically
[06:57] <Kilos> but you been busy i know
[06:57] <Kilos> ok ill try find what i said
[06:58] <magespawn> i think i have the curry recipe in my drop box
[07:03] <Kilos> lol
[07:11] <magespawn> maybe not, but i do have it .... somewhere
[07:11] <Kilos> np now
[07:12] <Kilos> i can make it with everything around to look through
[07:12] <magespawn> my trick is to try and limit the places i have to look
[07:12] <Kilos> lol
[07:13] <Kilos> my poor desktop is fulla stuff. when i place in folders somewhere i can never remember which one or where
[07:16] <Kilos> hows the hotel job coming magespawn ?
[07:22] <magespawn> looks like it is sorted out
[07:22] <Kilos> good
[07:23] <magespawn> still not sure what caused the initial problem though so bit wierd
[07:25] <magespawn> oh and yesterday their ups decided to melt
[07:25] <Kilos> ou
[07:25] <magespawn> boil its batteries etc
[07:25] <Kilos> overloaded or over charging
[07:27] <magespawn> over charging i think
[07:27] <magespawn> wonderful smell

[15:12] <Kilos> hi Mezenir 
[15:12] <Kilos> didnt know there are simple fixes with pc's
=== Trix[a]r_za is now known as Trixar_za

[15:41] <Kilos> lol youre lucky day
[15:50] <Kilos> your
[15:53] <Kilos> magespawn, what doing
[15:53] <Kilos> ?
[15:53] <Kilos> you on fone?
[15:57] <magespawn> no i am at the shop busy doing studying and admin
[15:57] <Kilos> can you tell me about this link
[15:57] <Kilos> http://nostar.ch/BoG_promo
[15:57] <Kilos> where do you click to get the free ebook
[15:58] <Kilos> 0ver 600 pages of gimp
[15:59] <magespawn> the book is not free only 40% off
[15:59] <Kilos> it says free ebook
[15:59] <Kilos> Print books come with free ebook editions (DRM-free, of course).
[15:59] <Kilos> whatever that means
[16:00] <magespawn> yeah but you have to buy the print book first
[16:00] <Kilos> oh ok ty
[16:00] <Kilos> thats sad
[16:01] <magespawn> cost $49.95 with 40% percent off and a free ebook
[16:01] <magespawn> or the ebook only for $39.95
[16:01] <Kilos> ai
[16:01] <Kilos> thats big bucks for a book hey
[16:02] <magespawn> but since it is in dollars i don't suppose they include delivery here
[16:02] <magespawn> about R450.00 so about the going rate for a computer book here
[16:03] <Kilos> whew
[16:03] <magespawn> the two sections of books that always seem to be expensive are IT and business
[16:05] <not_found> alo SA
[16:06] <Kilos> hi neelsie
[16:06] <magespawn> hey not_found
[16:06] <not_found> alo uncle Kilos , magespawn 
[16:07] <Kilos> magespawn, we need to find a rich guy to buy the book and share the ebook
[16:07] <Kilos> with us
[16:07] <magespawn> indeed, sharing the ebook maybe against the copyright though
[16:08] <Kilos> ai
[16:08] <Trixar_za> I can think of one place where you can get it, but it won't exactly be legal :/
[16:08] <Kilos> can i get caught
[16:08] <Trixar_za> Not unless you sell it
[16:09] <not_found> if it is worth it then you won't mind paying...
[16:09] <Kilos> i want it for me to learn gimp not to make money out of it
[16:09] <Kilos> the pro would say man gimp
[16:09] <Kilos> ai!\
[16:10] <Trixar_za> Well, I tend to get most books from Undernet
[16:10] <not_found> there is enough free resources on GIMP on the net
[16:10] <Trixar_za> There is one guy (ps is his nick) that runs a mIRC file server
[16:10] <Trixar_za> He has most manuals on it
[16:10] <Trixar_za> Might not be the newest manual though
[16:11] <Kilos> talk nicely too him
[16:14] <Trixar_za> Incidentally
[16:14] <Trixar_za> http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK/
[16:14] <Trixar_za> I found that book pretty nice
[16:14] <Kilos> ty Trixar_za 
[16:15] <Kilos> oh my i downloaded that last year i think
[16:15] <not_found> Kilos: http://www.gimp.org/docs/ lots of resources (if you haven't had a look yet)
[16:15] <Kilos> but maybe its gone with all the new installs
[16:15] <Kilos> ty not_found 
[16:19] <Trixar_za> Nope
[16:19] <Trixar_za> don't have that book
[16:20] <Trixar_za> but they do have Beginning GIMP: From Novice to Professional, 2nd Edition
[16:20] <Kilos> size?
[16:21] <Trixar_za> 27.9MB
[16:21] <Trixar_za> as a pdf file
[16:22] <Kilos> can manage that
[16:23] <Kilos> its near the end of my 2 months 2+1 8ta bundle
[16:23] <Trixar_za> k
[16:23] <Kilos> so not wasting till the 1st
[16:23] <Trixar_za> You'll have to connect to Undernet and join #bookz though
[16:23] <Trixar_za> :P
[16:23] <Kilos> lol
[16:23] <Trixar_za> And type the following in the channel: !Zilnof Peck - Beginning GIMP - From Novice to Pro 2e (Apress, 2009).pdf
[16:24] <Kilos> here on irc?
[16:24] <Trixar_za> Yeah, they will send you the book over DCC
[16:24] <Kilos> whew
[16:24] <Trixar_za> In XChat it just dumps the files in your home directory
[16:24] <Trixar_za> :P
[16:25] <magespawn> later all, home time or wife will shoot me
[16:25] <Kilos> ty. i go try find undernet
[16:26] <Kilos> toods magespawn 
[16:26] <Kilos> tell her please dont
[16:26] <Trixar_za> Should be in your /server database :P
[16:26] <Kilos> ty Trixar_za 
[16:26] <Trixar_za> /server Undernet - although it will try eu.undernet first
[16:26] <Trixar_za> us.undernet servers work better
[16:26] <Trixar_za> It's kind of a pain to get connected
[16:27] <Trixar_za> lol
[16:27] <Trixar_za> Probably should have warned him about not typing /list
[16:28] <Kilos> eeek chucked me off freenode
[16:28] <not_found> lol
[16:28] <Trixar_za> Only because you type /server here
[16:29] <Trixar_za> Make a new tab first :P
[16:30] <Kilos> is this the one?
[16:30] <Kilos>  us.undernet.org
[16:31] <Trixar_za> Yeah
[16:31] <Trixar_za> not all the servers connect
[16:31] <Kilos> i learned something new again yay
[16:31] <Trixar_za> try for mesa.az.us.undernet.org
[16:31] <not_found> ah undernet... like Hilbrow... only scarier... 
[16:31] <Trixar_za> It'll ask you to quote something though
[16:31] <Kilos> didnt know about the new tab thing in xchat
[16:32] <Trixar_za> just copy and paste that. Mine was /QUOTE PASS 10763
[16:32] <Trixar_za> Ctrl+T
[16:32] <Trixar_za> Just like Firefox if I remember correctly
[16:32] <Trixar_za> lol
[16:33] <Kilos> slow down
[16:33] <Kilos> its there no says found my ip
[16:33] <Kilos> s/no/now/
[16:33] <Kilos> now gotta /j hey
[16:34] <Trixar_za> Yeah
[16:34] <Kilos> ok
[16:35] <Kilos>  /j who
[16:35] <Kilos> #undernet
[16:35] <Trixar_za> #bookz
[16:35] <Kilos> oh ya
[16:35] <Kilos> sjoe
[16:35] <Kilos> ty
[16:35] <Kilos> you got head spinning
[16:35] <Trixar_za> lol, there you are
[16:36] <Kilos> whew so many peeps there
[16:36] <Trixar_za> Well, it is one of the oldest IRC networks around :P
[16:36] <Trixar_za> Now just type !Zilnof Peck - Beginning GIMP - From Novice to Pro 2e (Apress, 2009).pdf
[16:36] <Trixar_za> and he'll add you to his send queue
[16:37] <Trixar_za> Depending on your place, it can take between 1 and 5 minutes before he starts sending
[16:38] <not_found> uncle Kilos now going really old school for his warez
[16:38] <Trixar_za> True that :P
[16:38] <Kilos> i cant keep up there
[16:39] <Trixar_za> Nobody can
[16:39] <Trixar_za> It's not really a chat channel
[16:39] <Trixar_za> Actually, it's not at all.  They frown on chatting in there
[16:39] <Kilos> oh does a bot do all the work?
[16:39] <Kilos> one person could never cope
[16:40] <Trixar_za> XDCC scripts mostly
[16:40] <Kilos> how do you see when you are answered or its started sending
[16:40] <Trixar_za> That's why you're getting CTCP requests the whole time too
[16:40] <Trixar_za> They send you a NOTICE
[16:40] <Kilos> there in the channel
[16:41] <Kilos> ill miss it
[16:41] <Trixar_za> Helps if you have a window open
[16:41] <Trixar_za> And you'll get asked if you want to download the file when they send it
[16:41] <Trixar_za> with a xchat dialog
[16:42] <Kilos> xchat will bloep me hey
[16:42] <Trixar_za> Yeah
[16:42] <Kilos> they will surely use my nick
[16:42] <Trixar_za> That's where me and Squirm get all our books
[16:42] <Trixar_za> :P
[16:42] <Trixar_za> Which we then convert into ebooks
[16:42] <Kilos> Squirm, and I
[16:42] <Trixar_za> bleh, damn enter key
[16:42] <Kilos> ah that will be next
[16:43] <Kilos> i have some others i cant copy paste from the pdf thing
[16:43] <Trixar_za> I meant to say, then we convert them into ebooks we can use on a ebook reader or our cellphones
[16:43] <Kilos> sjoe
[16:45] <Trixar_za> Example: http://brenton.nom.za/books/
[16:45] <Trixar_za> :p
[16:46] <Kilos> if its illegal the fly gonna fight me
[16:46] <Trixar_za> Well, it's only illegal if your mass distribute it against the authors will or sell it
[16:47] <not_found> hmmm... depends on the licesnse
[16:47] <Trixar_za> Fair use protects copies your use for yourself
[16:47] <Trixar_za> s/your/you
[16:47] <Kilos> ah thats all i want
[16:47] <not_found> again remember that free as in freedom of speech != free as in beer
[16:48] <Trixar_za> Mind you, you need to actually own the original for fair use to apply, but yeah
[16:48] <not_found> depending on the author they may expect monitory returns on using there work...
[16:48] <not_found> lol
[16:48] <Trixar_za> Well, as I see it, they're making money off FREE Software
[16:48] <not_found> so uncle Kilos ... just buy the book then you can have a free copy of it ;)
[16:49] <not_found> Trixar_za: again... don't mistake the two freedoms...
[16:49] <not_found> gimp decided to make it free as in beer...
[16:49] <not_found> my work on how to use it is not the software you are using
[16:49] <Kilos> lol not_found im trying to save for faster hardware for my pc
[16:50] <Trixar_za> Still somewhat a derivative of free software and documentation
[16:50] <not_found> *sigh*
[16:50]  * not_found has not the will
[16:52] <Trixar_za> I get what your saying, but the research was free, the reference documentation was free and the software was free. All probably protected by some CC or GPL license. Yet they charge for the finished book based on derivative works.
[16:53] <Trixar_za> Then again, one of the freedoms of free software is the right to sell it
[16:54]  * not_found leaves Trixar_za to argue with himself.. he seems to be doing a good job for both sides
[16:54] <Kilos> lol
[16:58] <Trixar_za> I'm an open source and free software supporter
[16:58] <Trixar_za> We have to be confused, otherwise things don't make sense
[16:59] <not_found> yet you take bread from the table of others that create needed infrastructure for the thing you support... hmmm
[16:59] <Kilos> is it that raw.php stuff in home Trixar_za ?
[16:59] <Trixar_za> Tell that to Metallica or Lady Gaga
[17:00] <Trixar_za> No, it will be named the same as the file you requested
[17:00] <Vince-0> peeps, my interjection: open =! free
[17:00] <Kilos> oh it opened another window here to accept
[17:00] <not_found> Vince-0: +1
[17:01]  * not_found isn't sure why lady gaga would write a book about gimp then again I don't know her that well
[17:01] <Kilos> aw failed
[17:01] <Trixar_za> Point is, no matter how undesirable or what action they take, they'll always have fans defending them to death
[17:02] <not_found> so your a fan and even if wrong you will defend your point?
[17:02] <Vince-0> for open to thrive in business it can't be free, otherwise open will just be a hobby
[17:03] <Trixar_za> Metallica for example sued it's fans over mp3 downloads - even IF they owned the album and were using them in a fair manner
[17:03] <Trixar_za> yet we still have idiots in this country hyped up to go watch those idiots
[17:03] <Vince-0> art licensing is another story
[17:04] <Vince-0> and mostly a matter of opinion
[17:05] <Vince-0> Machinehead's front man vowes to never buy another physical album, also a recent interview with Maynard from Tool etc - he has the opposite view
[17:05] <not_found> Trixar_za: I am still not getting how you are tying this to the original point about downloading a book for free without paying... Do you own the book and feel agreived because you are not allowed a digital copy... no...
[17:05] <Kilos> not_found, maybe you can get chemical engineering stuff there
[17:05] <Trixar_za> You could probably also get it from DukeRaoul: !dukeraoul Beginning GIMP - From Novice to Pro 2e (Apress, 2009) - Peck.pdf
[17:06] <Kilos> play nice guys
[17:06] <Vince-0> ya those are mostly pirate books are they not (in that channel) ?
[17:06] <Kilos> ?
[17:06] <Trixar_za> No, it's the actual file. Somebody paid for it and downloaded a digital copy.
[17:06] <not_found> Vince-0: obviously
[17:06] <not_found> Trixar_za: someone else
[17:06] <not_found> not you
[17:07] <not_found> or uncle Kilos 
[17:07] <Kilos> not me
[17:07] <Vince-0> ya I buy books from Packt publishing with my darned name and address printed in it
[17:07]  * Kilos innocent
[17:07] <not_found> Kilos: for now ;)
[17:07] <Kilos> no if its illegal then i gotta stay away
[17:07] <superfly> that's interesting, never knew I was a duke...
[17:07] <Kilos> the fly will kick ban me
[17:08]  * Trixar_za rolls eyes
[17:08]  * not_found lurks and waits for dinner
[17:09] <Kilos> superfly, ?
[17:09] <Trixar_za> It's questionable. Depending on the country and it's laws, it may be consider illegal or not.
[17:09] <Trixar_za> I'm pretty sure about American law, but not our own regarding it
[17:09] <Vince-0> indeed, ZA will have little motivation to enforce that law
[17:10] <Trixar_za> It has little motivation to enforce parking fines between provinces, so copyright violations should take a similar backseat
[17:11] <not_found> and that makes it ok
[17:11] <Vince-0> no, no it doesn't 
[17:11] <Vince-0> the most I've seen or heard of is about ISPs sending notices about movie pirating
[17:12] <Trixar_za> Well, let me put it like this. I'm unemployed and I have very little money to throw around, much less online. So you're telling me, I have to pay for books in US dollars to supplement my skills rather than downloading a good book that I won't sell or even share with others.
[17:13] <Kilos> Trixar_za, it failed so maybe im not meant to get it
[17:13] <Kilos> and no data to try again
[17:13] <Kilos> groggin the gimp is free i think
[17:13] <Kilos> had it before
[17:13] <Trixar_za> grokking
[17:14] <Vince-0> Trixar_za, just don't tell anyone - its a moral dilemma 
[17:14] <Kilos> that thing
[17:14] <not_found> Trixar_za: you are more than welcome to keep telling yourself what you need to hear... I will sit back and not bother you anymore... good night
[17:15] <Trixar_za> So I'm morally inferior because I want to better myself while I'm in the so-called gutter. Well thank you. 
[17:15] <Vince-0> if you like
[17:15] <Kilos> no guys. dont sling mu
[17:15] <Kilos> we all friends here
[17:15] <Vince-0> I'm saying , be aware. There is also another aspect to promoting it
[17:15] <Kilos> mud
[17:17] <Trixar_za> We're more a bunch of guys (and the occasional girl) hanging around on outdated chat medium
[17:18] <Kilos> yeah but its ours
[17:18] <Vince-0> IRC is still very relevant, especially to software projects
[17:18] <Kilos> ubuntu was built on irc
[17:19] <Kilos> the original guys all worked from irc
[17:19] <Trixar_za> IRC is being superseded by other forms of chat
[17:19] <Kilos> with
[17:19] <Trixar_za> By the looks of it, XMPP is the golden child protocol right now
[17:20] <Kilos> as in used in pidgin?
[17:20] <Kilos> gtalk thing
[17:20] <Kilos> jabber thing
[17:20] <Trixar_za> Gtalk, Jabber, Facebook Chat and Whatsapp
[17:21] <Trixar_za> Mxit too if you count South Africa :P
[17:21] <Kilos> mxit is world wide too
[17:21] <Vince-0> xmpp is very different from IRC regarding channels, operators, auth etc
[17:21] <Vince-0> xmpp is more just message passing
[17:21] <Kilos> boet used it from saudi arabia and tara uses it from aus
[17:21] <Vince-0> so it still needs all manner of application to enable user functionality,
[17:22] <Trixar_za> It's support is pretty interesting
[17:22] <not_found> dinner time
[17:22] <Vince-0> mxit hacked xmpp up
[17:22] <Trixar_za> So did Whatsapp
[17:23] <Vince-0> siff networks those, imho
[17:23] <Trixar_za> but it still uses many of the inhered features for XMPP
[17:23] <Trixar_za> Yeah, they keep changing it to keep people from hacking into Whatsapp with a desktop client
[17:23] <Vince-0> walled garden / closed comms network is a silly idea
[17:24] <Trixar_za> https://github.com/venomous0x/WhatsAPI
[17:25] <digigram> evening all
[17:25] <Kilos> hi digigram 
[17:25] <digigram> hey Kilos
[17:25] <Vince-0> surp
[17:25] <superfly> mxit closed themselves up for a long time, but eventually gave in and open-sourced some of their stuff
[17:26] <Trixar_za> Speaking of which, isn't IRC turning 30 this year?
[17:26] <superfly> something like that... there was a nice write-up/interview with the guy who "invented" it 
[17:27] <Trixar_za> Not "invented", he WiZ DID invent it
[17:27] <Trixar_za> Others just improved on it
[17:28] <Trixar_za> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarkko_Oikarinen
[17:29] <superfly> ja, him
[17:30] <Trixar_za> Oh wait, no, it's 25 this year
[17:30] <Trixar_za> August 1988
[17:30] <Trixar_za> Wish the bugger noted the date
[17:32] <Vince-0> So! Trixar_za do you do graphics art etc?
[17:32] <Trixar_za> I've done the odd logo design
[17:32] <Trixar_za> Mostly by stumbling through GIMP
[17:32] <Trixar_za> :P
[17:32] <Vince-0> nice, I'm no artist
[17:32] <Trixar_za> But if it wasn't for free online guides, I probably would never have learned half of what I know
[17:33] <Vince-0> same for me and Linux stuff
[17:34] <Mezenir> hi kilos
[17:34] <Mezenir> hi all
[17:34] <Vince-0> surp
[17:34] <Kilos> whats surp Vince-0 ?
[17:34] <Vince-0> Sup! /Whatsup/What is up
[17:35] <Kilos> oh sup
[17:35] <Kilos> wassup
[17:36] <Vince-0> Forgive my slang, it is not becomming
[17:36] <Vince-0> er /becoming
[17:36] <Trixar_za> Always interesting how slang comes into existence
[17:37] <Kilos> i think its from peeps being to lazy to use the correct language to start with
[17:37] <Vince-0> oh I just made that up one day. I do prefer complete sentences when conversing
[17:37] <Trixar_za> I tend to use contractions more myself
[17:38] <Trixar_za> I even shorten people's names
[17:38] <Kilos> it seems to be the modern way
[17:39] <Vince-0> There is enough misunderstanding on-line as it is I guess: eg our previous discussion
[17:41] <Trixar_za> At least we're not using Mxit speak
[17:41] <Trixar_za> They make everything a acronym
[17:41] <Trixar_za> an*
[17:41] <Vince-0> Now that I detest especially when its in a work environment LOL
[17:42] <Vince-0> as if the number of characters determines the message cost or something
[18:02] <not_found> Trixar_za: Just want to apologize for earlier... I am not judging you are your circumstances and hope you all the best in your en-devours... No hard feelings I hope?
[18:03] <Trixar_za> None what so ever
[18:03] <Kilos> wb not_found tummy full?
[18:03] <Trixar_za> I've learned not to taking things on the internet too seriously
[18:03] <not_found> k cool... I am glad :)
[18:03] <Trixar_za> otherwise I'd be angry all the time
[18:03] <not_found> yes thanks uncle Kilos ... now if I wasn't at work it would be "magie vol, ogies toe"
[18:04] <Kilos> lol
[18:04] <Kilos> weird how the tummy muscles try close eyes when tummy full hey
[18:04] <Kilos> lekker to nap after a good meal
[18:05] <not_found> :)
[18:06] <Kilos> i cant fight with anyone here cause everyone has helped me
[18:06] <not_found> anyway uncle Kilos ... the tutorials under GIMP I linked to earlier are very good at showing step by step how to do certain things in GIMP ... very nice if you like to learn by seeing and then trying... also if you enjoy those you should try inkscape... there is one guy that has done some brilliant tutorials on how to use it... very simple to follow and lots of fun 
[18:07] <Kilos> oh must i go the tutorials path
[18:07] <Kilos> ty nlsthzn_ will do it
[18:07] <Kilos> simple is good
[18:08] <Kilos> oh my
[18:08] <not_found> sometimes the easiest way to learn... see then do :)
[18:08] <Kilos> im so used to typing nl tab
[18:08] <Trixar_za> I'm more a practical learner myself
[18:08] <Kilos> im too doff Trixar_za 
[18:08] <Kilos> dont understand greek
[18:09] <Kilos> like man pages eeek
[18:09] <Trixar_za> I use SliTaz
[18:09] <Trixar_za> we don't have man pages :P
[18:09] <Kilos> ah
[18:10] <not_found> wonder when they will become more political correct and call them person pages...
[18:10] <Kilos> lol
[18:10] <Kilos> him/her pages
[18:10] <not_found> :)
[18:11] <Kilos> thats what theyare doing with the bible isnt it
[18:11] <Trixar_za> Probably would be more accurate to call them women pages
[18:11] <Trixar_za> woman*
[18:11] <Trixar_za> It's long, technical and confusing with a logic of it's own
[18:11] <Kilos> for me ya i battle to understand them
[18:11] <Trixar_za> That's a woman alright
[18:12]  * not_found already had piracy tonight, not going religion and/or gender... uh uh...
[18:12]  * not_found lurks
[18:12] <Kilos> rofl
[18:12] <Trixar_za> It's a joke not_found
[18:12] <Trixar_za> :P
[18:13] <Kilos> or politics
[18:13]  * not_found lurks harder
[18:13] <Kilos> lol
[18:13] <Trixar_za> I do kind of understand women. They have the same desires and drives as men, so human nature explains them pretty well already
[18:13] <Vince-0> "Don't try to understand women. Only women understand women and they don't like each other" - The Internet
[18:13] <Trixar_za> They just express it differently
[18:15] <Trixar_za> lol
[18:16] <Trixar_za> Well, women have to deal with the slut factor, which is why they sometimes act contrary to their desires
[18:16] <Trixar_za> Slut Factor: Actions that may get one labeled as a slut or slutty
[18:17] <Trixar_za> It's also my theory on why gay men get laid more
[18:17] <Kilos> eeek
[18:17] <Kilos> not here man
[18:17] <Kilos> too far off topic
[18:17] <Trixar_za> True :P
[18:18] <Trixar_za> It's just one of the things on my mind. I'm compiling some ideas together so I can use it to write a script or something
[18:19] <Trixar_za> a manuscript that is
[18:22] <inetpro> hmm...
[18:26]  * not_found is lurking so hard he isn't even seen typing how hard he lurks
[18:26] <Kilos> lol
[18:26] <Kilos> naand inetpro 
[18:36] <Kilos> hmm...
[18:39] <Trixar_za> Anyway, I think piracy is the wrong word. It's unauthorized duplication, or a bootleg copy
[18:40] <Kilos> Maaz, hmm...
[18:40] <Maaz> hmm... is often used to try make others believe one is actually thinking
[18:46] <Trixar_za> Which means Maaz does it a lot
[18:46] <Kilos> hehe
[18:46] <Kilos> no man maaz is clever and answers quickly
[18:47] <Kilos> only sometimes he says oops google couldnt find anything
[18:47] <superfly> so, in other news, the wife also likes Ingress
[18:48] <Kilos> great
[18:51] <not_found> superfly: :) nice... I am still thinking of playing it ...
[19:03] <Kilos> night all. sleep tight
[19:16] <inetpro> ai!
=== Trixar_za is now known as Trix[a]r_za
[19:35] <not_found> inetpro: what's up ?
[19:36] <inetpro> not_found: not much I guess
[19:36] <not_found> ah ok ...
[19:37] <inetpro> was just surprised to see kilos leaving just before I came in
[19:37]  * inetpro was searching for cars again today
[19:38] <inetpro> very tough to find something decent in the 7 seater range
[19:41] <not_found> oh wow
[19:41] <not_found> I can imagine
=== Trix[a]r_za is now known as Trixar_za
[19:46] <inetpro> so many in the luxury range
[19:47]  * inetpro don't need luxury, just need a basic practical vehicle that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to keep on the road
[19:48] <inetpro> I guess the Toyota Avanza comes closest to that but is not even cheap
=== Trixar_za is now known as Trix[a]r_za
[20:01] <not_found> pity they don't make the original combi anymore
[20:11] <inetpro> Perhaps I should just buy my first ever vehicle out of the box, the DFSK LOADHOPPER 1.3 Mini Bus? http://bit.ly/X0F2fA
