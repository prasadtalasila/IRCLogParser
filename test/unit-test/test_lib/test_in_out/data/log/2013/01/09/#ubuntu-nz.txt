[01:05] <G> hads: those NUCs sound interesting, where did you get yours from?
[02:10] <hads> G: Ingram
[03:13] <G> hads: ahhh right, essentially direct, got a mild case of envy now :)
[03:17] <lifeless> hads: is it quiet ?
[08:44] <hads> G: I can hook you up :)
[08:44] <hads> lifeless: I haven't had a chance to even plug it in yet, will report back.
[08:44] <hads> It feels and looks really nice though.
[08:47] <hads> lifeless: There's a silentpcreview review of it saying that it's basically inaudible so that says something.
[08:49] <G> hads: whats the story re: storage?  or can it do something fancy like boot-from-iscsi direct from the BIOS?
[08:57] <G> hads: if I'm not mistaken from what I'm reading, mSATA?
[09:23] <hads> G: Yeah, mSATA
[09:24] <hads> This one has a 40GB Intel module in it.
[09:29] <lifeless> 40GB lol
[09:29] <lifeless> I am considering something like that as a ancilliary video store
[09:29] <G> hads: that sounds quite neat to be honest
[09:30] <lifeless> would want das of 200GB or so, plus networked for all the big stuff :)
[09:30] <G> hads: I purchased a Synology NAS the other month so it'd fit in nice
[09:39] <G> hmmm the manual is interesting compatibility matrix for BIOS recovery specifically says that BIOS Recovery via 1.4MB Floppy is unsupported
[09:44] <G> hads: one crazy thing I'd be interested when you get it going, is if KVM is really supported on it  (i.e. vmx in /proc/cpuinfo, and what not), ark.intel.com says that the CPU does, not sure if I believe it or not :)
[09:45] <lifeless> G: cpu will, whether its bios supported is another q :)
[09:45] <G> lifeless: hence the believe it or not
[09:45] <lifeless> :)
[09:46] <G> lifeless: to be honest, knowing Intel, I'd expect it to be there
[09:47] <G> but as anyone who knows me well would say, I could be easily admitted to cynics anonymous
[10:50] <hads> This will probably end up running XBMC I imagine. All storage here is off a server so nothing over about 10G is needed for clients.
[10:50] <hads> Will check the VM capability when I run it up.
[10:51] <hads> I was just going to run it off a 4GB USB stick to start with but the 40GB mSATA came in a bundle so went with it.
[11:02] <hads> morning
[11:06] <olly> morning
[19:27] <ibeardslee> morning
[19:32] <ajmitch> morning
[19:50] <mwhudson> morning
[19:53] <olly> morning
[19:53] <mwhudson> olly, ojwb: did you find a cloning machine?
[20:15] <thumper> morning
[20:16] <olly> mwhudson: sadly not
[20:17] <olly> this one is in screen on a colo box - my laptop disk seems to have scrambled itself...
[20:18] <olly> currently just taking a copy of the disk partition to a USB drive, which takes a while
[20:20] <olly> i should probably sort out an irc bouncer so I can use one account from multiple places
[21:17] <ibeardslee> ohh my odroid just arrived
[21:35] <hads> ibeardslee: Oh cool!
[21:44] <ibeardslee> didn't order the power supply (didn't want the US plug) so will need to track one down at some stage before I can play with it.
[21:53] <olly> just twist the pins with pliers!
[23:15] <hads> ibeardslee: What type of supply?
[23:33] <ibeardslee> 5v 2A some piddly tiny socket
[23:39] <ajmitch> so a bit more than USB would supply, pity
