[01:57] <FloatingGoat> holstein: hello
[02:00] <FloatingGoat> my home boy
[02:08] <jambeedrum> asides from hydrogen and ardour, what other sorts of fun applications are there in music?
[02:14] <FloatingGoat> http://ubuntuone.com/1lq0vqiUeElP5G76IlrKG1
[02:14] <FloatingGoat> ^^lmms
[02:14] <len-1304> It depends on what you would like to do...
[02:15] <FloatingGoat> len-1304: lol check out my new jam
[02:16] <FloatingGoat> brb
[02:16] <len-1304> Which app did you use? Is that lmms?
[02:19] <jambeedrum> len-1304: with ardour i do recoding, and with hydogen i get a drummachine
[02:19] <jambeedrum> theyr ok
[02:19] <len-1304> qtractor allows midi or sample recording... if that is what you do.
[02:20] <jambeedrum> dont some apps got the picture and buttons of real hardware machines
[02:20] <len-1304> there are soft synths, effects. DJ/VJ set ups
[02:20] <jambeedrum> used for music?
[02:22] <len-1304> I am not sure what you mean. The mixer in ardour has faders, and controls as a normal mixer.
[02:22] <len-1304> I'm not sure seeing tape reals move would help much
[02:22] <len-1304> Harrison Mixbus may be closer though
[02:24] <len-1304> I once had an end to end analog setup (OK still have the stuff but can't afford the tape to get lower quality sound than the computer) and what I can do on the computer doesn't make sense to look at quite like the analog counter part
[02:25] <jambeedrum> len-1304: you never had the need to buy cubase?
[02:25] <len-1304> Never used windows
[02:25] <len-1304> (except at work)
[02:26] <len-1304> I am not sure why I would "need" cubase though.
[02:27] <len-1304> I can record 10 (or 100 or whatever) tracks and mix them down with EQ, effects and whatever.
[02:28] <len-1304>  I can sync qtractor or rosegarden and have a midi based set of tracks that can be mixed in as well.
[02:28] <len-1304> What is the big thing cubase has (aside from the name) that I "have" to have it?
[02:43] <len-1304> jambeedrum, what has to be there before anything else is the music or talent. There is great music that was recorded straight to vinyl or tape (single track) that still sounds exceptional today. It started out as music before the mic is all.
[02:44] <FloatingGoat> len-1304: did you listen
[02:44] <len-1304> FloatingGoat, you mean the short clip above?
[02:45] <len-1304> Was that lmms or qtractor?
[02:45] <FloatingGoat> lmms
[02:45] <FloatingGoat> :)
[02:45] <len-1304> How did you record the audio?
[02:45] <len-1304> (vocals)
[02:45] <FloatingGoat> sound recorder
[02:46] <len-1304> Thats what its called?
[02:47] <studio-user294> hi
[02:47] <len-1304> Hello
[02:48] <len-1304> FloatingGoat, what sample rate did you use... and what format did you upload?
[02:48] <FloatingGoat> ogg
[02:48] <FloatingGoat> idk
[02:48] <FloatingGoat> i converted it from 4800 wav
[02:48] <len-1304> Ok system default is 44.1k
[02:48] <len-1304> ok
[02:48] <FloatingGoat> ok
[02:49] <len-1304> I'm just doing some testing here
[02:49] <FloatingGoat> oh alright
[02:49] <len-1304> So I was seeing how much work my system has to do to play it
[02:51] <len-1304> It sounds like a good balanced collection of sounds.
[02:51] <len-1304> The vocal levels are good too.
[02:54] <FloatingGoat> yay!
[02:55] <FloatingGoat> wait are you len-td?
[02:55] <len-1304> -dt? ya, I am testing 13.04
[02:56] <len-1304> Speaking of which LMMS does now come on the ISO
[03:00] <FloatingGoat> haha awesome
[03:18] <FloatingGoat> len-1304: thanks for giving it a lsiten
[03:28] <len-1304> no problem.

[20:13] <Paul92_> hi. can you recomand me a good piano vsti?
[20:15] <zequence> Paul92_: Don't think a lot of people here do vst instruments. You doing that on Ubuntu?
[20:17] <Paul92_> zequence: well..actually on archlinux. but here is the only channel where I can find help on this topic, and i can manage to get things work on archlinux. With some help here, I managed to make hexter work, but it doesen't sond too good
[20:19] <zequence> Paul92_: hexter is a very simple synth clone
[20:20] <Paul92_> it's good but..i wish something that sounds better
[20:20] <zequence> zequence: I think I've talked to you before. The best I know, though haven't used much, is linux-sampler
[20:20] <zequence> There are a couple of piano sample libraries for that
[20:20] <zequence> On their site, but also the salamander library
[20:21] <zequence> The guy who made that hangs out at #opensourcemusicians
[20:21] <Paul92_> ok. I will try there also. thank you
[20:22] <zequence> Paul92_: linux sampler usually needs to be built from source. kxstudio has it in their repo, and from what I understand, falktx keeps a repo for Arch
[20:24] <Paul92_> that isn't a problem :)
[20:28] <Paul92_> so, I need to install linuxsampler, and after that qsampler, right?
[20:29] <zequence> Paul92_: There are two front ends for linux-sampler. qsampler and jsampler
[20:29] <zequence> linux sampler is the server
[20:29] <Paul92_> and I have to choose between qsampler and jsampler?
[20:30] <zequence> Usually, you can get all the other stuff, dependencies and front ends as packages, but you need to build the server separately
[20:30] <zequence> Yeah, you can only use one at the time
[20:30] <zequence> qsampler is based on QT, while jsampler I guess is Java based
[20:36] <Paul92_> I have some errors at make
[20:46] <zequence> Paul92_: I remember having some problem last time I was building it. Sure you have all the right dependencies?
[20:46] <zequence> Otherwise, a simpler approach might be just to add the prebuilt package by falktx
[20:47] <zequence> You can find him on many channels. #kxstudio, among others
[20:48] <Paul92_> ok. I will see what i can do. If i don't succed, I will ask somewere for further help
[20:48] <Paul92_> thank you very much
[21:52] <LaRueGT> good afternoon
[22:29] <LaRueGT> I'm looking for a composing aid of sorts. I'd like to be able to sing a tune into my mike, have the computer process it, and give me a MIDI stream that corresponds to the notes I just sang. That way I don't have to struggle with keyboarding them all down and forgetting them. Is there s smooth way of doing that floating around somewhere?
[22:35] <zequence> LaRueGT: You'd like to record your voice and turn it into a midi file?
[22:36] <zequence> There might be some pitch detector available. But, I'm not at all sure how automatic that process could be
[22:38] <zequence> What you need is something that can output midi
[22:39] <LaRueGT> well I have a keyboard but im not good enough at it to get the tunes out of my head before I forget them
[22:40] <LaRueGT> so yeah, Id like a software that recognizes the notes of my voice
[22:46] <zequence> LaRueGT: Hang on. I'm sending you a pure data patch. A very simple one that detects pitch, and sends midi out. If you connect it properly with jack and alsa midi, you can record your voice in both audio and midi
[22:51] <LaRueGT> sweet
[22:53] <LaRueGT> im on a web client on my tablet so you probably wont be able to dcc it
[22:54] <zequence> LaRueGT: No. You'll need puredata, and most probably installed in a PC
[22:56] <LaRueGT> oh yeah, my linux box upstairs has all that on it
[22:56] <zequence> LaRueGT: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12809728/pd_audio_to_midi.pd
[22:56] <zequence> LaRueGT: install puredata. open the file with it, and read the instructions
[22:57] <LaRueGT> did you just make this for me or get it off google somewhere?
[22:57] <zequence> I just made it
[22:57] <zequence> But, I'm also interested in doing something with that later myself
[22:57] <zequence> Pretty basic
[22:57] <zequence> But it works pretty well
[22:57] <zequence> If you want to hear the notes live, you'll need low latency
[22:58] <zequence> Both jack and pd need to be set up for that
[22:59] <zequence> pd might give you problems, if you try to adjust to lower latency while jack is running. So, might be best to run it from a terminal: pd -jack -alsamidi -audiobug 10
[22:59] <zequence> And start jack with something like 64 or 128 frames/period
[23:00] <zequence> hmm, I forgot one thing
[23:00] <zequence> No noteoff..
[23:00] <zequence> Let me fix that
[23:01] <LaRueGT> I wouldn't have thought a solution could just be whipped up so quick, its impressive
[23:02] <zequence> puredata is impressive in that respect
[23:02] <zequence> But, it takes a while to get used to it
[23:03] <zequence> I updated the file https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12809728/pd_audio_to_midi.pd
[23:03] <zequence> Now every time there's a new note, the previous note gets a noteoff
[23:04] <zequence> Actually, it would not be too much trouble to add velocity controlled noteoff too. Let me do that
[23:06] <LaRueGT> sounds like this pd stuff is worth studying
[23:11] <zequence> LaRueGT: All right. It's done. enjoy :)
[23:11] <zequence> It detects the pitch of any audio source, and sends midi notes with 100 velocity.
[23:11] <zequence> When the audio signal goes below a threshold of 30 RMS, the a noteoff is sent
[23:12] <zequence> Also, every new note is prepended with a noteoff of the previous note
[23:12] <LaRueGT> lovely
[23:13] <LaRueGT> all im really doin is like "doo - dooo - seeeeeee-" of some notes into my mike so I dont need a whole lot of sophistication, it might be cool to have that yield volume controls and pitch bends in the future mebbe
[23:19] <LaRueGT> im just really bad at knowing what note is in my head and trying to get it out of there, I know what it sounds like but not how to play it most of the time
[23:19] <zequence> LaRueGT: In case you downloaded it, I redid it again. There were a couple of bugs. Should work fine now
[23:20] <zequence> LaRueGT: That actually is in my view one of the most important parts of learning how to make music
[23:20] <zequence> The faster and easier you can produce your ideas, the more fluid the music will be
[23:21] <LaRueGT> well im not above using a computer to help me with it, perhaps with this thing recognizing my voice, I'll get familiar with them better the more I use it
[23:21] <zequence> LaRueGT: I'd do some interval excercises, if I were you. It really helps
[23:21] <LaRueGT> id imagine those are set up in some nice way on the web somewhere these days
[23:22] <zequence> Don't know. There was practically no internet when I started out
[23:22] <zequence> So, I did it the old school way
[23:22] <LaRueGT> I used to be alright at finding the tunes on my cello when I was little, that was years and years ago
[23:22] <LaRueGT> could sorta feel where on the string the tone was that I was looking for
[23:23] <LaRueGT> but its hard to get that feeling back on a computer
[23:23] <zequence> You can either try singin two notes, any interval, and trying to figure out what they are on an instrument. Then try it out. The slower, and the more focused, the better. Or listen to recorded intervals, and trying to figure out what they are.
[23:24] <zequence> Just 15 min of practice already makes a difference, especially if you aren't used to it
[23:25] <zequence> I used to write music using the keyboard roll on Cubase. No need to listen to the notes almost.
[23:25] <zequence> But, I don't ever anymore though
[23:26] <zequence> Singing sounds like a much better approach to me
