[17:57] <mh0> Hiya. I've had a application "In review" for about 2 weeks now, I was wondering what a ETA could be for such apps?
[18:02] <dpm> mh0, which app is it? Perhaps ajmitch or highvoltage can help?
[18:02] <mh0> It's named "Clock"
[18:14] <highvoltage> dpm: I could perhaps, I don't think I ahve arb rights back yet though (but should soon)
[18:16] <dpm> highvoltage, yeah, but I was thinking in terms of reviewing it, not uploading it
[18:16] <highvoltage> mh0: have a link for me?
[18:17] <highvoltage> the name already sounds like it could be a problem if it's that generic, but I'll check in the package name itself
[18:17] <mh0> https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/apps/2016/
[18:18] <highvoltage> mh0: ok, checking it now, it does seem like you'll have to change the name, though
[18:18] <mh0> Yeah, kinda thought that
[18:19] <mh0> I really should be more creative in terms of names.
[18:19] <highvoltage> mh0: thinking of good, original names for things is really hard
[18:19] <highvoltage> almost no one gets it right :)
[18:20] <mh0> Indeed
[18:21] <highvoltage> mh0: I ran the .deb I got in that zip file through lintian, it reported some problems worth addressing:
[18:21] <highvoltage> E: clock: arch-independent-package-contains-binary-or-object opt/Clock/libffmpegsumo.so
[18:21] <highvoltage> so "all" should probably be changed to "any" in the debian control file
[18:21] <mh0> Right, okies
[18:21] <mh0> Then re-upload?
[18:22] <highvoltage> yep
[18:22] <highvoltage> it's complaining about some spelling mistakes too. that's minor, but I suggest you run lintian too and then fix those for what it's worth
[18:22] <highvoltage> mh0: does the clock play videos or something?
[18:23] <highvoltage> mh0: there are embedded video codecs in there :)
[18:23] <mh0> Hm, I'm sure its needed for node-webkit
[18:23] <highvoltage> if it does indeed need them, then you need to depend on the codecs already in the archives and remove them from your package
[18:24] <highvoltage> eek, it also contains openssl, zlib, libjpeg, libxml2, libpng, sqlite...
[18:24] <highvoltage> you'll have to remove all of those and use the libraries already provided by Ubuntu
[18:25] <highvoltage> mh0: ok, so running lintian on your package and working through the report it gives you will pretty much give you a lot of things worth fixing already
[18:25] <mh0> Hm, I'll check more on how to package node-webkit apps for ubuntu
[18:25] <mh0> if you could then put all of the fixes back to me I can have a look at them
[18:30] <highvoltage> mh0: I'm afraid you'll have to fix them
[18:30] <mh0> Yep, I understand that
