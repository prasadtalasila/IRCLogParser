[05:25] <coolbhavi> hi ajmitch
[05:26] <coolbhavi> hi wendar happy that you are applying for MOTU :-)
[05:27] <cwayne> heya coolbhavi
[05:27] <coolbhavi> and we are thinking of extending the call for members for a bit longer
[05:27] <coolbhavi> hey cwayne :-)
[05:28] <cwayne> coolbhavi: how qualified does one need to be to be an arb member?
[05:30] <coolbhavi> cwayne, generally a ubuntu developer and an endorsement by an existing ubuntu developer on your work
[05:30] <cwayne> ah, not sure id be qualified to apply then :)
[05:35] <wendar> coolbhavi: thanks
[05:35] <wendar> coolbhavi: and it does seem worth getting highvoltage on now
[05:36] <wendar> coolbhavi: you can always make another recruiting call later
[05:36] <wendar> coolbhavi: like, maybe around the next UDS would be good
[05:37] <coolbhavi> wendar, yes we are really short of staff and we thought maybe extending the call for a week would help but the other way is people are busy :-)
[05:38] <wendar> coolbhavi: ah yeah
[05:40] <coolbhavi> just had a talk with alessio he also wants extension for a week so that anyone else interested might apply but I dont think it will be the case
[05:41] <coolbhavi> atleast looking at the response
[05:41] <coolbhavi> cwayne, you ll be if you have PPU rights for a package :-)
[05:44] <coolbhavi> wendar, btw I implemented all the remaining arb checks into lintian
[05:45] <wendar> coolbhavi: great!
[05:45] <coolbhavi> its in the ARB contributors PPA now
[05:45] <wendar> coolbhavi: I saw https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/app-review-board/2013-January/002852.html
[05:45] <coolbhavi> :)
[05:46] <wendar> coolbhavi: haven't had a chance to try it out yet
[05:47] <coolbhavi> wendar, no problems :-) feedback at any point is accepted :-) was thinking of UDS to discuss this because face to face feedback works much better I think :-)
[05:48] <coolbhavi> btw ll have a look at apparmor this weekend and start generating some profiles if time permits...
[05:54] <ajmitch> coolbhavi: hi
[05:54] <coolbhavi> ajmitch, pm?
[05:54]  * ajmitch doesn't mind extending by a week if you think it'll get anyone else
[05:54] <ajmitch> sure
