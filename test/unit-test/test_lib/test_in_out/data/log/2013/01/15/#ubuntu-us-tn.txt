[00:57] <average_guy> does pianobar work for anyone?
[00:58] <Unit193> For me, but I compiled it. :P
[00:58] <Unit193> Or, put it in a PPA.
[00:58] <average_guy> ?
[00:58] <average_guy> there is a ppa?
[00:59] <Unit193> Not an official one that I've seen, nope.
[01:01] <wrst> compiling seems to be the best average_guy  or run arch ;)
[01:02] <average_guy> i gunna figure out how to compile it tonight Unit193.
[01:02] <Unit193> average_guy: Yeah, pretty easy.
[01:04] <wrst> average_guy: there is a good you tube video for Debian
[01:04] <wrst> but the readme is about enough
[01:04] <wrst> or install I guess it is :)
[05:25] <average_guy> got pianobar working now
[05:25] <average_guy> I'm on a roll today
[05:44] <Unit193> Great job!
[05:46] <Unit193> I have a couple modifications, myself.
[06:03] <average_guy> modifications Unit193?
[06:05] <Unit193> Meh, couple small changes.
[06:06] <Unit193> As you can see, just some smaller handy things.
[06:06] <Unit193> Also have a patch that shows the station ID in the station select dialog.
[06:07] <average_guy> thats pretty cool
[06:09] <average_guy> that is the next step for me now that I have mutt, irssi, cmus, etc. I lookin at all the ways to trick em out
[06:10] <average_guy> much option
[13:42] <wrst> average_guy: will you ever use a mouse again?
[15:46] <average_guy> prolly not on this machine wrst
[15:48] <wrst> as long as you are happy average_guy :)
[15:48] <wrst> with the "power" it has that's really the best use for it
[15:50] <average_guy> I am thrilled with it wrst.  I grew up runnin DOS on a tricked out PCjr.  This is WAY better then that.
[15:50] <wrst> oh goodness yes
[15:51] <wrst> it really is amazing what you can do with the cli if you want to also
[15:51] <wrst> vlc works pretty nicely via the cli
[15:51] <wrst> i am assuming that videos are out of the question i think cyberanger had them playing in ascii or something silly like that once :)
[15:52] <average_guy> While technology
[15:52] <average_guy> opps
[15:53] <average_guy> really? you can play videos without windowing
[15:54] <wrst> average_guy: i really don't know
[15:54] <wrst> can't remember if he was pulling my leg or not :)
[15:54] <wrst> i mean you can't see video of course but i'm not for sure what he was doing
[15:54] <wrst> i'm assuming you could play the video with vlc and get just the audio feed pretty easily
[15:57] <average_guy> I did see something in my googling about cli video, of course, that would definately give my computer a heart attack
[15:58] <average_guy> I have other, more graphical machines I ssh in from
[15:59] <wrst> i would hope so average_guy :)
[16:01] <average_guy> I'm also trying to figure out virtualization for another project
[16:02] <average_guy> the goal of moving all of the core services to this old box was to make it so that I don't have to run the servers ALL the time
[16:03] <average_guy> my apartment is small and they were giving me a headache
[16:04] <average_guy> but I want a SAN
[16:22] <cyberanger> wrst: I've used ascii more for comedic effect, but framebuffer is also an option
[16:22] <cyberanger> and a more serious one
[16:23] <wrst> cyberanger: i thought you had something working in that regard... I should have known :)
[16:23] <wrst> and good morning cyberanger
[16:24]  * cyberanger looks at the time, morning indeed
[16:24] <cyberanger> yeah, --vout fb
[16:25] <cyberanger> there maybe more switches involved, been awhile
[16:25] <wrst> i'll take your word for it... I have a nice gui with vlc :)
[16:25] <wrst> well at least a gui don't know how nice
[16:25] <cyberanger> now, ascii is the default without xdisplay set
[16:25] <cyberanger> --vout none for audio only
[16:26] <cyberanger> wrst: the framebuffer is exceptional, real video, just not via xorg
[16:26] <wrst> cyberanger: and you can see it in a terminal?
[16:27] <cyberanger> wish I could see more of jelico, tn
[16:27] <cyberanger> so much fog, the driving is fine, but a pain
[16:27] <cyberanger> wrst: yes, but admittingly, still one thing worth xorg to me
[16:28] <wrst> wow i need to try that for laughs if nothing else
[16:28] <wrst> cyberanger: be careful its extremely foggy here
[16:28] <cyberanger> just due to the fact I rarely watch just one video
[16:28] <cyberanger> wrst: can you see more than 300 ft?
[16:29] <wrst> can now could see about 0 feet to start the day
[16:29] <wrst> well probably about 50 feet or so
[16:29] <wrst> was pretty rough
[16:29] <wrst> it was THICK and also rain to boot
[16:29] <cyberanger> yeah, that's my current issue still
[16:29] <wrst> monterey always has some fog issues
[16:29] <wrst> ouch
[16:29] <cyberanger> hence my early stop for lunch
[16:30] <cyberanger> going to hope KY & OH are better
[16:31] <average_guy> be careful cyberanger
[16:32] <cyberanger> average_guy: I intend to be, I treat my truck better than my computers
[16:32] <wrst> :)
[16:32] <cyberanger> and I treat rentals better than my truck
[16:33] <cyberanger> since I can't fix those issues as easily as a reinstall of the OS
[16:33] <average_guy> I wish...
[16:34] <elijah-mbp> reinstall engine 2.0..
[16:34] <average_guy> upgrading to dual-core
[16:35] <wrst> howdy elijah-mbp, how's it going?
[16:36] <elijah-mbp> tired but good i guess
[16:36] <elijah-mbp> trying to hire staff / find bodies.
[16:37] <wrst> elijah-mbp: i would think you should be able to find people but i guess by bodies you mean warm ones ?
[16:37] <wrst> :)
[16:37] <cyberanger> engine 2.0 depends on premium-fuel, but premium-fuel is not going to be installed
[16:38] <cyberanger> premium-fuel has unmet dependencies
[16:38] <cyberanger> premium-fuel depends on money, but money is not installable
[16:39] <average_guy> sudo install premium-fuel!
[16:39] <average_guy> -f
[16:39] <wrst> average_guy: i don't think premium-fuel is an opensource software offering i think its proprietary
[16:39] <elijah-mbp> well, senior operations folks are kind of hard to come by
[16:40] <cyberanger> elijah-mbp: depends on the requirements too
[16:41] <elijah-mbp> pretty high.  we don't really need juniors, we need people we can sort of plug in and they get started, asking questions when they get stuck.  :-)
[16:41] <cyberanger> and it's funny how with the unemployment issues that keps happening
[16:41] <wrst> elijah-mbp: oh well you aren't just needing people then :)
[16:41] <elijah-mbp> nope, need super-SA types
[16:42] <cyberanger> well, super-SA, that's not me, dedicated, awesome, but not super
[16:42] <elijah-mbp> have to fit with a bunch of system engineers and devs with 20 years of experience.
[16:42] <cyberanger> ;-)
[16:42]  * wrst is a bean counter he is on a different planet
[16:43] <elijah-mbp> accounting!!!
[16:43] <elijah-mbp> that is space alien land to most people
[16:43] <average_guy> I am trying to learn right now, in the hope of picking up one of those jobs eventually.
[16:43] <elijah-mbp> :)
[16:45] <cyberanger> also, not sure if I've earned the use of the word senior
[16:46] <cyberanger> but, I've found few who like that word
[16:46]  * cyberanger hits the road again, bbl
[16:46] <elijah-mbp> it makes me feel creaky.  at 35.  :p
[17:05] <wrst> elijah-mbp: you aren't craeky until 40
[17:05] <wrst> you have five years, enjoy :)
[17:20] <average_guy> thank a lot wrst, I almost there
[17:21]  * average_guy is 37 and feelin REALLY old now
[17:22] <wrst> i'm just 3 years behind average_guy
[19:47] <wrst> hello RagnarokAngel
[19:53] <RagnarokAngel> what's up?
[19:53] <RagnarokAngel> When did gwibber become such a heaping mess of bad software?
[19:53] <wrst> not much RagnarokAngel
[19:54] <wrst> and to be honest i was wondering when it ever became good :)
[19:54] <RagnarokAngel> It was good before the UI overhaul
[19:54] <RagnarokAngel> I should just find a .8 version somewhere.
[19:54] <RagnarokAngel> It won't even scroll correctly.
[19:55] <wrst> I could never get into it, of course i also tried it on arch and i think its more an ubuntu thing
[19:55] <RagnarokAngel> originally it was just a gtk thing
[19:55] <RagnarokAngel> I have a feeling segphault isn't managing it anymore.
[19:55] <wrst> yeah i tried it in gnome shell it was just irritating to me
[19:55] <RagnarokAngel> yeah that's what I'm running it in
[19:55] <RagnarokAngel> it's broken.
[19:55] <wrst> since gnome-shell kept breaking extensions with every point update i moved to kde and wouldn't even attempt it there
[19:59] <RagnarokAngel> I really like the shell
[19:59] <RagnarokAngel> It still feels like gnome
[20:02] <RagnarokAngel> ugh I don't want to build the old version from source.
[20:11] <wrst> maybe an old .deb out there somewhere that wont' cause some dependency issues?
