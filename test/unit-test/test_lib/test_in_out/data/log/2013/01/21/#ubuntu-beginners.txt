[09:10] <yeehi> How do I view the contents of /root? I need permissions
[10:44] <yeehi> some programs are installed. How do I start them automatically at start-up? eg conky redshift?
[11:33] <geirha> sudo ls /root
[11:34] <geirha> conky is a graphical, per-user program, so the right place to put that is in your Startup Applications
[11:34] <geirha> never heard of redshift
[12:24] <bear__> Hi everyone. I am having a problem with an external drive (500Gb)... when I check properties it says that it has about 250GB in contents (half full) but 499Gb "used" and less than a Gb Free... it's like when ever I have deleted something it has gotten rid of the files but not actually freed up the space
[13:42] <Russian> hey what's up guys i have some monitor and resolution problems, could someone possibly shed some light?
[13:53] <geirha> bear__: How do you delete something? It might have gone to trash
[13:54] <geirha> e.g. selecting a file in nautilus (the file browser) and hitting the Delete key on the keyboard will just move the file to trash
[13:54] <geirha> and the trash will be stored on the same filesystem as the file is on
[13:54] <geirha> a hidden directory named something like .Trash-1000
[15:17] <sorbanos> hi all
[15:18] <sorbanos> i have maybe silly question, but i'm wondering how can i reinstall nvidia graphics driver purely in CLI
[15:19] <sorbanos> can someone help me?
[15:25] <geirha> sorbanos: jockey-text is the command-line equivalent of "Additional Drivers"
[15:25] <geirha> jockey-text --help
[15:28] <sorbanos> ok thank you for help
[20:33] <raub> Shouldn't the reverse zone entry (in named.conf.local) for 172.16.101.64/27 look something like zone "64-27.101.16.172.in-addr.arpa" IN { [...] }; ?
