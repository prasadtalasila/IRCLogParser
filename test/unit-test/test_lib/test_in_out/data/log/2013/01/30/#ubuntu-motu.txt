[00:53] <TheLordOfTime> hmm...........
[00:53] <TheLordOfTime> anyone know which package provides python dev headers?
[01:01] <aboudreault> python2.7-dev ??
[01:02] <aboudreault> apt-cache search python | grep dev
[01:02] <TheLordOfTime> hmm
[01:02] <TheLordOfTime> that's weird because when i use that on this package, it errors out..
[01:03] <TheLordOfTime> unless debhelper's broken... https://launchpadlibrarian.net/129898603/buildlog_ubuntu-raring-amd64.mysql-workbench_5.2.45%2Bdfsg-1~raring~ppa0.1_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz
[01:03] <TheLordOfTime> python-all-dev caused an FTBFS because it couldn't find the dev headers... switching it out with python2.7-dev caused FTBFS too...
[01:07] <TheLordOfTime> strangely, though...
[01:07] <TheLordOfTime> using the upstream mysql-workbench package that you download from Oracle works OOTB
[01:07] <TheLordOfTime> except that you have to manually install it
=== Amaranthus is now known as Amaranth
=== jackyalcine_ is now known as jalcine
[03:08] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: hrm, python-all-dev should do it
[03:08] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, and it wasn't - case in point the earlier build log
[03:08] <TheLordOfTime> (and strangely enough: i just asked about this in -packaging xD
[03:08] <TheLordOfTime> )
[03:09] <TheLordOfTime> https://launchpad.net/~teward/+archive/buildtests/+build/4257686 i386; https://launchpad.net/~teward/+archive/buildtests/+build/4257685 amd64
[03:09] <TheLordOfTime> and those two build logs were using *only* the debian version with nothing changed but a changelog repointing to raring for the PPA
[03:09] <TheLordOfTime> i *tested* whether python2.7-dev was sufficient, and that FTBFS'd as well
[03:09] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: backportpackage is your friend :)
[03:10] <TheLordOfTime> which was that ~ppa0.1 one i linked after asking what the dev headers package is
[03:10] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, from Experimental?
[03:10] <TheLordOfTime> backportpackage can work from Experimental?
[03:10] <TheLordOfTime> o.O
[03:10] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, 5.2.45 is in experimental only...
[03:10] <TheLordOfTime> ... or oracle's binary-only .deb ...
[03:10] <micahg> it's in the python package, why does python-dev not depend on python :(
[03:10] <TheLordOfTime> (and oracle's 5.2.45 deb works fine)
[03:11] <TheLordOfTime> (at least in 12.04 it does)
[03:11] <TheLordOfTime> so i'm curious what the delta is between oracle's .debs and what's in Experimental
[03:11] <micahg> python-all-dev depends on python :(
[03:11] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, and now you know why i'm confuzled with this package
[03:12] <TheLordOfTime> in theory, it should build.
[03:12] <TheLordOfTime> in actuality it does not
[03:12] <micahg> http://wiki.debian.org/Python/TransitionToDHPython2?action=show&redirect=Python%2FPythonSupportToDHPython2
[03:12] <TheLordOfTime> ... well, it depwait'd initially, because of mysql-connector-c++ not being new enough in raring... that was an easy fix...
[03:13] <micahg> ah, hrm, let me update
[03:13] <TheLordOfTime> but i'm hesitant to ask that to be sync'd because its rdeps shows a libreoffice sql connection plugin as depending on it (which could break thingsa!)
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, if i do ask for a sync of mysql-workbench from experimental: (1) the FTBFS issue needs fixing, and (2) https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-connector-c++ needs to be updated (the package in it that holds the library shows an rdep of something in libreoffice)
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> unless i'm mistaken, if it FTBFS in a PPA, it FTBFS in the archives.
[03:16] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: yeah, you'll need to talk to sweetshark to see if libreoffice works with the newer version
[03:17] <TheLordOfTime> so, email then.
[03:17]  * TheLordOfTime goes and locates their LP page
[03:17] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, regardless, i want to nail down the FTBFS issue.
[03:17] <TheLordOfTime> whether i end up requesting the sync or not
[03:18] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: yeah, that seems fine
[03:18] <TheLordOfTime> and since i'm sufficiently confuzled about why it initially FTBFS, well...
[03:18] <TheLordOfTime> no clue how to resolve that since python-all-dev should pull in dev headers
[03:18] <TheLordOfTime> but the configure script won't detect them in ~ppa0
[03:19] <TheLordOfTime> so... unless python-all-dev in Ubuntu puts it in a different location than the configure script seeks...
[03:20] <TheLordOfTime> ... which afaict it shouldn't...
[03:21] <micahg> oh, that's probably a multiarch problem which I thought they were all fixed
[03:21] <micahg> err.mostly fixed
[03:23] <TheLordOfTime> so...
[03:23] <TheLordOfTime> blame launchpad and go complain to them?
[03:25] <micahg> no
[03:25] <ajmitch> what has launchpad got to do with a build failure like that?
[03:25]  * TheLordOfTime misread
[03:25]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[03:25] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, is there a solution to this?
[03:25] <micahg> you probably need to make the configure check use python-config
[03:28] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: I'll have a debdiff for you in a minute
[03:28] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, thanks.
[03:29] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: try this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587747/
[03:29] <TheLordOfTime> also, afaict, somewhere between what's in quantal and latest upstream (which is in experimental, albeit possibly tweaked), this bug might've been fixed: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-workbench/+bug/1108630
[03:29] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1108630 in mysql-workbench (Ubuntu) "mysql-workbench SQL Editor does not show any schemas" [Undecided,New]
[03:29] <TheLordOfTime> so if i can at least get this to build and see if the version from Debian Exp fixes this, that would be added to the sync reason
[03:33] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: actually, that's not the right fix..
[03:34] <micahg> that's the one that was fixed :)
[03:35] <TheLordOfTime> urgh, lag.
[03:37] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, confirmed: 5.2.45 has some codefix that resolves the issue, using the packages produced by Oracle
[03:38] <TheLordOfTime> (which fixes Bug #1108630 that is)
[03:38] <ubottu> bug 1108630 in mysql-workbench (Ubuntu) "mysql-workbench SQL Editor does not show any schemas" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1108630
[03:39] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: try this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587765/ , the patch will need a little explanation since what upstream was trying to do was broke to begin with
[03:39] <TheLordOfTime> of course, i'm waiting to hear back from sweetshark via email on whether libreoffice can build with the dependency on the mysql-connector-c++ 1.1.1
[03:39] <TheLordOfTime> before i file *any* sync requests.
[03:40] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: if libreoffice 4.0 builds with it, I'll take it for backports regardless
[03:41] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, this isn't backportable in its current form, not without... ah... "tweaking" to make it work
[03:41] <TheLordOfTime> for pre-raring
[03:41] <micahg> well, builds + works
[03:41] <TheLordOfTime> afaict at least
[03:41] <TheLordOfTime> (for raring, if the FTBFS is fixed, this can be synced :P)
[03:41] <TheLordOfTime> again, depending on the response from sweetshark
[03:43] <micahg> yeah, best to try to get it in the release itself first :)
[03:43] <TheLordOfTime> yep
[03:43] <TheLordOfTime> and of course i don't do that until i build-test :P
[03:46] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, suggested explanation?  since you wrote the patch :P
[03:46]  * TheLordOfTime put that in the AUthor: field in the DEP3
[03:47] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: Since the upstream configure file uses -L in the LIBS test, python-config --ldflags is the easiest way to get that
[03:47] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: and it goes in the description
[03:48] <TheLordOfTime> right
[03:48] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, your contact info's in Author: though if i remember dep3 right
[03:48] <micahg> well, that + the libs
[03:48] <micahg> yeah, should already be there
[03:48] <TheLordOfTime> yeah, it wouldnt quilt import right, so i am (sort of) rebuilding the dep3
[03:48] <TheLordOfTime> (apparently this line broke it: ---)
[03:49] <TheLordOfTime> i meant that i put that you were the author in Author:
[03:49] <TheLordOfTime> :p
[04:03] <TheLordOfTime> ... wow gmail detected the LP PPA notifications as spam o.O
[04:11] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, so far so good: https://launchpad.net/~teward/+archive/buildtests/+build/4258335
[04:12] <TheLordOfTime> no FTBFS... yet...
[04:14] <TheLordOfTime> (i386 is lagging behind the amd64 build though... by about two minutes)
[05:40] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, successfully built from source - your patch fixed the FTBFS.
[05:41] <TheLordOfTime> once i hear back from sweetshark, and assuming LibreOffice builds with the updated mysql-connector-c++ source, then you'll see at least one sync request (probably going to have to work with devel to get the cpp connector synced though, since its in main)
[05:42] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: I can take care of it, I'll keep an eye on the queu
[05:42] <TheLordOfTime> awesome, in the mean time i'll wait to hear back on the email i sent.  at least it doesn't fail to build now :P

[15:31] <TheLordOfTime> (although i don't think there'll be issues there ;P)

[15:32]  * TheLordOfTime goes back to stabbing a half-dead drive
[15:32] <TheLordOfTime> ESphynx, same difference, except i think MOTU has approve-nomination or equivalent rights - bugcontrol can nominate for a specific release (such as affects: quantal, lucid, etc.), but only a specific group can approve such things.
[15:32] <ESphynx> Ok thanks. I'll finally be assigning to ubuntu-sru
[15:33] <ESphynx> been working on this non-stop since Saturday :S
[15:33] <Laney> assigning to ubuntu-sru doesn't sond right
[15:33] <TheLordOfTime> ESphynx, you mean subscribe?
[15:33] <ESphynx> Laney: it doesn't?
[15:33] <ESphynx> subscribing, yes, sorry.
[15:33] <TheLordOfTime> ESphynx, subscribe them - don't assign.
[15:33] <ESphynx> yes subscribe is what I meant :P
[15:33] <Laney> subscribe *ubuntu-sponsors* to the bug which contains the patch/branch
[15:34] <ESphynx> Procedure #4 says  Ask a bug supervisor to target the bug to the appropriate Ubuntu releases (e. g. the current LTS and latest stable release), then subscribe the team ubuntu-sru to your bug report.
[15:34] <TheLordOfTime> ESphynx, you missed the part where you have to subscribe ubuntu-sponsors if you have no upload rights
[15:34] <Laney> Oh, it does say that but I believe that's obsolete
[15:35] <Laney> anyway, you can do it if you like but the important part that will get it uploaded is ubuntu-sponsros
[15:35] <Laney> with correct spelling
[15:35] <TheLordOfTime> Laney, if its obsolete, why's it still there?
[15:35]  * TheLordOfTime raises an eyebrow
[15:35] <Laney> because nobody deleted it yet?
[15:35] <Laney> it's not harmful but I do not think it is necessary any more
[15:35] <ESphynx> well I'm hoping my friends micahg and xnox are going to take it from here :P
[15:35] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[15:36] <TheLordOfTime> ... oh that reminds me, i have to go prod bugcontrol's mailing list about something...
[15:36] <TheLordOfTime> Laney, this whole talk of "obsolete things on the wiki" reminded me of things :P
[15:37] <Laney> at least with a wiki such things are easily fixable
[15:37] <TheLordOfTime> well...
[15:37] <TheLordOfTime> sorta...
[15:37] <TheLordOfTime> depending on who has "operational control" over the specific wiki areas
[15:37] <TheLordOfTime> like... bugcontrol has somewhat control over the Bugs/* stuff
[15:37] <TheLordOfTime> ... which reminds me yet AGAIN to send an email to bugcontrol list regarding something
