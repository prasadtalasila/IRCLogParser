[00:10] <philipballew> pleia2, are you?
[00:10] <philipballew> wondering who was doing the meeting tonight?
[00:11] <philipballew> I see no email so I might send one out
[03:03] <jtatum> I think pleia2 was going to run it.. but perhaps the travel derailed those plans
[03:04] <grantbow> yes, she texted me

[03:07] <darthrobot> Title: [CaliforniaTeam/Projects/Scale11x - Ubuntu Wiki]
[03:07] <philipballew> alright I have put in some work for scale and I would like to tell what work I have put into it, what the booth would look like, and how we can get people to help
[03:08] <philipballew> SO I have managed to get Pearson books to send me between 20-30 copies of the official ubuntu book to hand out
[03:09] <philipballew> I have contacted Sysmem 76 and they are going to bring a computer for us to have on the table so we do not have to use our own.
[03:10] <jtatum> nice!
[03:10] <philipballew> Also I am getting a conference pack sent to me soon from Canonical for the thing.
[03:10] <philipballew> Now we need booth volunteers.
[03:10] <Darkwing> Talk to Zareason, they sent me a laptop for Ohio Linux Fest, and I was only there for a half day.
[03:11] <philipballew> Darkwing, these places are usually really cool with that
[03:11]  * grantbow adds the wiki page to Projects
[03:11] <philipballew> at the bottom of the wiki is where you can out your name. put your name there and then email me so you can get a code to register.
[03:11] <philipballew> I should have the registration packet soon.
[03:12] <philipballew> were about 5 weeks out
[03:12] <philipballew> on the Wiki is a wiki for hotel share and ride share.
[03:13] <philipballew> hopefully someone can use these
[03:13] <grantbow> good work Philip :-)
[03:13] <eps> Airfares from the Bay Area are no bargain at the moment -- ~$192 (but the weekends are usually the worst times to be shopping for travel)
[03:13] <philipballew> Mege bus is nice
[03:13] <philipballew> *mega bus
[03:13] <philipballew> there about 25 each way last time Iooked
[03:14] <philipballew> *I looked
[03:14]  * Darkwing wishes he had $500 laying around to fly out
[03:14]  * grantbow too
[03:14] <philipballew> now I am not sure where these places stop and get off, however maybe someone from la can pick up these people if they need a ride.
[03:15] <philipballew> as LA is a big place
[03:16] <philipballew> currently working to make sure all booth workers have a few nice gifts to go home with as well.
[03:16] <philipballew> We do not pay, but we hand out free stuff.
[03:17] <eps> How many free T-shirts did you bring home last year? ;-)
[03:17] <philipballew> 29!
[03:18] <philipballew> southwest usually has good flight deals
[03:19] <philipballew> thats the best I have ever found
[03:19] <philipballew> eps, do you see yourself coming in Feb?
[03:20] <philipballew> currently I see 69 dollars there on sw and 69 back assuming you leave sf thursday and come back monday
[03:21] <eps> Probably. I prefer to fly, but Greyhound Express and Megabus are both viable possibilities. I like to minimize hotel stays, since they represent the major expense involved.

[03:22] <philipballew> Spirt airlines is good if you can travel light

[03:33] <grantbow> thanks for organizing
[03:34] <philipballew> not a problem. Glad to help.
[03:34] <grantbow> are there other names that should go on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/ ?
[03:34] <darthrobot> Title: [CaliforniaTeam/Projects - Ubuntu Wiki]
[03:34] <philipballew> not sure
[03:35] <grantbow> if you are the primary contact then I guess not
[03:35] <grantbow> there were three listed for last year

[03:40] <philipballew> pleia2, is the loco contact
[05:45] <philipballew> grantbow, around?
[06:13] <pleia2> thanks grantbow and philipballew
[06:14] <pleia2> philipballew: sorry for not getting the email out, was traveling all day so only managed to get the social media stuff out :(
[06:14] <philipballew> pleia2, not a problem
[06:15] <pleia2> should have sent it out yesterday
[06:18] <philipballew> For sure. I think we still had a good turnout, and the Scale booth has some good volunteers so far. I can shoot it out next time if you are not available to.
[06:19] <philipballew> or if you decide Seattle is too good to ever leave.
[06:20] <pleia2> haha
[06:20] <pleia2> it is pretty cool :)
[06:20] <pleia2> but I love SF
[06:21] <pleia2> and it's really cold here
[06:21] <pleia2> time for me to get some sleep, I'm beat
