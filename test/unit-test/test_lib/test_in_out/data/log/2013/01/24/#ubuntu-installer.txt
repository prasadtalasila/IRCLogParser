[17:37] <cjwatson> kentb: this bug is turning into a bit of a nightmare, isn't it - in all fairness I think I have to say that it's currently at risk for 12.04.2
[17:37] <cjwatson> kentb: (I'm on leave tomorrow, which doesn't help)
[17:38] <kentb> cjwatson,  ok. indeed it is.  I'll talk to Dell about when they expect to see these drives start selling and whether or not we need to come up with a plan B
[17:41] <cjwatson> kentb: Do you think it might be possible for me to get remote console access to a box matching the one you're using, somehow?
[17:41] <cjwatson> (And yeah, I realise I dropped the ball between October and now ...)
[17:42] <kentb> cjwatson, let me find out wrt to console access...would it help if we could (possibly) express ship a drive to you?
[17:47] <cjwatson> Difficult - I have very little study space and currently don't have a spare machine to put a drive in
[17:48] <cjwatson> We need to move house really, but I've been working too hard to prepare for it, so slightly chicken and egg :)
[17:48] <cjwatson> Maybe in the next place I should look at rack + KVM
[17:50] <infinity> Every time I move, my inner nerd says "I should totally make room for a 19" rack".  I never do.
[17:54] <ogra_> mak room, i have a spare one to give away !
[17:54] <ogra_> *make
[17:57] <kentb> cjwatson, we're looking into console access but it may not be in enough time for you (we need to do that, anyway for the future).
[18:03]  * kentb heads to lunch
[20:53] <danjared> cjwatson: are you still looking to see if you can get remote access?
[21:03] <danjared> kentb: Custom Solutions would be able to provide remote access. I just need to patch some cables.
[21:10] <kentb> danjared, ok. cool.

[23:15] <cjwatson> danjared: That'd be fantastic, thanks.  Due to holiday I won't be able to make use of it until Monday, but if it's available by then I can get right on it.
