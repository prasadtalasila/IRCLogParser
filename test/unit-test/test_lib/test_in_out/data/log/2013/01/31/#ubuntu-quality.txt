[00:00] <xnox> (for example have 2GB thumb drive and 100GB disk & choose to install onto 2GB thumb drive using manual partitioning)
[00:02] <TheLordOfTime> xnox:  and what about using the liveusb environment (no persistence) to install to a bare 750GB drive?
[00:02] <xnox> no, that should be fine.
[00:03] <TheLordOfTime> that's where i ran into the issue - it crashed/errored, and apport stated its LP Bug 220961
[00:03] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 220961 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "[MASTER] ubiquity crashes instead of notifying the user of not enough disk space" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/220961
[00:03] <TheLordOfTime> in the 12.04.1 LTS ISO on the liveusb
[00:03] <TheLordOfTime> now, one of two things could have caused this:
[00:04] <TheLordOfTime> (1) my partitioning scheme was wrong (unlikely - it lets you know if you're doing something stupid), or
[00:04] <TheLordOfTime> (2) having selected "update software during installation" caused the issue
[00:04] <TheLordOfTime> and since it got to "Installing System..." i'm pretty certain (1) was not the issue
[00:05] <TheLordOfTime> note that when i reran the installer i didn't choose "update software during installing" or whatever the option is and it didn't error
[00:06] <balloons> back later guys
[00:06] <TheLordOfTime> xnox:  so unless apport is completely wrong, and its a much more major bug in ubiquity, the ISO should be rechecked
[00:06] <TheLordOfTime> or, ubiquity's functionality for updating during installation checked, at least
[00:07] <xnox> TheLordOfTime: i'd like to see logs of it triggered with "update software during installation" checked.
[00:08] <TheLordOfTime> xnox:  good luck to you - i didn't have apport keep em because apport said it would have my password data
[00:08] <TheLordOfTime> and i'm not risking the now-working installation to retest
[00:08] <xnox> TheLordOfTime: and that's a lie, unless you booted with "debug-ubiquity"
[00:08] <TheLordOfTime> xnox:  then apport needs to be shot
[00:08] <xnox> TheLordOfTime: it's just we don't check if we have booted into 'debug-ubiquity' mode or not.
[00:08] <TheLordOfTime> and retooled.
[00:09] <xnox> TheLordOfTime: well, not apports fault, but the ubiquity hook in apport.....
[00:09] <TheLordOfTime> xnox:  given i'm not on the live usb anymore, do those logs even exist?
[00:09] <xnox> TheLordOfTime: the real fix is to fix debian-installer not to print passwords in the logs.

[20:31] <Noskcaj> phillw, do you know if the "recurive" PPC bug affects the latest builds of 12.04.2?
[20:54] <phillw> Noskcaj: lubuntu don't have a LTS, so no 12.04.1 or 12.04.2
[20:54] <Noskcaj> i'm meaning netboot too
[20:56] <Noskcaj> just realised netboot ppc doesn't have a testcase http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/204/builds

[21:00] <Noskcaj> i think so, i just need someone else to confirm

[21:43] <letozaf_> balloons, I saw you ran the autopilot evince test
[21:43] <letozaf_> balloons, I get an error
[21:43] <letozaf_> balloons, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1594392
[21:43] <balloons> letozaf_, yes, it does work for me
[21:44] <letozaf_> balloons, what did I do wrong ?
[21:44] <letozaf_> balloons, I launched : autopilot run -v -r -f xml -o autopilot-evince.xml evince
[21:44] <balloons> ohh ouch
[21:44] <balloons> it just failed
[21:45] <letozaf_> balloons, :(
[21:45] <balloons> did you install the package from the ppa
[21:45] <balloons> did it install clean?
[21:45] <letozaf_> balloons, yes I followed the instructions and it installed clean
[21:45] <letozaf_> balloons, non errors
[21:45] <letozaf_> balloons, could it be I have the old versions
[21:45] <letozaf_> balloons, I mean I had run the
[21:46] <letozaf_> balloons, unity tests time ago
[21:46] <balloons> letozaf_, blame the packager :-)
[21:46] <balloons> which is me
[21:46] <letozaf_> balloons, :D
[21:46] <letozaf_> balloons, but you ran the test
[21:46] <letozaf_> balloons, and it workde
[21:47] <letozaf_> balloons, worked
[21:52] <balloons> weird
[21:52] <letozaf_> balloons, :(
[21:52] <balloons> it's still my fault don't worry
[21:52] <balloons> but we'll get it fixed and push up a new one
[21:54] <letozaf_> balloons, ok, thanks! thought I did something wrong as it worked for you
=== salem_ is now known as _salem
[21:57] <balloons> bah apt-file doesn't work with ppa's
[21:57] <balloons> sadface
[21:59] <balloons> letozaf_, lol
[21:59] <balloons> autopilot list ubuntu_autopilot_tests
[21:59] <balloons> I'm guessing you see good stuff then right?
[22:00] <letozaf_> balloons, yes
[22:00] <balloons> d'oh
[22:00] <letozaf_> balloons, 28 total tests
[22:00] <balloons> autopilot run ubuntu_autopilot_tests.evince
[22:00] <balloons> so in full
[22:00] <balloons> autopilot run -v -r -f xml -o autopilot-evince.xml ubuntu_autopilot_tests.evince
[22:00] <balloons> my bad
[22:00] <balloons> i thought something was wrong
[22:00] <letozaf_> balloons, autopilot run ubuntu_autopilot_tests.evince is working
[22:01] <balloons> lol, yes
[22:01] <letozaf_> balloons, as soon as it finishes I will launch autopilot run -v -r -f xml -o autopilot-evince.xml ubuntu_autopilot_tests.evince
[22:05] <letozaf_> balloons, :( no autopilot run -v -r -f xml -o autopilot-evince.xml ubuntu_autopilot_tests.evince   does not work
[22:05] <letozaf_> balloons, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1594561
[22:06] <balloons> ohh that's simple
[22:06] <balloons> you need to run from a writable directory
[22:06] <balloons> your in /usr/bin and trying to write out a xml file
[22:06] <letozaf_> balloons, you are right!
[22:06] <balloons> you can fix it by specifying the output file better
[22:06] <balloons> maybe I should make the directions push it to the home dir?
[22:06] <balloons> I'll update all of them like that
[22:06] <letozaf_> balloons, ok
[22:07] <letozaf_> balloons, it worked... in the right directory :D
[22:08] <letozaf_> balloons, what about the xml file ?
[22:08] <balloons> ok, if everything worked, we don't need it :-)
[22:09] <letozaf_> balloons, if something fails... where do we put it ?
[22:09] <letozaf_> balloons, not that I want it to fail :-b
[22:10] <balloons> ahh.. yes, attach it to the bug report
[22:10] <balloons> it will help us understand how the test failed
[22:11] <letozaf_> balloons, it succeeded :D
[22:11] <letozaf_> balloons, but now I know what to do with the xml file in case the other tests fail :-b
[22:12] <tgm4883> Noskcaj, i think i wrote those mythbuntu testcases and got balloons approval
[22:12] <tgm4883> it was awhile ago
[22:30] <balloons> ohh carla is gone
[22:30] <balloons> well, the instructions are fixed
[22:30] <balloons> tgm4883, let me look.
[22:32] <balloons> tgm4883, ahh.. no big deal, just a style change the tests went through
[22:32] <balloons> we moved to <dl> and <dt> tags
[22:32] <balloons> instead of <ol> and <ul>
[22:34] <phillw> tgm4883: don't worry, balloons has handy little script to transfer them... He is just too shy to say :)
[22:34] <balloons> ^^ yes, I'll fix them up for you
[22:34] <balloons> they'll be the same, just prettier ;-)
[22:35] <phillw> and, tgm4883 don't feel bad... i gave a classroom session recently using the wrong tags... It's still on my TODO list to get it corrected :/
[22:38] <alesage> balloons can you direct me to any autopilot tests you may have written for gedit?
[22:39] <balloons> alesage, everything (most) is in trunk
[22:39] <balloons> a non-intro example, hacks on intro stuff, and then the example I did for the the wlkathrough
[22:39] <balloons> I have to actually merge those into the real test sometime
[22:39] <alesage> ok thx balloons
[22:40] <balloons> you need links, or?
[22:45] <alesage> o sorry balloons no I'm fine :) , noticing that you stopped around where I'm stopping, i.e. detecting if text is highlighted, syntax coloring, etc.
