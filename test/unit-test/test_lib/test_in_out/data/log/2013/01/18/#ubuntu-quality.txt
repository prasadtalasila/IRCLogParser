[20:45] <Ade> Minor issue: How is the best way to suggest a more specific wording of a testcase... or even better go in an submit a change in it?
[20:47] <balloons> Ade, a manual case?
[20:48] <balloons> report it as a bug, or ping here or mailing list.. there's a team of folks who can edit the cases
=== salem_ is now known as _salem
[20:53] <Ade> balloons, yes a manual. So minor tho, more descriptive than anything but it's buggin me lol. Ok will do :o)
[20:58] <Ade> balloons, hows the autopilot going? Am still cutting teeth here in manual but feel there is so much that could be auto that it's only a matter of time before I join you there
[20:58] <Ade> balloons, with suggestions of course :o)
=== _salem is now known as salem_
[20:58] <balloons> ade, :-)
[20:58] <balloons> it's going well. I'm fingers crossed, going to push out a new blog post soon
[20:58] <balloons> I'm just tweaking a few things and making sure everything is the way we want it to be
[20:59] <balloons> sadly, I never figured out what happened to the ppa package
[20:59] <balloons> I want some folks to try the tests we've written
[21:00] <Ade> balloons, blog post now! Any info is good info :o)
[21:01] <Ade> balloons, win the battle, but perhaps the war tomorrow, sometimes these things happen.
[21:01] <Ade> balloons, am all ears tho if you're looking for folks to try the new...
[21:02] <balloons> Ade, you can run them withouth the package, but you have to pull them from bz
[21:02] <balloons> *bzr
[21:02] <balloons> perhaps I'll just post about doing that.. hmm
[21:03] <balloons> i posted on the mailing list about it, but a blog post would work too
[21:03] <Ade> **scrambles for Thunderbird!
[21:08] <balloons> Ade, if you need the info, the tests are here
[21:08] <balloons> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-autopilot-tests
[21:08] <balloons> trello board is here:https://trello.com/board/autopilot-tests/50e735ad7351f0a64e00040c
[21:11] <Ade> balloons, my first exposure to Trello... love it!! Just absorbing now...
=== salem_ is now known as _salem
[21:16] <Ade> balloons, right my weekend objective is to break out and grasp autopilot - 24hr challenge, to turn a newbie into a fully functioning autopilot... pilot? You up??
[21:20] <balloons> ade, i think you can do it ;-)
[21:20] <balloons> I'm happy to help
[21:24] <Ade> balloons, ok silly questions aplenty beware, but I will do my upmost and look forward to being on board. Am offski very soon so any suggestion for light reading before zzz, wheres the best place to start?
[21:25] <balloons> my blog posts, are a nice walktrhough
[21:26] <balloons> theorangenotebook.com
[21:28] <Ade> Awesome, will read up and be on irc tomorrow morning UTC
[21:34] <balloons> ade, when are you about?
[21:34] <balloons> in utc?
[21:36] <Ade> balloons, 10am strong (it's a Sat after all!), you?
[21:36] <balloons> i'd have to convert to my local time :-
[21:37] <balloons> i'd probably be around late UTC
[21:38] <Ade> You NY yes?
[21:39] <balloons> yes, EST
[21:47] <Ade> No wonder, that's why I think you never sleep! I will swat up, hit it hard and then when you wake I will (hopefully) have at least a grasp of it.
[21:47] <balloons> lol indeed
[21:50] <Ade> ha!
[21:56] <Ade> ** note to self, mention autopilot to wife tonight... karma and all that! :o)
[22:00] <balloons> alrighty, so let's see
[22:00] <balloons> in UTC, say 1500?
[22:04] <Ade> Sounds good
[22:07] <Ade> In the mean time I will read as much auto pilot as I can. Laters
[22:08] <Ade> Finally submitted that last test case! zzz now
[22:11] <Ade> 9/9 Mandatory test cases - why aren't we doing that every day!
[22:11] <Ade> Ubu - desk - 64 of course :o)
[22:15] <balloons> thanks ade!
[22:15] <balloons> I'll see you around tomorrow mate
[22:16] <Ade> Will do, grab some zzz's!
