[02:57] <oitofelix> Hello.  I'm using lubuntu 12.10 and I installed Tunapie 2 to listen to audio streams.  But unfortunately when I run Tunapie it just hangs when downloading the radio list.  Is there anyone successfully running Tunapie 2 right now?
=== IdleOne is now known as io
[11:51] <delldim> hi. I cant display 1920 1080 resolution. I have an acer 23" monitor. How do i make it display that resolution?
[11:52] <delldim> it says cant get gamma output
[11:56] <delldim> hello?
[11:58] <user92223> problem with bluetooth manager > file browser.  It wants to use "thunar" but I want to use pcmanfm. How to make it?
[11:59] <user92223> Error:Failed to launch "thunar"
[11:59] <user92223> "You can enter an alternate browser in service settings"
[11:59] <user92223> Where are the "service settings" so I can enter pcmanfm?
[12:08] <delldim> i also tried testing res dynamically:
[12:08] <delldim> xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1920x1080
[12:08] <delldim> xrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default
[12:08] <delldim> warning: output LVDS not found; ignoring
[12:08] <delldim> the same error occured using VGA1
[12:10] <delldim> user92223: do you use desktop ?
[12:10] <user92223> delldim,  yes, LXDE
[12:10] <delldim> ok me too
[12:10] <delldim> i have an acer mon 23 "
[12:11] <user92223> <using Lenovo Thinkpad Laptop.  Must admit Lubuntu works great.
[12:12] <user92223> WiFi, SDcard, Video, Audio, Flash, Java, and bluetooth all work fine.  Just tweaking the bluetooth file browser.
[12:14] <user92223> ok awesome.  I'm using Lubuntu to browse files on my Android smart phone via bluetooth wireless.
[12:15] <user92223> I installed "Thunar".  Fixed the bluetooth problem.  Works now. :- )
[12:16] <delldim> ahh
[12:16] <delldim> so not using a desktop
[12:16] <delldim> i have a desktop dell dimension 9200
[12:16] <user92223> sorry, I thought you meant desktop as in LXDE or KDE
[12:16] <delldim> ok;)
[12:17] <user92223> delldim... monitor isn't working?
[12:18] <delldim> the 1920 1080 diaply is not appearing as an option
[12:18] <delldim> display
[12:19] <delldim> xrandr output gives me:
[12:19] <delldim> xrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default
[12:19] <delldim> Screen 0: minimum 640 x 480, current 1024 x 768, maximum 1024 x 768
[12:19] <delldim> default connected 1024x768+0+0 0mm x 0mm
[12:20] <delldim> and i do have a monitor and a nvidia card to display it cos it works in windows 7, centos, fedora, mint linux and os on
[12:20] <delldim> i use nvidia gt 630 :)
[12:23] <user92223> delldim. I found a tutorial how to fix it.   http://samuelmartin.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/enabling-resolutions-in-ubuntu-12-04-lubuntu-12-04/
[12:23] <delldim> thnx)
[12:23] <delldim> :)
[12:23] <delldim> let me check
[12:24] <user92223> not sure if it works or not. worth a try.
[12:30] <delldim> hmm im not sure what to put in device - in the example it says hdmi but that doesnt appear on my output
[12:31] <delldim> it just says connected to default and i dont know what my default is
[12:31] <delldim> it doesnt say vga or hdmi on device
[12:31] <delldim> in my output
[12:32] <user92223> are you using hdmi?
[12:32] <user92223> i'd say enter whatever device you used before.
[12:32] <delldim> but i am connected to a hdmi cable
[12:32] <user92223> should be hdmi then
[12:33] <delldim> if i remember correctly it says that when im using xrandr on my other linux distros
[12:34] <delldim> ok i saved the xorg.conf file in the leafpad editor
[12:35] <delldim> so now i will restart to check then
[12:36] <delldim> ill be back;)
[12:44] <delldim> im back
[12:44] <delldim> ;)
[12:45] <user92223> thank goodness.  For a moment I thought you had the black screen of death
[12:45] <delldim> i got a black screen probably cos i didnt enter the devices correctly
[12:45] <delldim> i did get the black screen
[12:45] <delldim> im on centos now lol
[12:45] <delldim> my xrandr output from centos is:
[12:46] <delldim> Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 8192 x 8192
[12:46] <delldim> DVI-I-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
[12:46] <delldim> DVI-I-2 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 510mm
[12:46] <delldim> but im not sure how to enter it into the device section
[12:47] <user92223> ah... looks like the device is DVI-I-2
[12:47] <delldim> it is
[12:47] <delldim> i thought i had hdmi but apprantly not;9
[12:48] <delldim> so do i just enter DVI-I-1 or DVI-I-2 ?
[12:49] <user92223> i would enter with DVI-I-2 exactly like that.
[12:50] <user92223> I also had another idea:  To install the Nvidia Proprietary driver in Preferences >> "additional drivers".  (if you are using Nvidia and can't get the default driver working).
[12:50] <delldim> thnx:) allright, and why not DVI-I-1 ?
[12:50] <user92223> trial and error really.
[12:50] <delldim> thnx i will install them too;)
[12:50] <delldim> yes trial and error;)
[12:51] <delldim> i had to reconfigure with mint linux too but it was another way to edit the xorg file and add resolution ;)
[12:51] <delldim> centos and fedora went automatically
[12:52] <delldim> did u fix your problem?
[12:53] <user92223> yes.  All working fine here.
[12:53] <delldim> good for you
[12:53] <delldim> what other distros have you tested out?
[12:54] <user92223> Fedora, Puppy Linux, OpenBSD, Minix, Suse & others
[12:55] <user92223> I prefer Lubuntu for my pcs now.
[12:57] <user92223> actually I just deleted Windows Vista and installed Lubuntu.  Bought a PC with an unregistered Vista that expired in 4 days so i deleted it.
[12:57] <delldim> i see;)
[12:57] <delldim> im using windows 7 alongside lubuntu and centos
[12:58] <delldim> next i will test out dragonflybsd and gentoo
[13:00] <user92223> ah..i have used dragonfly bsd a long time ago.  BSD is OK but lacks the packages that ubuntu has.
[13:01] <delldim> ya iwant to try it cos its something appealing with a minimalistic Linux OS
[13:02] <delldim> you learn more about how to configure your system
[13:02] <user92223> that's true, if you're up for a challenge :- )
[13:04] <user92223> i built openBSD from commandline into a desktop system that resembled puppy linux.  Took a while and learned a LOT about BSD.
[13:05] <user92223> Keep a lot of notes.  Still have my bsd notes lying around on my table.
[13:06] <delldim> yes;)
[13:06] <delldim> maybe when i try out dragonfly i will ask you about that too, im sure i will run into some problems along the way
[13:07] <user92223> no worries.
[13:07] <delldim> thnx;)
[13:08] <user92223> You will find that BSD lacks packages for example, gparted and no flashplayer. But there is a linux compatibility system to run linux apps if you know how.
[13:08] <delldim> how to get past the black screen by the way when re editing the xorg.conf file?
[13:10] <delldim> oh thnx for that tip. For BSD cant you just download gparted manually and unpack it thne install it?
[13:11] <user92223> no, gparted doesnt exist for bsd.   It might work in compatibility mode but i never tried it.  You'll have to format disks using command line.
[13:11] <delldim> aha
[13:11] <delldim> wow bsd is really minimalistic then;)
[13:12] <user92223> also bsd kernel lacks a video frame buffer.  But most people wouldn't need to use that though.
[13:13] <delldim> ya:) bsd is for programmers and those who want to dive into the OS code and so on;)
[13:13] <user92223> don't think bsd supports nvidia proprietary drivers either.
[13:13] <user92223> or was that ati?  One or the other.
[13:13] <delldim> so how do i solve the video driver prpblem in case it doesnt boot at all?
[13:14] <user92223> may have to boot into text mode or possibly force a vesa boot.. If i can remember how..
[13:14] <delldim> ya i tried netbsd the other day but i cant get passed the login after the first boot actually
[13:15] <delldim> i set the passwd and i know i typed it correctly
[13:15] <delldim> but it just says incorrect and terminal refused it
[13:15] <delldim> i used the entire disk for it also
[13:16] <delldim> login is the name of the disk i assume and then the password which says incorrect
[13:16] <user92223> i think login is your username isn't it?
[13:17] <delldim> ya but username is name of the disk which u get to enter
[13:17] <delldim> i dont get a dialog where it says enter username
[13:18] <user92223> hmm not sure.
[13:19] <delldim> let me know if you try it and see what happens
[13:20] <delldim> and i install my distros directly to my hdd not using VM Ware
[13:21] <delldim> by the way how do i get passed the black screen?
[13:22] <user92223> just a moment i'm rebooting lubuntu on my other pc
[13:22] <delldim> ok;)
[13:25] <user92223> delldim:  Do you have dual boot with grub menu?
[13:25] <delldim> yes
[13:25] <delldim> centos, win7 and lubuntu
[13:26] <delldim> i got win7 on a 2nd disk
[13:26] <delldim> and linux distros on my main hdd
[13:27] <user92223> there is a recovery mode but i'm not familiar with that.
[13:27] <delldim> ya i saw that earlier
[13:27] <user92223> I know you can boot into text mode and re-edit your xorg.conf file on command line.
[13:28] <delldim> can i edit from here
[13:28] <user92223> ok..that would be easiest then.
[13:28] <user92223> just use your other distro to access it.
[13:28] <delldim> yes;)
[13:28] <delldim> using dolhin to access the lubuntu distro
[13:29] <delldim> and some editor tool to edit the file
[13:29] <user92223> try "DVI-I-2" as the device perhaps.
[13:30] <delldim> but im not sure how to actually access the lubuntu disk cos it doesnt show up using dolphin
[13:32] <user92223> what does "df -l"  say?
[13:33] <delldim> dev/sdb1             20158332   5023876  14929680  26% /
[13:33] <delldim> tmpfs                  1928100       524   1927576   1% /dev/shm
[13:33] <delldim> /dev/sr0                714028    714028         0 100% /media/Lubuntu 12.04 amd64
[13:33] <delldim> and last
[13:33] <delldim> /dev/sdb5             17300888   2728444  13693596  17% /media/disk
[13:34] <user92223> what's on /media/disk ?
[13:35] <delldim> either lubuntu or centos im not sure
[13:35] <user92223> if it has /usr/share/lubuntu than that's it.
[13:35] <user92223> /media/disk/usr/share/lubuntu
[13:37] <delldim> ok i press media directory from dolphin disk utility
[13:37] <delldim> then i got lubuntu 12.04 amd and when i press clicked here it was empty
[13:38] <user92223> ah well it's probably not mounted.
[13:39] <delldim> ya can i mount it from here
[13:39] <user92223> need to find which partition contains lubuntu.  Try this:  sudo fdisk -l
[13:40] <delldim> ya my sudo doesnt work in cent os so i have to use su
[13:40] <delldim> it says im not a sudoer ;)
[13:40] <user92223> ok
[13:41] <delldim> this is what i have:
[13:41] <delldim> Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
[13:41] <delldim> /dev/sdb1   *           1        2550    20480000   83  Linux
[13:41] <delldim> /dev/sdb2            2550        3634     8704000   82  Linux swap / Solaris
[13:41] <delldim> then
[13:41] <delldim> /dev/sdb3            3634        5822    17576961    5  Extended
[13:41] <delldim> /dev/sdb5            3634        5822    17576960   83  Linux
[13:43] <user92223> looks like /dev/sdb3
[13:43] <delldim> ok
[13:44] <user92223> since you already have /dev/sdb5 mounted on /media/disk and it's empty (you say).
[13:44] <delldim> ya it was empy when i clicked on the lubuntu 12.04 directory
[13:45] <user92223> strange becuse it says /dev/sdb5 is 17% full.
[13:45] <delldim> ahh it says cant enter folder
[13:45] <user92223> so it's either sdb3 or sdb5
[13:46] <delldim> media/disk/Lubuntu 12.04
[13:46] <user92223> you would need to mount them and explore the directories.
[13:46] <delldim> ya how do i mount them?
[13:46] <user92223> try this:   ls -a /media/disk/Lu*
[13:47] <delldim> ok says no such file or directory
[13:47] <delldim> and cannot access it
[13:47] <delldim> ls: cannot access /media/disk/Lu*: No such file or directory
[13:48] <user92223> is that Lubuntu or lubuntu (lower case?)
[13:49] <delldim> the directory is titled Lubuntu 12.04 amd64 so Uppercase on L
[13:52] <delldim> in my sda disk i get this error message Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.
[13:52] <delldim> i dont know if that affects this
[13:53] <delldim> sda is where i have win7
[13:55] <user92223> i'm thinking:  Mount sdb3 and see what's there.  Not sure why you can't access sdb5 on /media/disk/Lubuntu*
[13:55] <delldim> ok
[13:55] <delldim> how do i mount it?
[13:56] <user92223> mkdir /media/disk2
[13:56] <user92223> mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb3 /media/disk2
[13:57] <user92223> cd /media/disk2
[13:57] <user92223> ls
[13:57] <delldim> i got this error:
[13:57] <delldim> mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb3,
[13:57] <delldim>        missing codepage or helper program, or other error
[13:57] <delldim>        In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
[13:57] <user92223> ah. thought so.. change ext4 to whatever filesystem you have such as ext3 or whatever.
[13:58] <delldim> yes but i have ext4
[13:58] <user92223> did you put a space between ext4 and /dev/sdb3 ?
[13:59] <user92223> and use your su command
[13:59] <delldim> yes i copied it
[13:59] <delldim> yes im in root
[14:00] <delldim> mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb3 /media/disk
[14:01] <user92223> actually:   /media/disk2
[14:01] <delldim> mkdir worked
[14:02] <delldim> oh so how exactly do i do it?
[14:02] <delldim> mount -t ext4 /media/disk
[14:02] <delldim> ?
[14:02] <delldim> mount -t ext4 /media/disk2
[14:02] <user92223> yes.
[14:03] <user92223> mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb3 /media/disk2
[14:03] <user92223> that "should" mount it.
[14:03] <delldim> Usage: mount -V                 : print version
[14:03] <delldim>        mount -h                 : print this help
[14:03] <delldim>        mount                    : list mounted filesystems
[14:03] <delldim> then i got this
[14:04] <delldim> lastly:
[14:04] <delldim> A device can be given by name, say /dev/hda1 or /dev/cdrom,
[14:04] <delldim> or by label, using  -L label  or by uuid, using  -U uuid .
[14:04] <delldim> Other options: [-nfFrsvw] [-o options] [-p passwdfd].
[14:06] <user92223> it's probably NOT sdb3 then..Looks like a blank extended partition.
[14:06] <user92223> Go back to sdb5.
[14:07] <delldim> ok try the same only replacing it with sdb5 ?
[14:07] <user92223> first unmount it
[14:07] <user92223> umount /dev/sdb3
[14:07] <user92223> then try again.
[14:08] <delldim> ya except it was never mounted
[14:08] <user92223> mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb5 /media/disk2
[14:08] <delldim> i got not mounted now when i tried to unmount using umount /dev/sdb3
[14:09] <user92223> ok.  Mount it like i said above.
[14:09] <delldim> ok nothign happened
[14:09] <delldim> just a new # promtp
[14:09] <delldim> means it was mounted i guess
[14:09] <user92223> cd /media/disk2
[14:10] <user92223> try to enter the filesystem now.
[14:10] <delldim> ok im in disk2 now
[14:10] <delldim> i did an ls -l and the usual filesystem was listed, boot,usr and os on
[14:11] <user92223> ok..now you got to find your xorg config file.
[14:11] <delldim> using locate?
[14:11] <delldim> result:
[14:11] <delldim> /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
[14:11] <delldim> /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
[14:12] <user92223> know how to use a cli text editor?
[14:12] <user92223> or use your gui text editor.
[14:12] <user92223> leafpad usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.confd
[14:12] <user92223> (change leafpad to whatever editor you have)
[14:13] <delldim> i usually use nano
[14:13] <delldim> for low level editing
[14:13] <user92223> nano usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.confd
[14:14] <delldim> file is empty
[14:14] <user92223> was that the same file you edited before?
[14:15] <user92223> the file where you added hdmi as the default?
[14:16] <delldim> no it cant file the 10 monitor file
[14:16] <delldim> it only locates two xorg.conf.d files
[14:17] <delldim> u forgot the . in confd
[14:17] <delldim> but i tried nano usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf.d aswell and still just an empty file
[14:18] <delldim> i did save the file cos i checked it before i rebooted
[14:18] <user92223> What files are listed here?    ls -a  /media/disk2/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d      ??
[14:18] <user92223> (don't add the ??)
[14:19] <delldim> this is what i found using locate:
[14:19] <delldim> [root@localhost ~]# locate *.conf.d
[14:19] <delldim> /etc/dracut.conf.d
[14:19] <delldim> /etc/ld.so.conf.d

[14:19] <delldim> /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d
[14:19] <delldim> /etc/polkit-1/nullbackend.conf.d
[14:19] <delldim> /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
[14:19] <delldim> /usr/share/doc/oddjob-0.30/sample/etc/oddjobd.conf.d
[14:20] <user92223> err...you're looking into CentOS's filesystem.
[14:20] <delldim> ok
[14:20] <user92223> you need to look into /media/disk/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
[14:20] <delldim> so we mounted my current OS
[14:21] <user92223> show me what files are in that directory above.
[14:22] <delldim> in X11 is :

[14:23] <delldim> ahh there
[14:23] <delldim> i saw it
[14:23] <user92223> see 10-monitor.conf
[14:23] <user92223> Do this:
[14:23] <delldim> im in the file now
[14:23] <delldim> with nano
[14:23] <user92223> nano /media/disk/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf
[14:24] <delldim> ya im in already;)
[14:24] <delldim> i changed it to DVI-I-2
[14:24] <delldim> in device
[14:24] <user92223> cool..don't forget to save ;- )
[14:26] <delldim> ya it makes sence using DVI-I-2 cos it says connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 510
[14:26] <user92223> hope it works
[14:26] <delldim> it looks like its this that is used for connection
[14:26] <delldim> thnx ok i will reboot and let you know
[14:26] <user92223> ok
[14:27] <delldim> and not recovery but the regualr one
[14:27] <delldim> i also have to edit the grub file to set nomodeset so i dont have to change in each time in the grub menu;)
[14:27] <delldim> otherwise i get a freeze and some color stripes
[14:28] <delldim> probably to do with the hardware graphics card not supprting quite splash
[14:33] <delldim> still black screen
[14:35] <delldim> u there;)
[14:35] <user92223> ok..that's no good.  I can only suggest restoring that file back to it's default.
[14:36] <user92223> however it was when you booted in last. (if you can remember).
[14:37] <delldim> well there must be something i mistyped
[14:37] <delldim> i could try accesing it again
[14:37] <user92223> what was the device before you edited it.
[14:37] <delldim> mounting it
[14:37] <delldim> it was empty or said <put your device name here> i think
[14:38] <user92223> i think we created that file..so just delete it i'd say
[14:38] <delldim> ya but its not there now
[14:39] <delldim> it found 0 files when i re entered the xorg.conf.d directory
[14:39] <user92223> cd /media/disk/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
[14:40] <user92223> then delete 10-monitor.conf
[14:40] <delldim> yes except is empty in that directory
[14:41] <user92223> sure the /dev/sdb3 is mounted?
[14:41] <user92223> sorry sdb5
[14:41] <user92223> when you reboot it probably unmounted sdb5
[14:42] <user92223> you must be very frustrated by now ;- )
[14:42] <user92223> oh the joys of linux..
[14:42] <delldim> lol
[14:43] <user92223> mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb5 /media/disk2
[14:43] <delldim> ok just checked again and its empty
[14:43] <delldim> so i need to remount it
[14:43] <user92223> yes
[14:43] <delldim> mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb5 /media/disk2
[14:44] <delldim> [root@localhost xorg.conf.d]# ls -l
[14:44] <delldim> total 0
[14:44] <delldim> [root@localhost xorg.conf.d]
[14:44] <delldim> still nothing
[14:44] <delldim> i mounted it when i was in xorg.conf.d dir
[14:45] <user92223> shouldn't matter.  Do this:
[14:45] <user92223> ls -a /media/disk/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
[14:46] <delldim> [root@localhost xorg.conf.d]# ls -a
[14:46] <delldim> .  ..
[14:46] <delldim> [root@localhost xorg.conf.d]#
[14:47] <delldim> if i do the entire ls -a /media/disk/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d or la -l /media... i get no such file or directory
[14:47] <delldim> i have to manually cd to the directory
[14:47] <user92223> sorry i made a mistake. do this:
[14:47] <delldim> i have to use / to get to some dir and just cd on others
[14:48] <user92223> ls -a /media/disk2/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
[14:48] <delldim> root@localhost ~]# ls -a /media/disk2/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
[14:48] <delldim> .   10-evdev.conf    11-evdev-quirks.conf      50-synaptics.conf  50-wacom.conf
[14:48] <delldim> ..  10-monitor.conf  11-evdev-trackpoint.conf  50-vmmouse.conf    51-synaptics-quirks.conf
[14:48] <delldim> so that one worked
[14:49] <delldim> i also see the file there
[14:49] <delldim> but how do i access it
[14:50] <user92223> rm s -a /media/disk/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf
[14:50] <user92223> sorry..don't do that.
[14:50] <delldim> ok i didnt;)
[14:50] <user92223> correction:   rm  /media/disk/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf
[14:51] <user92223> That should delete the problem file.
[14:51] <delldim> [root@localhost ~]# rm  /media/disk/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf
[14:51] <delldim> rm: cannot remove `/media/disk/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf': No such file or directory
[14:51] <user92223>  rm  /media/disk2/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf
[14:51] <user92223> try that.
[14:51] <delldim> ok that worked
[14:52] <delldim> i wrote yes
[14:52] <user92223> good. that file should be deleted and can reboot.
[14:52] <delldim> thnx;)
[14:52] <user92223> i would install the nvidia proprietary drivers after reboot.
[14:52] <delldim> i just dont understand what i mistyped
[14:52] <delldim> yes i will do that
[14:52] <user92223> me either..wierd..  Need an xorg expert
[14:54] <delldim> yes
[14:54] <delldim> ok so reeboting and installing additional drivers
[14:55] <user92223> All the best.  Hope it works this time.
[14:55] <delldim> without editing the xorg file right+
[14:55] <delldim> ?
[14:55] <delldim> just the drivers?
[14:55] <user92223> yeah...you can install nvidia proprietary from the menu (if your driver is available).
[14:55] <delldim> k;)
[14:57] <delldim> ok back in lubuntu
[14:57] <delldim> so where do i find the drivers
[14:58] <user92223> menu > preferences > additional drivers
[14:58] <delldim> ok thnx
[15:00] <delldim> dialog box appeared and it says no prop drivers are in use on this system
[15:00] <user92223> what's your nvidia card?
[15:00] <delldim> below are three options
[15:00] <delldim> gt 630
[15:00] <user92223> what options are displayed?
[15:00] <delldim> first is post release, second is beta and third is also betas
[15:01] <delldim> first beta is 304 second 310
[15:01] <delldim> 310 is the latest probably
[15:02] <user92223> They're your drivers id say.
[15:02] <delldim> the 310 ?
[15:02] <user92223> i'm just checking
[15:02] <user92223> but i'm guessing....Yes.
[15:02] <delldim> ok so i select that one and activate driver by clicking radio button where it says driver is not activated?
[15:03] <user92223> yes.
[15:03] <delldim> ok i chose 310 and its downloading
[15:04] <delldim> and installing
[15:04] <delldim> thats the one for windows 7 also
[15:05] <delldim> its their newest
[15:05] <user92223> well that would be it.
[15:06] <user92223> hopefully it will support all your resolutions.
[15:06] <delldim> ok i need to restart
[15:07] <delldim> to get it to work;)
[15:07] <delldim> so back in a bit;)
[15:07] <user92223> k
[15:09] <delldim> it worked!
[15:09] <delldim> thanks:)
[15:09] <user92223> good.
[15:09] <delldim> well this was different;)
[15:09] <delldim> a new lubuntu world
[15:09] <user92223> how's the resolutions?
[15:09] <delldim> delldim@delldim-Dell-DXP061:~$ xrandr
[15:09] <delldim> Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 16384 x 16384
[15:09] <delldim> DVI-I-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
[15:09] <delldim> DVI-I-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
[15:09] <delldim> DVI-I-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
[15:09] <delldim> HDMI-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
[15:09] <delldim> DVI-I-3 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 510
[15:10] <user92223> interesting...DVI-I-3.
[15:10] <delldim> so now that is fixed the things left are the mysterious netbsd
[15:10] <delldim> and testing dragonflybsd
[15:11] <delldim> ;)
[15:11] <delldim> yes it connected to a new DVi
[15:11] <user92223> so it's DVI-I-3.  Not HDMI-I-2
[15:12] <user92223> the device.
[15:12] <delldim> yes
[15:12] <delldim> i use dvi and not hdmi so i need to get a hold of a hdmi cable
[15:12] <user92223> that would explain why hdmi wasn't showing
[15:12] <delldim> yep
[15:12] <delldim> but i doubt there is a difference between them;)
[15:13] <delldim> do i get sharper contrast with hdmi ?
[15:13] <user92223> don't know. never used hdmi.
[15:13] <user92223> I'm an old school vga guy.
[15:14] <delldim> lol
[15:14] <delldim> hehe
[15:14] <delldim> a little detail there
[15:15] <delldim> well i have to say that i do get sharp contrast using my dvi
[15:15] <delldim> but would be fun to test hdmi of course;)
[15:15] <delldim> to compare
[15:15] <user92223> yes.. My laptop has hdmi but my monitors are vga. ( i buy them cheap)
[15:16] <delldim> oh so how does that work when one got a hmdi laptop and hdmi cabel versus a hdmi cabel and vga laptop
[15:16] <delldim> i mean vga monitor
[15:17] <delldim> i thought u had to have the same vga to vga and hdmi to hdmi
[15:17] <user92223> you can get a hdmi to vga adapter. But my laptop has vga output also so I use that.
[15:17] <delldim> ok;)
[15:17] <delldim> the best result is a hdmi output from the monitor and a hdmi cable ?
[15:18] <user92223> yeah, i'd say so.
[15:18] <delldim> ok;)
[15:19] <user92223> hdmi output from pc to hdmi monitor.
[15:19] <user92223> So that's a success story. Time for me to shutdown. Past midnight here.  Bye.
[15:20] <delldim> hehe
[15:20] <delldim> back now
[15:20] <delldim> i had to get food
[15:20] <delldim> ok so see you later then
[15:20] <delldim> ;)
[15:21] <delldim> thanks for your help
[15:49] <tramm> This is getting strange, the translation site http://pootle.lxde.bsnet.se/ is down for ages already
[15:49] <tramm> Is LXDE alive at all? http://wiki.lxde.org/en/How_to_translate_LXDE_components gives no other directions how to translate...
[15:49] <holstein> tramm: this is not an lxde channel.. its lubuntu, which uses LXDE
[15:50] <holstein> tramm: i find LXDE has issues like any other small un-funded community run project.. maybe not being able to pay bills, or secure URL's
[15:51] <holstein> tramm: lubuntu is alive.. LXDE is alive.. its open, and its an open community project, so LXDE is as alive as we make it
[15:51] <tramm> holstein, thanks for replying, but I'm trying to translate Lubuntu and I have already asked in LXDE channels for weeks.
[15:51] <holstein> tramm: LXDE is not lubuntu
[15:52] <holstein> tramm: maybe this will help.. they are 2 different projects.. if you want to help with translation on lubuntu, this is a good start
[15:52] <holstein> LXDE is a different project
[15:52] <tramm> holstein, why do you keep repeating that?
[15:52] <tramm> Lubuntu translation page refers to LXDE translations
[15:52] <holstein> tramm: because you stated "i have been trying to translate for lubuntu and asking in LXDE support channels"
[15:52] <tramm> holstein, I still don't get your point
[15:53] <holstein> tramm: LXDE support channels dont have anything to do with lubuntu
[15:53] <holstein> tramm: lubuntu just uses LXDE
[15:53] <tramm> Lubuntu uses LXDE and refers to LXDE translation instructions for translating Lubuntu
[15:54] <holstein> tramm: sure, but we dont share those development resources
[15:54] <tramm> holstein, are you suggesting that Lubuntu uses LXDE but doesn't care about it?
[15:54] <holstein> tramm: if you want to translate for lubuntu, then this is the place.. otherwise asking at LXDE is not going to work
[15:54] <holstein> tramm: its not that they dont care about it,.. its a different project
[15:54] <tramm> holstein, ok, let's do it this way... Yes, I want to translate Lubuntu very much! Help me!
[15:55] <holstein> tramm: ok.. stop asking in LXDE channels
[15:55] <holstein> tramm: /join #lubuntu-offtopic
[15:56] <holstein> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Translations
[15:56] <holstein> and ignore, or report the ones that are not working.. such as the LXDE specific ones
[15:57] <holstein> http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Category:Translations is a nice list of upstream dev's
[17:18] <greenwolf> was there a #lubuntu community meeting today in IRC?
[17:20] <holstein> greenwolf: xubuntu
[17:28] <greenwolf> i see so it was xubuntu that was having the community meeting not lubuntu?
[17:28] <greenwolf> well thanks for clearing that up form e
[17:29] <holstein> greenwolf: i saw the xubuntu meeting.. and i didnt see a lubuntu meeting.. if there were a lubuntu meeting, i would expect it in #lubuntu-offtopic
[17:34] <greenwolf> okthanks
[17:34] <greenwolf> i just got a copy of the log

[19:30] <holstein> looks good
[19:31] <ioria> yep.... so ? my pc is very old ...
[19:31] <ioria> pentium 3 e ram pc133
[19:31] <holstein> http://code.google.com/p/clementine-player/issues/detail?id=2991
[19:32] <holstein> ioria: are you up to date with upgrades?
[19:32] <ioria> sure ... i installed yesterday
[19:32] <holstein> ioria: are you upgraded though?
[19:32] <ioria> with netinstall from a mini iso
[19:32] <holstein> ioria: did you search for and apply upgrades?
[19:32] <ioria> yes
[19:33] <holstein> ioria: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade? or something like that?
[19:33] <ioria> come again, please ?
[19:33] <ioria> oh.... yes
[19:33] <holstein> where did you get clementine? the default repos?
[19:33] <ioria> sholud upgrade to 12.10 ?
[19:33] <ioria> yes
[19:34] <ioria> apt-get i add medibuntu repo
[19:34] <holstein> ioria: i wouldnt upgrade due to one piece of software.. with this little troubleshooting
[19:34] <ioria> i agree
[19:34] <Unit193> And if it is a P3, I'd bet not PAE.
[19:34] <ioria> when i touch the progressibe bar of clementine i heard something
[19:35] <holstein> i would use VLC on that hardware
[19:35] <Unit193> ioria: type   grep pae /proc/cpuinfo    and see if you have any output real quick.
[19:35] <holstein> or cvlc
[19:35] <ioria> flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 mtrr pge mca cmov pse36 mmx fxsr sse up
[19:36] <ioria> Unit193:
[19:36] <holstein> i get clementine : Depends: libchromaprint0 (>= 0.2) but it is not going to be installed
[19:37] <ioria> well... gnome-mplayer is good but i had to remove mplayer2 and add mplayer
[19:37] <Unit193> Wow.  So your hardware is actually compatible with the next version.
[19:37] <ioria> sure :------------------)
[19:37] <ioria> and it's great ... do you want my lspci ?
[19:37] <holstein> Unit193: can you install clementine in 12.04?
[19:38] <Unit193> holstein: The simulation works.
[19:39] <holstein> Unit193: whats the sim flag again?
[19:39] <Unit193> holstein: -s
[19:39] <holstein> "that was easy"
[19:41] <Unit193> Never used clementine, and not on 12.04 either.  I'd check volume, and see if pulse is installed.
[19:42] <holstein> Unit193: the sim worked for me too
[19:42] <holstein> now its working.. i think i had issue on my end...
[19:43] <holstein> i'll have to come back to it though.. im running late..
