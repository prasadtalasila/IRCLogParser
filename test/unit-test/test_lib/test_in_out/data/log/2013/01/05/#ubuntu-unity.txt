[10:12] <Zouave> hey, I've got a Geforce 400 and is blacklisted for unity, so I run unity 2d. Any update on this situation ?
[10:13] <Zouave> I don't want to rely on 12.04 with a soon-to-be obsolete unity 2d, and no ubuntu phone dev possible...
[10:13] <Zouave> typo : Geforce Go 7400
[13:50] <mardy> jbache: hi! I've a change to submit to qtdesktopcomponents (qt5), which I think could be easily testable by an auto test
[13:51] <mardy> jbache: can I add a tests/auto/ folder and all the stuff to get the automated tests run, or is there a reason why this hasn't been done already?
[13:51] <jbache> mardy: we are still trying to get CI working on playground projects
[13:51] <jbache> mardy: try out this patch and see if it works for you. We will try to push it next week https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,43612
[13:58] <mardy> jbache: I cannot generate a Makefile for tests.pro; looks like the "tests" directory isn't picked up by qmake
[13:59] <jbache> mardy: please comment on the gerrit page
[13:59] <mardy> jbache: I don't think it's a bug, but just me missing something :-)
[14:00] <mardy> jbache: also other Qt modules don't mention the "tests" directory in their main .pro file, yet there it works
[14:01] <jbache> mardy: there are some other patches for autotests by Liang (lqi), you might want to take a look at those too
[14:02] <jbache> mardy: as you can see, this is work in progress
[14:06] <mardy> jbache: mmm... I seem to be missing the QtTest QML plugin; maybe the Ubuntu packages are missing it
[14:07] <jbache> mardy: careful about the Ubuntu packages. Afaik it is only Beta 2 of Qt 5
[14:07] <jbache> mardy: I am sure that will be resolved before the final though
[14:07] <mardy> jbache: there are packages from the rc2 as well
[14:08] <jbache> mardy: ah allright. But yes, I suggest you just get the binaries from the qt-project site
[14:09] <jbache> mardy: Actually we already depend on a small patch to qttest which is not released yet
[14:09] <mardy> jbache: OK. For the time being I'll push to gerrit without adding tests, I'll revisit the thing next week
[14:10] <jbache> mardy: allright
[14:24] <mardy> jbache: mmm... when I try to instantiate Dialog in qt5 it tells me that the QtQuick.Window module is not installed; I guess that's a problem of the Ubuntu packages
[14:26] <jbache> mardy: certainly.
[16:41] <mardy> jbache: now that I got a working qt5 installation, the Dialog class is still broken. I'll submit a fix, hopefully today
[17:27] <ben_> Forgive me if I'm in the incorrect irc, but I have a bit of a problem and need to ask for help..
[17:28] <ben_> I have an issue where sound ceases to function after a suspend/resume cycle, I have found the fix others claim works where you disable auto mute in alsamixer, but for me that option just isn't in alsamixer.. anyone have a fix for me?

[22:22] <markmm> Is it possible for unity to remember which apps/windows I had and restore them at next login? 12.10
[22:45] <mhall119> markmm: technically the gnome-session-manager would do that
[22:45] <mhall119> but it requires apps to know about it and work with it
[22:45] <mhall119> and most apps sadly don't
[23:14] <markmm> mhall119, Bummer, might try scripting it somehow
