[05:14] <coolbhavi> finally highvoltage is back on the ARB list
[05:14] <coolbhavi> :)
[05:15] <ajmitch> yay
[05:18] <highvoltage> heh :)
[05:18] <highvoltage> thanks for the welcome, coolbhavi
[05:19] <coolbhavi> phew glad that you are back!
[05:20] <highvoltage> there's a lot to be done. I think there are some ways we could put a bit more responsibilities on the submitters before submitting
[05:20] <highvoltage> it would be nice if they could go through a checklist of basic things to check if it matches policy, at least
[05:21] <highvoltage> then it could potentially get to a point where an app just takes 5 minutes before it's rejected or accepted
[05:21] <highvoltage> and it should be either one of those (I know that's easier said than done :p)
[05:24] <coolbhavi> yes :) thats one part but there should be a link to policy guidelines in myapps before the app developer submits his app
[05:24] <coolbhavi> and thats one of the reasons behind the app dev spec I believe
[05:26] <coolbhavi> or now that lintian is in place we could interface the same I think for now so that manual review gets less load
[05:26] <highvoltage> yeah
[05:31] <coolbhavi> I'll fire a quick post to the list then thanks!
