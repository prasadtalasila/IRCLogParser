[09:24] <cking> and also I need to try out c8b74c2f6604923de91f8aa6539f8bb934736754
[09:26] <infinity> henrix: FYI, #1040557 could be hard to verify in anything other than quantal, given that it relies on booting in EFI mode, which we didn't support until Q...
[09:26] <infinity> henrix: (Just noticed your comment on the bug asking to test it on oneiric)
[09:27] <henrix> infinity: right, i took a look at the patch and didn't realised the 
[09:27] <henrix> infinity: 'oneiric' part...
[09:28] <henrix> infinity: thanks for the heads up
[09:28] <infinity> (I'm not actually sure why we backported this back to 3.2 and 3.0, though it doesn't hurt to have it there either)
[09:28] <infinity> cking: ?
[09:28] <infinity> Oh, wait.  No.
[09:29] <infinity> We support booting EFI mode on precise (and maybe oneiric).  I'm half asleep.
[09:29] <infinity> But this bricking issue was only happening on Q kernels, wasn't it?
[09:29]  * infinity shrugs.
[09:29] <infinity> No harm either way, the patch is simple enough.
[09:31]  * cking thought that prevention at all levels is better than bricking
[09:31] <infinity> cking: Yeah, I'm not inclined to disagree.
[09:32] <infinity> Just could be harder to validate this one than most.
[09:32] <infinity> The weird catch-22 of "if it previously bricked machines, no one wants to test" (though, Samsung should be testing quantal for us there) and "if it didn't brick before, all we can verify is that your disabling bit worked" (oneiric and precise, I think).
[09:33] <cking> infinity, indeed
[09:33] <cking> who wants to test something that may brick one's machine?
[09:33] <infinity> Pick me, pick me!
[09:33] <smb`> donkey
=== smb` is now known as smb
[09:34] <cking> as it was, we had jsalisbury did test this patch for me on a later kernel in the non-UEFI mode. the regression risk is really minimal
[09:34] <smb> Obviously Samsung should test on their machines... they may even have some unbrick option... :-P
[09:35] <cking> unbrick uption is "get a new motherboard"
[09:35] <infinity> Well, "replcace the firmware" but, yeah, without bootstrap pre-firmware flashy bits (which either they lack, or their service centres don't know how to use?), it's a new motherboard for end users.
[09:36] <smb> But the worst case we can get would be users whining about lost functionality on older releases. IF it ever did work without bricking
[09:36] <infinity> I assume Samsung themselves fix it with a slightly less large hammer.
[09:38]  * cking not sure how we proceed on this - my preference is to say it should go through w/o verification 
[09:39] <infinity> cking: I want verification to the nth degree from Samsung on the Quantal kernel, but for P and O, I'm happy with someone just booting them and saying "yep, the module's disabled now".
[09:39] <infinity> cking: Cause I'm pretty sure P and O weren't bricking things (though we've never had a straight answer there, the bug reports all seem to be Qish)
[09:40] <cking> infinity, I will prod joseph later today to see if I can get him to re-test with Q
[09:40]  * apw yawns
[09:40] <infinity> Cause once I can get Samsung to say "yes, this fixes the world, yay", I intend to respin the quantal/amd64 images with the kernel update and stop the madness.
[09:40] <smb> Maybe nobody really ran those releases in UEFI mode back then. Which is now more often caused be the other OS requirement
[09:40] <cking> have we direct access to Samsung to get this tested ASAP then?
[09:41] <infinity> smb: Tis possible that the laptops recently switched to being EFI by default instead of legacy but, even then, you'd expect a fair number of LTS installs.
[09:41] <infinity> cking: AFAIK, we have some Samsung people standing by to test, but they're not "Linux people", so we'll need to produce an image and hand-hold them through it.
[09:41] <infinity> cking: I'll be trying to make sure that happens this week.
[09:42] <apw> that does match my information
[09:42] <cking> infinity, thanks for the handling that :-)
[09:42] <smb> infinity, True. At least nowish. Ok, people would need a second computer to open the bug report to shout at us. And blame it on the install rather on crappy hw

[15:52] <smb> apw, Are you aware of packaging changes regarding libcrypto in raring. Something that definitely did compile before the holidays now fails in the configure stage. *grr*
[15:53] <apw> smb, i am not indeed, might be worth asking on #ubuntu+1-maint though
[15:53] <smb> apw, will do...
[15:54] <arges> smb: which package
[15:54] <smb> arges, xen :-P
[15:54] <arges> smb: i see xen-api/xen-api-libs on ftbfs only for armhf/powerpc
[15:56] <smb> arges, Its the main xen package and even the version currently in the archive now fails in my sbuild environment...
[15:57] <arges> smb: do you have a link to the failing .dsc?
[15:58] <apw> dobey, most of the things you can change are changable from /etc/default/grub2

[16:05] <sforshee> but I've had a thermal shutdown on this machine

[16:09] <smb> arges, No worries. I am on it anyway. Just wanted to find out whether this is sort of known
[16:09] <xnox> Hello, kernels hackers =) does anyone has any hardware that can build ndiswrapper dkms module and load any driver to see if ndiswrapper works?
[16:09] <arges> smb: cool. also did you see the crash patch I attached? added 'binutils' as a Depends. I think you are maintainer right?
[16:10]  * xnox fixed it in raring and now I want to SRU it back to quantal & precise, as it is broken in quantal & precise is getting quantal kernel.
[16:10] <apw> xnox, not me, i wonder if tseliot might
[16:11] <smb> arges, I saw it. And yep, suppose I am sort of.

[16:32] <jsalisbury> sforshee, v3.8-rc2 seems to resolve it, but the bug is against raring and not quantal
[16:34] <sforshee> jsalisbury, apw: if it's a regression in raring then I shouldn't be affected since I'm using precise + quantal hwe
[16:34] <sforshee> in practice s/r didn't seem to change anything
[16:35] <sforshee> once my machine hits 95C the temperature starts backing off
[16:35] <apw> man that seems hot to me
[16:35] <sforshee> that's not the normal temp, that's with everything loaded
[16:36] <sforshee> right now it's at 60C
[16:38] <apw> i guess my old clunker just doesn't get so hot
[16:39] <jsalisbury> sforshee, I can get my x201 to hit 100C by loading it up.  I've been able to do it from 2.6 all the way up to 3.8-rc2.  It's interesting it's just started happening to you though.
[16:40] <sforshee> jsalisbury, well it's only happened this one time, and so far I can't reproduce it
[16:40] <jsalisbury> sforshee, I usually control the fan manually if I'm going to do something that loads it.
[16:40]  * apw whines about lenovos
[16:40] <sforshee> jsalisbury, what's odd is that I've done highly parallel kernel builds on this machine before without problem. I wasn't being anywhere near as abusive when it shut down.
[16:40] <cking> i3, and i5 seem OK, i7 based Lenovos seem to get quite toasty
[16:41] <sforshee> this is i7
[16:41] <sforshee> Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU       M 620  @ 2.67GHz
[16:41] <sforshee> westmere I believe
[16:41] <jsalisbury> sforshee, thats what I got too: model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU       M 620  @ 2.67GHz
[16:42] <cking> I've seen that with a fully loaded CPUs and minimal GPU usage these i7 based lenovos get really hot.
[16:43] <cking> and even Windows 7 users gripe about it being toasty hot
[16:43] <sforshee> cking, mine gets hot, but when it hits 95C something is kicking in to mitigate it. The temp immediately drops down to about 89 then starts ramping back up.
[16:43] <jsalisbury> sforshee, I can get my system to overheat by running a bunch of these silly little things in parallel:
[16:43] <jsalisbury> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1507070/
[16:44] <cking> sforshee, at 95 degrees C the CPU is scaled back I suspect
[16:44] <sforshee> i was using stress
[16:44] <sforshee> cking, likely
[16:45] <jsalisbury> sforshee, have you ever updated the bios?
[16:45] <cking> sforshee, the fan takes ~7 seconds to ramp upto full speed, so this means we have a window where the machine can't dump the excessive heat quick enough
[16:45] <sforshee> jsalisbury, I can't recall for sure, but not anytime recently
[16:46] <cking> passive cooling via CPU freq scaling is fairly fast, but even with the CPU scaled back it takes some time for the fan to dump the heat out of the laptop
[16:47] <jsalisbury> cking, and if the fan is partially blocked by dust, or by sitting on a soft surface, it takes even longer :-)
[16:48] <cking> jsalisbury, indeed. but the real kicker is that it seems that quite a few  i7 based Lenovos to get to the TjMax point really easily.
[16:50] <sforshee> this machine is sitting in a docking station on my desk just like usual. Actually there was nothing unusual at all.
[16:51] <sforshee> may have been some difficult-to-hit firmware or kernel bug
[16:52] <sforshee> anyway, I think I'll just keep an eye on my temperature for now and go back to my normal work
