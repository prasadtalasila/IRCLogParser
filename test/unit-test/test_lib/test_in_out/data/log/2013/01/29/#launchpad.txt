[00:10] <Andy80> hi
[00:11] <Andy80> I'm trying to set the branch for a project I just created and in the field "Link to a Bazaar branch already on Launchpad" I'd like to insert my code that is in "lp:~andreagrandi/qtcreator-ubuntu/trunk" but I don't know how. Any idea? It doesn't accept the value as is...
[00:12] <wgrant> Andy80: Try omitting the 'lp:'
[00:14] <Andy80> wgrant, thanks, it worked :)
[00:14] <wgrant> Great

[00:59] <DNS> heya
[00:59] <DNS> i wonder about this https://code.launchpad.net/~notgary/autogen/fix-1098872/+merge/145279
[00:59] <DNS> is this a bug?
[00:59] <DNS> why somebody can ask for merge with a git import?
[00:59] <DNS> how this would work? 0_o
[01:01] <DNS> like if i would accept this then the changes would stay in the lp:autogen repo and the imports still would work?
[01:02] <DNS> this is a bit unclear for me sorry :x
[01:02] <wgrant> DNS: Launchpad doesn't automatically do the merge.
[01:03] <wgrant> It's possible and sometimes useful, though usually undesirable, for someone to propose a merge into an import.
[01:05] <DNS> and if the changes would stay would the merge always apply with a new import?
[01:05] <DNS> and if the "diff" fails?
[01:06] <wgrant> What do you mean?
[01:06] <wgrant> Launchpad can't ensure that the merge won't conflict.
[01:36] <DNS> so i disapproved the merge ^^
[01:37] <wgrant> Probably a good plan :)
[01:57] <maxb> In a world where programmers had infinite time, there'd be a nice "Are you REALLY sure this is what you want to do?" dialogue inserted when trying to propose such a merge
[01:57] <wgrant> Ideally :)

[07:09] <shadeslayer> hi, I was wondering if someone could advise me on this error : https://launchpadlibrarian.net/129825238/buildlog.txt.gz
[07:09] <shadeslayer> is the 0.4 recipe format not supported for quantal?
[07:10] <wgrant> shadeslayer: Launchpad doesn't support 0.4 at all yet
[07:10] <shadeslayer> oh
[07:10] <shadeslayer> okay
[08:48] <bugbrains> hey
[08:48] <bugbrains> anyone seen this error before?

[15:49] <alkisg> Can we do something to prevent launchpad from doing daily translation commits even when there are no new translations?
[15:49] <alkisg> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ltsp-upstream/ltsp/ldm-trunk/changes ==> it happens there,
[15:49] <alkisg> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ltsp-upstream/ltsp/ltsp-trunk/changes ==> but not there (same project, LTSP)
[15:52] <alkisg> Is it possible that multiple servers are used for the branches, configured with different timezones, and that then launchpad thinks the date was changed, while it hasn't?
[15:53] <czajkowski> alkisg: no I dont think so tbh
[15:53] <czajkowski> if you could file a question I'll look into it
[15:54] <alkisg> Sure, thank you.
[15:54] <alkisg> Here's a clue - I'll write that in the question too: our pot file is more than 1 year old:      ldm.pot 1394  2011-07-13 04:47:23 UTC
[15:54] <alkisg> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ltsp-upstream/ltsp/ldm-trunk/files/head:/po/
[15:54] <alkisg> Yet launchpad says it was modified yesterday:
[15:54] <czajkowski> alkisg: again if you could just add this to the question
[15:54] <czajkowski> I can look into it from there
[15:54] <alkisg> Sure, I will
[15:54] <alkisg> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ltsp-upstream/ltsp/ldm-trunk/revision/1475#po/el.po
[15:54] <alkisg> "POT-Creation-Date: 2013-01-27 04:33+0000\n"
[15:55] <alkisg> OK, /me files question...

[15:59] <dobey> alkisg: is the .pot file getting modified with every commit to that tree?
[15:59] <alkisg> https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+question/220460
[16:00] <alkisg> dobey: in the .po files, launchpad says that the .pot has been modified,
[16:00] <alkisg> but we see no modifications in the source tree for ldm.pot
[16:00] <alkisg> czajkowski: ^ - thanks :)
[16:03] <dobey> oh, hrmm
[16:03] <czajkowski> dobey: Ill ask jtv when he's online later

[22:20] <TLoT> how long will PPA builders depwait for?
[22:21] <TLoT> before just giving up
[22:24] <wgrant> TLoT: They'll stay in depwait until the dependency is satisfied or they're manually retried.
[22:24] <TLoT> wgrant: so i just leave them there until the dependency in question builds within the PPA?
[22:24] <TLoT> (or, fails to build, depending on how you look at it :P)\
[22:24] <wgrant> TLoT: Right
[22:24] <TLoT> wgrant: how often does it check to see if deps are satisfied?
[22:25] <TLoT> and do PPAs auto-include their own packages in the build environment for the PPA?
[22:25] <wgrant> TLoT: Hourly
[22:25] <wgrant> And yes
[22:25] <TLoT> cool.  so i don't need to go beating the builders for being stupid today :P
[22:27] <czajkowski> not today at least no

[22:28] <TLoT> well... unless it turns the amd64 dependency's build time to something insane, like 12 hours...
