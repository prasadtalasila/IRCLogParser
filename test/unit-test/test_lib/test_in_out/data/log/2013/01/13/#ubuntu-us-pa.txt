[04:42] <ChinnoDog> yawn
[04:43] <ChinnoDog> 23:45
[04:46] <TheLordOfTime> what about it :P
[04:58] <ChinnoDog> It happened.
[04:58] <TheLordOfTime> so?
[05:33] <ChinnoDog> idk
[05:33] <ChinnoDog> I got some new glasses in the mail today. They are really nice.
[05:34] <ChinnoDog> And so inexpensive
[06:17] <Sadin> Hi all
[06:18] <InHisName> I've gotten about 5 pair so far.  Last pair I bumped the Rx by 1/4 and I like them better than 4 y/o ones earlier.  Eyes getting worse over time.  Two broke, and one was lost. 2 pair left.  All < $10 each with shipping.
[06:20] <ChinnoDog> How do you lose them so fast? My last pair must be 10 years old or so and I've never lost them. In fact, they are in great shape but the prescription is old.
[06:21] <ChinnoDog> I think I paid almost $400 for those. I ordered these online for around $80.
[06:26] <InHisName> Only lost pair in 50 years of glasses.   3 years ago.
[06:27] <ChinnoDog> The site I got mine from has a promo code for a free first pair.
[06:28] <ChinnoDog> Just thought I would mention since you aren't into paying big bucks for them. glasseshop.com, promo code FIRSTFREE
[06:28] <InHisName> That's how I got mine.  Several diff sites.   $8.99 shipping + free = <$10\
[06:28] <InHisName> Don't need any right now.
[06:29] <ChinnoDog> Your prescription must not be strong if you can get cheap ones. I am picky about my lenses because I can see chromatic distortion in high index mediums and it drives me up a wall.
[06:30] <InHisName> Say, ChinnoDog, do you know how to 'probe' in a script (bash) to tell if a drive is set to read only ?
[06:31] <ChinnoDog> No. Sorry, I am not that good at bash. :-(
[06:35] <InHisName> or ksh, or csh, or anyothershellyoucanname
[06:38] <Sadin> ChinnoDog what the heck is chromatic distortions
[06:41] <InHisName> color changes ?
[06:41] <Sadin> InHisName ah
[06:42] <Sadin> ive not the attention span to put two and two together atm lol
[06:42] <ChinnoDog> Sadin: It is when light of different frequencies is attenuated at different rates. I should have said "chromatic aberration". If you make lenses out of material with high chromatic aberration you see yellow and blue fringes around objects.
[06:42] <InHisName> errors in colors
[06:43] <Sadin> ChinnoDog THAT sounds pretty annoying
[06:43] <InHisName> VERY annoying if was in my eyeglasses.    Plasitic lenses are almost that way compared to real glass.
[06:43] <ChinnoDog> It is! when I was a teenager I purchased a pair of glasses from Lensecrafters with the new high index lenses they were pushing and I hated them for that reason.
[06:44] <Sadin> knock on wood, but im lucky to always have had perfect vision
[06:45] <Sadin> sigh... its good to be back to xfce
[06:45] <ChinnoDog> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_lens#Ophthalmic_material_property_tables
[06:45] <InHisName> lucky dog you, Sadin
[06:46] <Sadin> InHisName yeah im lucky yo have gotten my dads eyes my mom however is as blind as a bat.
[06:46] <Sadin> my dad and i, 20:20
[06:46] <Sadin> my mom is around 435:600ish
[06:46] <Sadin> its bad
[06:47] <ChinnoDog> As you can see on the chart plain glass has an abbe value around 57. Polycarbonate lenses have an abbe value of only 30.
[06:47] <InHisName> I used to be 20:825
[06:47] <InHisName> Now only 20:525
[06:48] <InHisName> Old age moves eyes to more farsighted.   So my glasses get lighter as I age.
[06:48] <ChinnoDog> My lenses are made of trivex with abbe value of 44. I couldn't find any online glasses places selling spectralite lenses or I would have considered them.
[06:49] <InHisName> Starts about 40 years.   Focus range stops being so wide and then you need 2 or even 3 pairs to see well at all distances.
[06:49] <ChinnoDog> :-(
[06:49] <ChinnoDog> Where is cloning technology when you need it?
[06:50] <InHisName> Coming along.
[06:50] <ChinnoDog> Maybe someone can grow me some new eyeballs one day
[06:51] <ChinnoDog> night vision upgrade and zoom lens wouldn't hurt either
[06:51] <InHisName> TV's hanging on wall like picture?   People laughed that we'd see that before 2000 back in '60's.   A bit late, but still great.
[06:52] <InHisName> The BORG has some nice technology.  Care to join up ?
[06:52] <ChinnoDog> Yes. They can prepare a nice ocular implant for me.
[06:52] <InHisName> I'll keep my poor eyesight and indepedance
[06:55] <ChinnoDog> Time to sleep
[06:55] <ChinnoDog> later
[06:55] <InHisName> g'nite
[11:31] <rmg51> Morning
=== rmg511 is now known as rmg51
[13:27] <waltman> Morning.
[13:54] <ChinnoDog> psh, morning
[13:54] <ChinnoDog> I was woken up to fix a web site at 8.
[13:56] <rmg51> poor ChinnoDog :'(
[13:56] <rmg51> I just got back from a 4 mile walk
[20:58] <roasted> hello!
[20:58] <roasted> Just ate myself into the most regretful food-coma ever.
[20:58] <roasted> pretty much hate myself right now
[21:00] <JonathanD> Hi.
[21:00] <JonathanD> Food is good.
[21:29] <roasted> still hating myself
[21:30] <roasted> why is subsonic so awesome
[22:23] <ChinnoDog> It is a conspiracy to make you go back for more.
[23:16] <JonathanD> subsonic?
