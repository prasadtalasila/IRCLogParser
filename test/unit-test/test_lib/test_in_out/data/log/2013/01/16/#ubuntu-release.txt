[01:21] <popey> hullo! bug 1100110
[01:21] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1100110 in xorg (Ubuntu) "can't upgrade xorg package" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100110
[01:22] <popey> i cant upgrade my xorg package in precise proposed
[01:33] <slangasek> popey: 1:7.6+12ubuntu1.12 doesn't appear to be an official version of the xserver-xorg package.  Isn't the problem that you have packages installed from an unofficial source?
[01:35] <popey> hmm.
[01:36] <popey> wonder where that came from
[01:36]  * popey rummages, thanks slangasek 
[01:36] <slangasek> beats me :)
[01:36] <slangasek> y/w
[09:03] <Mirv> precise queue's jockey (pre-requisite), nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates, nvidia-graphics-drivers-experimental, fglrx-installer-experimental-9 and fglrx-installer-updates would be nice to have so that we can test the LTS-Q stack as a whole also for the proprietary drivers
[09:04] <Mirv> now that the packages are finally in shape AFAIK
[09:05] <Mirv> (and I think bcmwl is also relevant although not a graphics driver - includes support for >3.4 kernels)

[10:13] <psivaa> cjwatson: infinity: I've had to report bug 1100213 for the precise d-i alternate and server installation failures this morning.
[10:13] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1100213 in debian-installer (Ubuntu) "Precise d-i installations fail with "/cdrom/dists/precise/main/debian-installer/binary-amd64/Packages does not exist" error" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100213
[10:15] <cjwatson> ack
[10:16] <cjwatson> though you misidentified the error message :)
[10:21] <psivaa> cjwatson: ohh again? :), syncing the image in progress slowly, so could not directly see what the issue was. took the error message from the logs
[10:24] <cjwatson> The correct error was in a slightly different place in the logs
[10:24] <cjwatson> it's just a kernel mismatch
[10:24] <cjwatson> i.e. muggins forgot to update the seeds
[10:25] <infinity> cjwatson: Oh, yeah, I was going to update the seeds when d-i was accepted.
[10:25] <cjwatson> I'll do it now
[10:25] <infinity> Which kinda happened, and then I forgot. :P
[10:26] <infinity> Thanks.
[10:27] <psivaa> thanks you, can i assume that all the impacted images would be re-spun?
[10:27] <cjwatson> I'll do ubuntu alt/server, anything else can be tomorrow's cron job
[10:28] <psivaa> ok thanks

[11:39] <Laney> Are the usb-* seeds still used for anything?
[11:39] <Laney> AFAICT they hold some stuff in main
[11:44] <xnox> Laney: there is also a funny dev seed that I want to kill.
[11:45] <tseliot> cjwatson: would it be possible to have bcmwl approved (the SRU for precise) by the end of this week? This would really be helpful for hwe
[11:45] <cjwatson> infinity: ^- could you do that?
[12:16] <Laney> xnox: yeah don't know about that one
[12:17] <Laney> also not sure if usb is holding stuff in main that we actually want there

[15:14] <scott-work> is this the appropriate place or -devel to mention that 386 image are not available for ubuntu studio precise ?
[15:16] <Riddell> in the ubuntu studio channel?
[15:55] <psivaa> out of curiosity, was there a bug involved in causing the precise desktop images to have been re-spun (i.e. 20130116.1)?
[15:56] <cjwatson> psivaa: New livecd-rootfs to try to fix size issues
[15:59] <psivaa> cjwatson: ahh ok, thanks
[15:59] <cjwatson> Hopefully, anyway, I haven't checked yet :)
[16:01] <psivaa> .OVERSIZED marks are still present in cdimage.u.c though
[16:05] <cjwatson> psivaa: Yeah, I wasn't expecting to get everything
[16:05] <cjwatson> It's death-by-a-thousand-cuts rather than a single problem
[16:07] <psivaa> cjwatson: ok :)

[16:11] <ogra_> stop caring, its healthy :)
[16:12] <cjwatson> We've stopped caring for *later* releases ;-)

[16:43] <slangasek> infinity, cjwatson: any idea on the current precise zh_CN build failures?  I'm not sure why it's complaining about xserver-xorg-lts-quantal; it's true that this is only in -proposed so wouldn't be in the sources.list when rebuilding, but shouldn't it already be in the image?
[16:45] <cjwatson> I was thinking about ignoring it until we decide we can blat xorg into -updates - I suspect ubuntu-defaults-image isn't very good at handling -proposed
[17:11] <Riddell> anyone remember rejecting ksnakeduel and kmahjongg?
[17:12] <Riddell> the new transitional binaries were rejected but I got nobody telling me why
[17:21] <scott-work> Riddell: it is the developers from the ubuntustudio-devel channel than are asking about the images that are not being created
[17:29] <Riddell> scott-work: have they looked at the logs?
[17:30] <slangasek> it's being discussed on ubuntu-release@
[17:40] <scott-work> Riddell: to be honest, i had forgotten where the logs were at. i have them now. thank you for reminding me.
[17:41] <scott-work> slangasek: i see the email now. it was in an unexpected folder because of who is was addressed.
[17:41] <scott-work> thank you both

[20:51] <cjwatson> SpamapS: ^-
[20:52] <cjwatson> was bitten by me forgetting to rm .upload when re-uploading with infinity's correction to the default/grub.d bits
[20:52] <SpamapS> cjwatson: thats what you get for using dput ;)
[20:52] <SpamapS> cjwatson: will review shortly, thanks
[20:53] <cjwatson> pretty sure dupload had similar behaviour, only worse (it used to produce partial reuploads if you'd interrupted a previous one, which was not too terrible with Debian's upload queue but pathologically bad with Ubuntu's)
