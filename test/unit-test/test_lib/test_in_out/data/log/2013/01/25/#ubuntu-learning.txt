[18:06] <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2: hey, do you think the learning materials may be ready for late march? my teacher said they can teach Ubuntu at my school if they get the materials
[18:07] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: we haven't even gotten the first trial class done :(
[18:07] <pleia2> so I doubt it
[18:07] <pleia2> hopefully will have the first demo one done by early feburary though
[18:08] <JoseeAntonioR> ok, let me know so I can start working on that too :)
[18:08] <JoseeAntonioR> I'll see if I can present it this year so they'll teach it next year
[18:08] <pleia2> yep, we'll announce it on list when it's ready :)
