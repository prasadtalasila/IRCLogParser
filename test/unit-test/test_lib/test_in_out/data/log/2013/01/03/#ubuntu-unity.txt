[10:55] <mhr3> davidcalle, hey there
[10:55] <mhr3> how was the holiday?
[10:55] <davidcalle> mhr3, nice holidays?
[10:55] <davidcalle> mhr3, pretty good, thanks!

[10:59] <davidcalle> mhr3, I think I've missed your answer
[11:08] <Klap-in> davidcalle: nothing is said after your 'mhr3, pretty good, thanks!'
[11:09] <davidcalle> Klap-in, ty :)
[11:09] <mhr3> davidcalle, sorry, was on a call
[11:09] <davidcalle> np
[11:10] <mhr3> davidcalle, so yea, it was great, got some rest, spent time with family... usual xmas stuff :)
[11:10] <mhr3> and ate a lot :)
[11:11] <davidcalle> mhr3, sounds nice :)
[11:32] <mhr3> davidcalle, so what's new with you?
[11:32] <mhr3> how many scopes do we have? :)
=== mmrazik is now known as mmrazik|afk
[11:34] <davidcalle> mhr3, we are at 7. I'm concentrating on the "useful" ones to start: reddit, wikipedia, google news, yahoo stock, grooveshark, imdb, wordnik
[11:36] <davidcalle> mhr3, I'm eagerly waiting for the Dash to get updated, to have a real feel of how it will fall down.
[11:37] <davidcalle> s/down/in place
[11:38] <mhr3> we'll get there :)
[11:39] <davidcalle> mhr3, by the way, with some master scopes code in place, is there a way for me to try it? To have libunity pick up the .scope files?
[11:40] <mhr3> i didn't try it on a real system, but the unit tests show that it should work
[11:41] <mhr3> davidcalle, if you have master m1.scope file (master scope), put it somewhere in xyz/unity/scopes
[11:42] <mhr3> put its child .scope files in xyz/unity/scopes/m1/
[11:42] <mhr3> and then run the master scope daemon with XDG_DATA_DIRS set to xyz
[11:42] <mhr3> of course the child scopes have to be dbus-activatable
[11:43] <davidcalle> mhr3, interesting, I'll give it a try in a moment
[11:44] <mhr3> (...dbus-activatable or running already)
[11:45] <davidcalle> mhr3, yeah, I figured
[11:47] <davidcalle> mhr3, feedback on this later today. Lunch time, ttyl

[16:09] <davidcalle> mhr3, no luck with setting up a working master scope, I'll try again later, it's not very important for me atm.
[16:10] <mhr3> davidcalle, hmm, can you share somehow how you tried to do it
[16:15] <davidcalle> mhr3, one process for the master scope, where I just create and export it, declared as a master in its .scope file. Then two other scope files in something/unity/scopes/<master>. I run the master and the two scopes. I set XDG_DATA_DIRS to something and run libunity-tool.
[16:16] <davidcalle> mhr3, is there a ismaster prop I should set in the process too?
[16:18] <davidcalle> mhr3, if I try to do it I have a warning : Warning: g_object_set_property: construct property "is-master" for object `UnityScope' can't be set after construction  self.scope.props.is_master = True
=== gatox is now known as gatox_lunch
[16:24] <mhr3> davidcalle, master scopes are initialized using Unity.MasterScope (...)
[16:25] <mhr3> kinda forgot to mention that tiny detail :)
[16:25] <davidcalle> mhr3, " No sub-scopes directory found for master scope reference.scope" Yay, much better, now I'm setting it up again :)
