[06:14] <zequence> morning
[07:59] <astraljava> Hey zequence, how's Monday treating ya thus far?
[12:56] <zequence-w> astraljava: Hi :). Been busy all morning, so I guess I haven't had the time to think about it yet
[12:57] <zequence-w> I like Mondays. Even though, I would have preferred to have it postponed as I was busy with something else yesterday
[13:13] <astraljava> Yeah. I'm kinda in the middle of something as well, so I'm thinking I'll leave early and finish what I started. Kinda have to, cause some of it has deadlines tomorrow anyway.
[14:35] <scott-work> good morning everyone
[14:45] <len-1304> good morning
[14:47] <len-1304> micahg, when you read this, both -settings and -icon-theme need uploading/releasing
[14:48] <len-1304> micahg, icon-theme had a spelling error in it
[14:56] <scott-work> len-1304: i feel bad for not doing the -release team report and want to submit a late one, is there anything memorable you can mention to me to add?
[14:56] <scott-work> i know zequence has been working on the kernel, you have done worked on the icons
[14:57] <scott-work> is there anything in particular you would mention for the -settings changes and other theming aspects?
[15:02] <len-1304> still in progress pending testing.
[15:03] <len-1304> The install Icon is correct if our icon theme is chosen. but is not by default yet. 
[15:03] <len-1304> When the new settings is released it will be.
[15:05] <len-1304> We have added zita-ajbridge, a high quality replacement for alsa-in
[15:06] <len-1304> When we added kdenlive we got k3b as well
[15:06] <len-1304> I'm not a video guy and so I have not tested kdenlive
[15:07] <len-1304> Gotta run bye now
[15:07] <micahg> len-1304: ok, will do
[17:03] <scott-work> len-1304: kdenlive really is a good video editor
[19:19] <scott-work> hi ttoine
[19:40] <ttoine> hi scott-work 
[19:41] <ttoine> scott-work, I build a ubuntu studio workstation this week for a small studio in my area
[19:42] <ttoine> because of the problem of  Mixbus / cairo / nvidia driver, we are building a full amd workstation
[19:42] <ttoine> intel is too expensive for the same power...
[19:43] <ttoine> I hope it will be possible to make a kind of white paper case
[20:32] <zequence> ttoine: ATI graphic card?
[20:33] <zequence> The free drivers for ATI are fully functional, but have a tendency to cause overheating
[20:33] <zequence> The proprietary drivers only work for 12.04
[20:33] <zequence> Intel graphics are the best choice for studio setups IMO
[20:34] <ttoine> zequence, i agree with you
[20:34] <ttoine> but for the same performance, it is 150 â‚¬ more...
[20:35] <ttoine> zequence, and I am seriously considering using a 12.04 lts, because harrison mixbus and linux dsp are working on this one too
[20:35] <zequence> AMD has had problems with performance with their processors. Even with many cores and a high frequency, depending on the job, they don't do well compared to Intel
[20:36] <ttoine> zequence, well, it depends. For high level computing, AMD is prefered than Intel
[20:36] <ttoine> and a lot of gamers and overclocking specialists use amd
[20:37] <ttoine> a good point for AMD is that they package their CPU with more quit fans
[20:37] <zequence> A new fan is cheap though
[20:37] <zequence> The power supply is a different story :)
[20:37] <ttoine> yes
[20:38] <ttoine> a good oversized antec  ;-)
[20:38] <scott-work> ttoine: i would be very interested in reading such a white paper
[20:41] <zequence> Just got my own subdomain for the Linux course I'm holding. Not much up yet, but hoping it'll lead to some work :). http://linux.itlyftet.se/
[20:41] <zequence> Already, I've made a few people use Ubuntu over Windows at the place where I'm holding the course
[20:42] <ttoine> zequence, wich wootheme is it ?
[20:42] <ttoine> nevermind, i can find it myself
[20:42] <zequence> ttoine: Inspire
[20:44] <scott-work> zequence: congratulations. that must make you feel good
[20:44] <zequence> scott-work: It doesn't feel like work, you know
[20:45] <ttoine> zequence, I understand you... it is always a great feeling to teach a passion
