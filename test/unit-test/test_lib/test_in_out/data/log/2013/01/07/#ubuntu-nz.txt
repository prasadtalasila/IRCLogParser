[00:59] <snail> ibeardslee: how did the first session go?
[01:00] <ibeardslee> goodly .. mostly
[01:01] <ibeardslee> couple of bits of fun and games .. ubuntu installing the bootloader onto the USB flash drive instead of the HD
[01:03] <ibeardslee> office lan vs wireless lan
[01:03] <ibeardslee> but all seemed to go well
[01:26] <snail> how's the gender ratio this year? any bi-linguals we can collar for translation duties?
[01:32] <ibeardslee> 10F/10M
[01:33] <ibeardslee> none of them seemed to make it obvious (was one last year).
[01:39] <snail> 10/10 is great. was that deliberate?
[01:40] <ojwb> just say "good luck" in maori as they leave...
[02:18] <ibeardslee> snail: nope not an accident, just how the numbers fell. Of course helped that one of the local girls schools is quite supportive
[02:20] <ibeardslee> ... wait .. .. nope, it WAS an accident ..
[02:20] <ibeardslee> sigh
[02:20] <ajmitch> mondays... :)
