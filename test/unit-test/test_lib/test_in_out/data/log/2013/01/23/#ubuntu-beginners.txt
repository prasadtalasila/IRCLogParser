[12:19] <aged> what amount of memory would you reccomend for 11 10 in vbox please
[13:35] <histo> aged: 1024 or so....  You can go lower if you want. I think the minimums are rather low for 11.10
[17:01] <pip__> Hello.  I've managed to install AMDs13.1 drivers & Catalyst Control Centre in Quantal but cannot find the Overdrive tab so I can check my temp & fan speeds.  Is there something I need to enable or some other weirdness?
[17:05] <holstein> pip__: is there a problem?
[17:05] <holstein> if they didnt include the app, then it wont be there
[17:06] <pip__> I'm not sure yet, I'd just like to keep an eye on the fan speed, my 4870 was running REALLY loud until it popped a few days ago
[17:07] <pip__> I WILL NOT be overclocking the new card or anything
[17:09] <holstein> pip__: there are other tools for checking
[17:09] <holstein> even in the bios, which is not ideal... i usually just check when im worried... any app like that has overhead, though it might not be much... i paid $8US for my graphics card though
[17:11] <pip__> ok.  I've installed a 7870, so I'd like to keep an eye on it.  Sensors tells me the temp is good though
[17:12] <pip__> I found it odd that the Linux CCC didn't have the overdrive tab
[17:16] <pip__> What is a decent tool to monitor the fan speeds with?
[17:16] <pip__> please
[17:16] <holstein> pip__: any of the applets, that i have not tried since gnome2
[17:17] <pip__> haha, same here
[17:17] <holstein> anything from the repos should work, assuming the device is passing it out
[17:18] <pip__> I think it must be as I get a reading in W7
[17:18] <holstein> pip__: no doubt that functionality *can* be supplied to you
[17:19] <holstein> pip__: you cannot ever compare driver support or hardware support, or end-user experience from windows
[17:19] <pip__> perhaps I should rerun sensors-detect?
[17:20] <pip__> true.  I was kinda hoping that the GPU has the ability to supply the data, I guess it's making that actually happen
[17:22] <pip__> anyhoo - dinner. Thanks for the help again holstein
