[06:51] <jam> james_w: when you're around, I have some questions about lp:~james_w/charms/precise/tarmac
[12:08] <vila> mgz: ping
[12:08] <vila> mgz: I commented on bug #11011320 , can't reproduce unless I specify --no-plugins which... is expected since the lp: resolving is done by the launchpad plugin
[12:08] <ubot5> Error: Launchpad bug 11011320 could not be found
[12:09] <vila> yeah, bug #1101320 easy tyop to detect no ?
[12:09] <ubot5> bug 1101320 in Bazaar "Using bzr config with --directory and --scope fails with lp: url " [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1101320
[12:10] <vila> mgz: so my memory was to blame last time I said "Oh, this command doesn't resolve", it does resolve indeed
[12:14] <mgz> hm, I'm reasonably sure I tested with 2.6b2, but what I have here right now is 2.5.1 apparent
[12:14] <mgz> lyu
[12:16] <fullermd> Shoot, we've all been working for years to find a programmatic way to correct your tpyos   :p
[12:17] <jelmer> surely there aren't that many ways you can have typos in the word 'typos'
[12:18] <vila> tyoppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp damn cat !
[12:18] <fullermd> "Oh, look," says vila, "a challenge!"
[12:20] <jelmer> you have trained your cat well, if he can get that close to spelling "typos"
[12:20] <vila> virtual cats are very smart ;)
[12:21] <vila> ...and don't let my daughters ever know I pretended to have a cat ;)
[12:21] <mgz> vila: completely fresh quantal machine

[12:26] <vila> bingo !
[12:26] <fullermd> It's probably just one of those weird ambiguities of en   ;p
[12:26] <mgz> there we go, that's why I asked you the other day, I thought it rang a bell :)
[12:26] <vila> spaking of bingo, Christoph Walz is even better in Djan unchained ;)
[12:26] <vila> mgz: yeah, but neurons are a bit confused about which bugs were fixed...
[12:26] <vila> *speaking
[12:27] <vila> *Django (wich a slient D)
[12:27] <vila> *silent
[12:27] <vila> gee, I'm at my best...
[12:29] <vila> fullermd: I know... but my fear is that this bug is gonna be a pain to fix :-/ And I've yet to find a couple of hours to confirm that...
[12:30] <fullermd> Well, sure.  If it _wasn't_ going to be a pain, I'd have bugged someone else   ;p
[12:30] <vila> hehe
[12:31] <fullermd> I've discovered it's a self-reinforcing bug, though.  It's been there for _years_, and apparently nobody ever noticed when it bit them (or at least, didn't characterize and report it)
[12:31] <vila> mgz: so, fix is in 2.5.2 and bzr.dev only
[12:31] <fullermd> But I've had at least 2 incidents in just the couple months since I winnowed it out, where it's gotten in my way.
[12:31] <vila> fullermd: urgh, so indeed, will be be a pain ;-/
[12:32] <fullermd> So my theory is that it happens exponentially more often the more I talk about it.
[12:32] <vila> ban fullermd with prejudice
[12:32] <vila> rats, fail
[12:32] <fullermd> Now I just need to get that bot finished...
[12:33] <vila> mgz: time for 2.6b3 ? ;-D
[12:34] <mgz> just trying to confirm the fix...
[12:34] <vila> mgz: ooooh, there is a test for it ;)
[13:01] <Stavros> hello
[13:01] <Stavros> is bzr-git unmaintained?
[13:04] <Stavros> jelmer: you wrote it, didn't you?
[13:05] <jelmer> Stavros: yes, but I'm no longer working on it
[13:05] <Stavros> oh, why not?
[13:05] <jelmer> that doesn't necessarily mean it's dead, though I don't think there have been many other contributions since
[13:05] <Stavros> hm
[13:05] <jelmer> Stavros: moved on to other things
[13:05] <Stavros> too bad, it's a very important plugin
[13:06] <Stavros> it allows me to use bzr regardless of what others use :/
[13:06] <Stavros> git's porcelain is driving me insane, bzr is the sanest dvcs i know
[13:06] <jelmer> it's not going anywhere, the code is still there
[13:06] <Stavros> jelmer: yeah, but i can't push because of the gpgsig bug
[13:07] <Stavros> read: i can't use the work repo with bzr
[13:07] <Stavros> that's too bad

[19:59] <jdahlin> It seems that there are an issue related to renames in bzr fastimport, are there any good alternatives to fastimport when I'd like to export a bzr repository?
[20:39] <LarstiQ> jdahlin: export in what sense? There is `bzr export`, but that doesn't sound like what you're after
