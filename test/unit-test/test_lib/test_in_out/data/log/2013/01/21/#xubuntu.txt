[00:27] <synfulz> Hey all, I had a quick question..I bought an old sx260 to mess around with, I have Lubuntu on it right now (which runs smoothly for bare bones) and was wondering if Xubuntu would be a better setup? (sorry for the TLDR, couldn't find min specs on the site)
[01:06] <john_rambo> I was trying another distro & modified the swap partition. The installation didnt succeed so I rebooted. Xubuntu booted fine but now I am worried if Xubuntu is using swap. How to find out ?

[15:34] <iKrzysiek> I have a question
[15:34] <iKrzysiek> i deleted lightdm
[15:34] <iKrzysiek> sudo apt-get remove lightdm
[15:34] <iKrzysiek> and now system is stopping at the loading bar
[15:34] <iKrzysiek> at startup
[15:34] <iKrzysiek> How can I fix it/install lightdm?
[15:39] <TheSheep> iKrzysiek: boot into recovery and apt-get install it
[15:40] <iKrzysiek> how to boot into recovery?
[15:43] <TheSheep> iKrzysiek: hold down shift while booting, then select it from the menu

[18:31] <xubuntu816> hello
[18:39] <aperson> something is preventing me from assigning super+space as a keyboard shortcut (I like to have my drop down terminal launched with that).  Is there a way to figure out why I can't use this combination?
[18:40] <recon_lap> aperson: dont know, could something be using it already.
[18:41] <aperson> it's not bound to anything that I know of, I can use yakuquake fine with that keybind
[18:41] <aperson> it's just xfce's keyboard shortcuts that are having problems with it

[20:25] <NickRivers> Hello, I'm trying to open a specific folder from the bottom bar in 12.10, but it only opens the /home folder. How would I fix that?
[20:26] <kgb> panel preferences, items
[20:26] <well_laid_lawn> you made a launcher? should be thunar /path/to/folder
[20:27] <NickRivers> I switched to nautilus... coukld be the problem...?
[20:28] <NickRivers> No launcher made
[20:31] <kgb> yeah, but help doesn't have it :f http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/directorymenu
[20:33] <kgb> unless the plugin IS thunar and you need a different one for Nautilus, that might make sense
[20:37] <NickRivers> I made some changes to /user/.config/user-dirs.dirs to get the Templates folder to work, could it be that?
[20:38] <well_laid_lawn> xdg-preffered-apps might let you change to nautilus
[20:42] <NickRivers> Nautilus is selected, but it doesn't take me to the folder I choose
[20:45] <well_laid_lawn> I did say 'might'
[20:45] <well_laid_lawn> ;)
[20:46] <NickRivers> lol
[20:53] <NickRivers>  Well, rebooting... Thanks
