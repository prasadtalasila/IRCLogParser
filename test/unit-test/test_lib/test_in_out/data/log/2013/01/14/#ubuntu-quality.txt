[07:48] <jibel> good morning
[07:48] <pitti> bonjour jibel
[08:31] <zyga> good morning
[10:20] <jibel> rbasak, hey, you might be interested by r142 of auto-package-testing. I extended the option -S to support various schemes to fetch source packages, amongst which loading the source package from a local directory.
[10:21] <rbasak> jibel: oooh, thank you!
[10:22] <rbasak> jibel: that will also build the source package and test the built package, right?
[10:22] <jibel> rbasak, right, it should
[10:22] <rbasak> OK

[18:12] <balloons> hmm.. autopilot seems to get confused if my app launches a new window
[18:12] <balloons> alesage, you about?
[18:13] <alesage> hi balloons
[18:13] <balloons> hello.. have you encountered this before? Maybe I should just point you to the test to run
[18:13] <alesage> balloons, yes please do
[18:13] <balloons> alesage, http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-testcase/ubuntu-autopilot-tests/trunk/view/head:/screenshot/test_screenshot.py
[18:14] <balloons> that's a little older, but the problem is the same.. after taking the screenshot, the main window is hidden and the "save File" window appears.. this seems to confuse autopilot (or just me :-))
[18:14] <alesage> balloons, when you say 'confuse' what do you mean?
[18:15] <balloons> i mean I get BadWindow: <class 'Xlib.error.BadWindow'>: code = 3, resource_id = Xlib.xobject.resource.Resource(0x04e00003), sequence_number = 18, major_opcode = 20, minor_opcode = 0
[18:15] <balloons> things like that :-(
[18:15] <alesage> balloons, hmpf
[18:15] <balloons> this may be a mute point, as if I roll to introspection I won't be using bmaf
[18:15] <balloons> *bamf
[18:15] <alesage> balloons, result of this will probably be a bug, willing to fill out?
[18:16] <balloons> alesage, ofc
[18:16] <balloons> autopilot run screenshot.test_screenshot.ScreenshotTests.test_whole_screen
[18:16] <balloons> run that and you should see the same thing
[18:18] <alesage> balloons, need to context-switch :) , might need your help getting set up with your suite
[18:18] <balloons> ahh
[18:19] <balloons> you could simply pull the branch
[18:19] <balloons> bzr branch lp:ubuntu-autopilot-tests
[18:19] <alesage> ok balloons
[18:20] <balloons> so I learned bzr doesn't commit whitespace only changes it seems
[18:26] <alesage> ok balloons I'm able to reproduce this
[18:29] <balloons> excellent
[18:32] <alesage> balloons, definitely feels like a bamf thing, thomi will want to have a look--I'm not as familiar with this part of the code
[18:33] <balloons> ok, anything else you need from me?
[18:33] <alesage> no balloons :)
[18:34] <balloons> :-)

[19:56] <Noskcaj> is anyone (other than letozaf_) able to work on bug 1087409 while i'm gone? try and get some logs etc. ideally using a slower machine as the problem is more pronounced
[19:56] <ubot5> bug 1087409 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "*buntu dailys take 3 minutes to get to the next screen if install mp3 is selected." [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1087409
[19:59] <balloons> Noskcaj, do you have a log from this?
[19:59] <balloons> is it still happening?
[19:59] <balloons> have to rule out network lag
[19:59] <balloons> or apt weirdness
[20:00] <Noskcaj> still happening, it's been at least 5 mins in this kubuntu install. the bug seems to affect both with and without an iternet connection
[20:00] <letozaf_> Noskcaj, maybe I can try to reproduce your bug putting less RAM on my VM, how much RAM do you have ?
[20:00] <Noskcaj> i will double check if i have time
[20:00] <balloons> ok, something funny in apt perhaps
[20:00] <balloons> the logs would tell us
[20:00] <balloons> get the install log and post
[20:00] <Noskcaj> letozaf_, 1gb, via testdrive
[20:01] <letozaf_> Noskcaj, oh! so makes no sense also my VM has 1GB :(
[20:01] <Noskcaj> balloons, not going to have time, as soon as my family wakes up (its 7am) i have to go
[20:01] <balloons> I cam test real hw, but tiniest box has 4 gig of ram
[20:01] <balloons> I could go pull sticks I guess, but I'd prefer to see the log first :-)
[20:06] <Noskcaj> something broke in kubuntu because of bug 1066225

[20:14] <SergioMeneses> phillw, solved thanks!
[20:15] <phillw> SergioMeneses: okies, sorry, mondays are afk days for me. But I do catch up on pings :)
[20:15] <SergioMeneses> ok :)
[21:06] <balloons> alesage, thomi ok, so question for you two.. I'd like to package up the tests from the autopilot project we've got going.. what's the best way to do so?
[21:06] <balloons> my intent for packaging is to have others easily run the tests
[21:07] <alesage> balloons, excellent idea
[21:07] <alesage> balloons, what part of the packaging are you needing help with?
[21:08] <alesage> also note that thomi is out of the office for a couple of days, I believe
[21:08] <balloons> just wondering what's the best way to package them up
[21:08] <balloons> I could just go look at autopilot unity I guess
[21:09] <alesage> balloons, ya I'm actually quite n00bish with packaging, myself
[21:10] <balloons> alesage, ty.. ok, I'll probably snag a look at unity package
[21:11] <Noskcaj> should we add to the classroom session a link to this https://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/185-jennifer-cloer/689432-learn-linux-from-the-experts-live-linux-qaa-january-16
[21:13] <balloons> Noskcaj, add to what exactly?
[21:14] <Noskcaj> idk, just telling people it's happening. found it on twitter
[21:20] <Noskcaj>  balloons, are there any testcases for xubuntu that need writing (i could make them autotestcases afterwards)? also, should we have a steam for linux testcase?
[21:20] <balloons> Noskcaj, we could
[21:21] <balloons> Noskcaj, xubuntu i would think could use tests for there default apps
[21:21] <balloons> leafpad, xfce panel stuff.. abiword, gnumeric
[21:21] <balloons> what else do they use?
[21:21] <Noskcaj> i'm thinking maybe a transmission testcase first, i use it a fair bit. and it's ubuntu as well
[21:21] <balloons> perfect
[21:23] <Noskcaj> a quick list: catfish, galculator, gnome mplayer (i think, i installed then partly uninstalled lubuntu-desktop
[21:25] <balloons> Noskcaj, ok, should put those suggestions down
[21:25] <balloons> then ping the list and see who all is interested
[21:25] <Noskcaj> ok, i have to leave in ~1 hour so i will do that stuff while i'm in brisbane
[21:32] <balloons> sounds good!
