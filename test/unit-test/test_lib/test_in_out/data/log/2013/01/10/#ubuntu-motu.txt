[00:11] <xnox> lfaraone: my mental response is "do _not_ let me know how that works out for you" i hear enough whining as it is =))))
[00:15] <ajmitch> xnox: you don't like being blackmailed? :)
[04:46] <micahg> hyperair: can I assume when you mention looking into Diodon, that's to push to Debian?
[04:51] <hyperair> micahg: no, i meant for Ubuntu.
[04:51] <micahg> hyperair: would you mind pushing to Debian instead?
[04:51] <hyperair> micahg: i wouldn't mind, but are the build-deps satisfied?
[04:52] <hyperair> micahg: afaik that's the main issue, isn't it?
[04:52] <hyperair> diodon is primarily an indicator these days
[04:54] <micahg> ah, right, lacking unity
[05:01] <hyperair> micahg: i'll try looking into it. with a few patches i think it can make do with just the application indicator, which should work in Debian, i think.
[05:02] <hyperair> i recall enabling indicator support for alarm-clock-applet on Debian, and immediately got bug reports complaining about left click behaviour not working.
[05:02] <micahg> hyperair: ok, I thought it might be pushable as is, in this case, it makes sense to go into Ubuntu first and into Debian as time permits I think (but if it's really easy, why not :))
[05:03] <hyperair> micahg: well the part that depends on unity is the diodon lens.
[05:03] <hyperair> it might be possible to just exclude that
[05:03] <micahg> ah, if it was a configure option, that would be nice :)
[05:04] <hyperair> mmhm.
[05:05] <hyperair> but diodon's python if i'm not mistaken, so maybe it's a setup.py thign.
[05:05] <hyperair> no, it's native.
[05:05] <hyperair> okay, configure then. that'll be considerably easier to handle :-)

[19:13] <alo21> micahg, hi
[19:13] <alo21> hi everybody.
[19:15] <alo21> micahg, What should I answer to this comment: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/util-linux/+bug/1095521/comments/4
[19:15] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1095521 in util-linux (Ubuntu) "Manpage for mount list different options in same paragraph (keybits, nofail, iversion)" [Medium,In progress]

[22:09] <alo21> hi
[22:10] <alo21> I am fixing bug LP: #1095521
[22:10] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1095521 in util-linux (Ubuntu) "Manpage for mount list different options in same paragraph (keybits, nofail, iversion)" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1095521
[22:11] <alo21> and the same bug was reported in debian, which has a patch. What should I do? Wait for a coming merge, or pick the patch in debian and attach it in LP?
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[22:35] <micahg> alo21: if it's important to have for this release and a Debian upload isn't coming soon, we can upload the fix to Ubuntu (you take the Debian patch and add a changelog entry)
[22:35] <micahg> otherwise, wait for a Debian update and the last person to touch it should merge it (or you can ask them if you can merge it)
[22:39] <blkperl> Hi everyone, first time MOTU contributer, my branch has been sitting in the sponser queue for a while now, can someone take a look and give me some feedback? :)
[22:42] <p0s> blkperl: in general, on all channels on irc, asking whether you can ask does not make sense, nobody will answer that. just specify your full question right away and wait some time
[22:42] <jtaylor> the branch link would be helpful
[22:44] <blkperl> link is here https://code.launchpad.net/~blkperl/ubuntu/raring/collectd/merge-from-debian
[22:48] <blkperl> p0s: I was asking for feedback, not asking if I could ask a question but next time I'll leave out the background info and skip to the question
[22:49] <p0s> blkperl: yes you were asking for feedback but not providing the full information to give you the feedback
[22:49] <Laney> it's fine
[22:49] <p0s> blkperl: as jtaylor pointed out, the branch link would be helpful
[22:49] <Laney> no need to rag on him
[22:49]  * blkperl assumed you would search for blkperl in the sponser queue....
[22:49] <p0s> Laney, blkperl: just trying to give general advice on getting questions answered on irc, no insult :)
[22:50] <jtaylor> I'm lazy, clicking a link is easier than searching for my bookmark :/
[22:51]  * jtaylor needs dash search for bookmarks (in opera)
[22:54] <alo21> micahg, hhmmm.... as the last comment says in the bug report in LP, I sent the patch upstream. How should I set the bug?
[22:56] <micahg> alo21: triaged
[22:57] <alo21> micahg, and assignee it to nobody. right?
[22:58] <micahg> alo21: yeah
[22:59] <alo21> thanks
[23:00] <micahg> alo21: you might want to keep an eye on it if you want the change in raring
[23:01] <alo21> micahg, hhmmm. OK
[23:04] <alo21> micahg, but I think I have to test the patch. The problem is that the package has format 1.0
[23:05] <micahg> alo21: so, it should be an inline patch anyways, just apply it and make a new source package
[23:06] <alo21> micahg, this is the patch: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=21;filename=0001-util-linux-ffix-697881.patch;att=1;bug=697881
