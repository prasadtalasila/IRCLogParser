[00:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> ydrive P/word (I've only NAS and dropbox), and Xbox (After I bought this baby:: http://goo.gl/BXY3C /Why/ would I want to join the club ?) .. the vidz a bit old; Dec 28th '12 but he shows how thorny the set-up is .. when will I see the set-up stage process of the Üphone on youtu.be ??
[00:34] <directhex> solarcloud_3scrn, it wants me to install a spotify app, but there's no spotify app available
[00:35] <directhex> solarcloud_3scrn, and the lumia 810 and 822 are US carrier specific, the 820 is the global version

[11:26] <codecowboy> hi. anyone know why i can to do an openssl connect from the command line in an ubuntu vm except when I have a vpn connection open (on the VM)? the target is internet accessible.
[11:27] <dwatkins> 'XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with high compression ratio. XZ Utils were written for POSIX-like systems, but also work on some not-so-POSIX systems. XZ Utils are the successor to LZMA Utils.'
[11:27] <MartijnVdS> codecowboy: openssl s_client -host X -port Y
[11:27] <MartijnVdS> codecowboy: openssl s_client --help for more :)
[11:28] <codecowboy> MartijnVdS thanks that doesn't answer my question. I know how to connect, I'm asking for advice / insight as to why it does't connect under certain conditions.
[11:29] <MartijnVdS> codecowboy: in that case, check your routes
[11:29] <MartijnVdS> codecowboy: the VPN might be messing with your default route
[11:29] <MartijnVdS> codecowboy: ip route show
[11:30] <codecowboy> MartijnVdS cool, thanks
[11:30] <MartijnVdS> codecowboy: traceroute/mtr should show you if this is the problem as well, I think

[17:52] <SuperEngineer> boo!
[17:54] <SuperEngineer> just reserved a [minor] upgrade to current desktop - a real bare metal pc - no pre-installed op sys
[17:55] <penguin42> which one?
[17:55] <SuperEngineer> http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/5074354.htm
[17:55] <penguin42> ah yeh, one of the zoostorms
[17:56] <penguin42> SuperEngineer: I got one of the other zoostorms for my dad (from ebuyer) - worked ok, not that quiet a psu, but not too bad
[17:56] <SuperEngineer> penguin42: good news.
[17:57] <SuperEngineer> [though I suspect many here will say "...& that's an upgrade?" in my case  ;)
[17:58] <SuperEngineer> ..& if fans are too loud - I'll work out a way to muzzle them I hope
[18:01] <rena5192> Hello guys, I am from Brazil, and I am living in Europe at the moment. I would like to know what is the most famous events about IT in Europe, do you know about it? In Brazil we have Campus Party in SP, really cool.
[18:04] <SuperEngineer> rena5192: if you're available to travel to UK - OggCamp - assuming you're into open source
[18:04] <solarcloud_3scrn> rena5192, https://fosdem.org/
[18:04] <rena5192> Yes, I live in UK. :)
[18:05] <rena5192> Thank you, I will take a look about OggCamp
[18:05] <popey> rena5192: also look at UKUUG events
[18:05] <rena5192> and thank you Solar I will check this website
[18:05] <rena5192> that's great
[18:05] <rena5192> Thank you Popey
[18:05] <SuperEngineer> popey: ;)
[18:06] <solarcloud_3scrn> rena5192, Both are cold, but at least at fosdem .. all you pay is the airfare to Brussels  .. couchsurf the rest.
[18:07] <solarcloud_3scrn> I done fosdem many times over.
[18:07] <rena5192> Really cool
[18:08] <rena5192> I was looking for Campus Pary in Spain, but I think is not so famous like in Brazil.
[18:09] <solarcloud_3scrn> video/s on youtube .. also the couchsurfing group (ask this week to get a free bed) .. also a lot of people will speak your language/s.
[18:09] <rena5192> cool
[18:10] <rena5192> thank you very much, I really appreciate it
[18:10] <solarcloud_3scrn> Probably will be very cold .. so expect to wrap up.
[18:10] <rena5192> lol, that's fine, I prefer cold weather :)
[18:11] <rena5192> 25 years living in Brazil.. around 35 degrees...
[18:12] <SuperEngineer> rena5192: the only "35" we get here at the moment is 35 inches of rain
[18:12] <solarcloud_3scrn> Expect -2 celcius.
[18:12] <rena5192> Great :)
[18:17] <SuperEngineer> popey: have reserved one of those zoostorms you retweeted. cheap enough to take the risk - risk because nowhere states full or m/b spec or uefi etc... do I care - nah! thanks for the info
[18:29] <solarcloud_3scrn> SuperEngineer, I have zoostorms all over my ebay saved searches .. AFAs the service .. it's an american company as I have researched them; and ebay.co.uk is littered with plenty of PC-boxes that are overpriced, outdated and v. poor service. In my 3 years of getting daily emails from zoostorm/ebay.co.uk
[18:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> poor service .. in my 3
[18:31] <solarcloud_3scrn> rena didn't stay long .. it seems this #channel didn't suit optimistic ppl.
[18:32] <solarcloud_3scrn> at large....
[18:32] <penguin42> solarcloud_3scrn: Really? I thought they were Liverpool based
[18:33] <penguin42> solarcloud_3scrn: I mailed them after the one I bought from ebuyer was missing a serial port (which they said was ebuyers fault because they didn't think it should have one) and got a reply from a 'cms-computers.co.uk'
[18:36] <SuperEngineer> solarcloud_3scrn: this is why I was tempted by it being avaialble from argos... uk statutory if "not fit for purpose" applies.
[18:37] <solarcloud_3scrn> It's acommon mistake with zoosorm , but they are actually a NewYork company with a Liverpoul front. Be under no illusions they are not a British company .. all the loot goes back to the Yanks in Americae. Steer-clear my friend.
[18:37] <solarcloud_3scrn> **zoostorm
[18:38] <penguin42> solarcloud_3scrn: Why does it matter if they have a liverpool front?
[18:38] <solarcloud_3scrn> service is not up o UK standard.
[18:38] <solarcloud_3scrn> **up to
[18:38] <penguin42> I've not seen any good UK service for a machine like that
[18:38] <SuperEngineer> solarcloud_3scrn: the loot in this case goes via Argos UK to them... me not affected by where they are based
[18:38] <solarcloud_3scrn> aria pc .. try there.
[18:38] <penguin42> it was a standard motherboard (I thunk Asus can't remember - one of the 4 char A... makers)
[18:39] <SuperEngineer> penguin42: if Asus - that's good [enough] - thanks
[18:39] <solarcloud_3scrn> aria .. least there from Manchester and the money stays in the region.
[18:40] <penguin42> solarcloud_3scrn: Well, for Aria I'd say at least it's from Manchester so I can get on a bus and slam it down on their desk if it doesn't work; but if I'm doing stuff via post I don't really care
[18:41] <solarcloud_3scrn> personally, If you dont care then use the proper Auction site channels .. ebay/freegle/preloved.co.uk
[18:41] <SuperEngineer> ...my honourable colleaugue's [aka me] last remark re statutory right if not fit for purpose applies
[18:42] <SuperEngineer> and yes - I did see argos on-site notice re the return policy on this machine
[18:42] <solarcloud_3scrn> .. that way you sdhaft the lot of them.
[18:43] <solarcloud_3scrn> Do you know how to-d a saved search on ebay.co.uk ??
[18:43] <solarcloud_3scrn> **to-do
[18:45] <SuperEngineer> solarcloud_3scrn: you do realise that address is a redirect I assume
[18:46] <solarcloud_3scrn> A penny saved in a penny earned :D   what www.ebay.co.uk ??
[18:47] <solarcloud_3scrn> **...saved is a...
[18:47] <SuperEngineer> nah - the ebay/freegle/preloved.co.uk is a redirect
[18:48] <solarcloud_3scrn> they're separate sites, of course.
[18:48] <SuperEngineer> yup
[18:48] <SuperEngineer> rule 1 in safe browser use - no redirect declare - no go
[18:48] <solarcloud_3scrn> No one does saved searches here .. I mean some of those sites do RSS and everything..
[18:49]  * solarcloud_3scrn bangs his head on his desk aaaagain.
[18:50]  * SuperEngineer hands solarcloud_3scrn some virtual aspirin
[18:50]  * solarcloud_3scrn checks his 17 emails from ebay.co.uk to save £££, for solice.
[18:51] <SuperEngineer> ;)
[18:53]  * SuperEngineer checks his own - sent without using sites doing undeclared redirects
[18:54] <solarcloud_3scrn> Say cheese .. http://goo.gl/UmQBb
[18:55] <SuperEngineer> or say chose
[18:56] <solarcloud_3scrn> or say chookies .. http://www.instructables.com/id/Cookie-Bra/ :)  mmmh cookies..
[18:57] <SuperEngineer> cookie-bra? are you suggesting I've got man-breasts!
[18:57] <SuperEngineer> not yet
[18:58] <SuperEngineer> ...beware - it's been a nasty day at work, I'm in a silly mood
[18:59] <solarcloud_3scrn> oh Ok .. but , seriously I do have moobies .. :(
[19:01] <solarcloud_3scrn> Apparantly it's 7 to 2 with Wiliam Hill that Murrray will Win Wimbledon , this year.
[19:03] <solarcloud_3scrn> 10 t 1 that Middleton will have twins ... due to hyperemsis-gravidarum with Sportingbet.
[19:05] <SuperEngineer> solarcloud_3scrn: ...and for Charles ever taking the crown?
[19:06] <SuperEngineer> [low odds I assume]
[19:06] <AlanBell> I think he will for a few hours at least
[19:07] <SuperEngineer> definite lol
[19:07] <AlanBell> stick it on, do one big speech, and hand it over

[19:28] <solarcloud_3scrn> thoughts ??
[19:29] <dwatkins> your head feels like a cardboard computer?
[19:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> total over-reused.
[19:34] <SuperEngineer> what's needed here is a "my head hurts - stop it" lens.
[19:36] <SuperEngineer> [I have one of those lenses - but it's attached to my camera, not my Ubuntu]
[19:39] <SuperEngineer> On a more quizzical topic -anyone heard when/if G+ might change the APi to alllow external apps proper access?
[19:44] <solarcloud_3scrn> I haven't heard ..but if a google communities lense pops up .. It'll be the end of this type of #channel. IMHO
[19:45] <solarcloud_3scrn> I mean popey's already a sex symbol on the Ubuntu community  (sorry Mr Pope !)
[19:45] <popey> hah
[19:45] <popey> hardly
[19:47] <solarcloud_3scrn> you just need to change "Screenshots" to "Screenshot Friday"  and I'd at least check my account every Saturday.. just to see. ...
[19:53] <SuperEngineer> Impressed by this blokes thoughts http://tinyurl.com/sensible-thought [planet-gnome]
[19:53] <AlanBell> !bloke
[19:54] <SuperEngineer> [sorry bloke/blokess]
[19:55] <SuperEngineer> ...& yes - should have read bloke's - I slap my wrist
[19:55] <AlanBell> should have read "woman's" :)
[19:56] <AlanBell> and apparently lubotu3 doesn't know anything about bloke
[19:56] <SuperEngineer> AlanBell: you win!
[19:56] <SuperEngineer> but still impressed
[19:57] <solarcloud_3scrn> SuperEngineer, MMh, Funny, My dad said never do business with bfriends !" when I was 10 years old.. it decimated my investments-club for over 15 years.. until I woke up.
[19:57] <SuperEngineer> AlanBell: Impressed by this woman's thoughts http://tinyurl.com/sensible-thought [planet-gnome] - any better?
[19:58] <SuperEngineer> !blokess
[19:58] <SuperEngineer> nope not blokess either

[19:59] <SuperEngineer> oh tut tut!
[19:59] <lubotu3> Please investigate with me only with "/msg ubottu Bot" or in #ubuntu-bots.  Search for factoids with "/msg ubottu !search factoid".
[19:59] <AlanBell> :)
[19:59] <solarcloud_3scrn> I seems to have seen her webpage before ??
[20:00] <AlanBell> probably, she was a director of Gnome and now is a director at Mozilla
[20:00] <solarcloud_3scrn> #/msg ubottu !custard-creams
[20:00] <solarcloud_3scrn> soz .. just checking...
[20:01] <AlanBell> !botsnack
[20:01] <lubotu3> Yum! Err, I mean, APT!
[20:05]  * SuperEngineer votes for !pooter to be added to lubottu. pooter: "the machine you're using, doh!"
[20:06] <daftykins> i think factoids are generally best having an actual purpose
[20:06] <SuperEngineer> darn
[20:07] <SuperEngineer> but very tactfully put ;)
[20:09] <DJones> hmmh, suggestions that Blizzard are planning a Linux game announcement sometime this year http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTI2ODE
[20:10] <daftykins> ^_^
[20:11] <solarcloud_3scrn> Iwas just wondering .. I've  got a hard-disk for old XP-machine-desktop from 2004 .. I was wondering if there was a good virus-scanner tosee if I *was* completely infected or not , that say does a free trial for 30 days , or not ?
[20:12] <solarcloud_3scrn> I haven't used a good anti-virus since Ubuntu.
[20:13] <daftykins> i think some people scan slaved Windows drives with clamav
[20:14] <DJones> This lists quite a few https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
[20:15] <solarcloud_3scrn> clamav .. is terrible but thanks DJones .. opening...
[20:16] <DJones> Heh, just looking at the eset website, they offer a linux antivirus scanner with a link to a free online scanner, when you try it, it wants to download & install a .exe file....Linked from a page offering a linux AV system, DOH!
[20:17] <solarcloud_3scrn> haha !  BTW .. has anyone ever tried "avast.com/linux-home-edition" ??
[20:19] <daftykins> DJones: geniuses
[20:20] <daftykins> why don't you try it and tell us? :)
[20:22] <DJones> In a word..... Nah!
[20:25] <solarcloud_3scrn> .. takes 30 minutes to get the reg. key .. but I will do !
[20:25] <mh0> i never even knew there was antivirus for linux
[20:25] <mh0> nor that it would be needed
[20:25] <mh0> lol
[20:25] <solarcloud_3scrn> it is thoretically possible :)
[20:25] <mh0> usually any threat, I just iptable
[20:43] <bigcalm> In Python, how do I check a variable to be this? <flags GDK_WINDOW_STATE_FULLSCREEN of type GdkWindowState>
[22:29] <dutchie> bigcalm: generally explicit type checking in python is Wrong, but use the type function
[22:32] <bigcalm> dutchie: I tracked down what I was meant to do, hopefully correctly :)
[22:32] <bigcalm> Ta for the pointer
[22:36] <dutchie> np
