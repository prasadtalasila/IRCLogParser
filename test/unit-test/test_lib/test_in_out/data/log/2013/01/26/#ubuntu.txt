[00:01] <nomoney4me> good evening everyone
[00:02] <nomoney4me> would anyone be able to help me with setting up my newly installed ubuntu laptop?
[00:06] <carif> can anyone recommend a keyboard layout utility? I'm trying to figure out what scancodes my microsoft wireless comfort 4000 keyboard is actually generating
[00:06] <cholby> hey is there an ubuntu I can put on my iphone?
[00:07] <cholby> I don't like iOS
[00:07] <bean> cholby: no
[00:07] <Random832> carif: showkey will give you scan codes
[00:07] <Random832> carif: run it on the console, and 10 seconds of silence to quit.
[00:07] <cholby> bean somebody told me there was a mobile version in beta
[00:07] <cholby> i can't find it though
[00:07] <cholby> is it on sourceforge?
[00:08] <bean> cholby: whoever told you that was a liar.
[00:08] <Random832> cholby: it's not going to be for iphones, most likely
[00:08] <cholby> why can't I just put the current version of ubuntu on my phone?
[00:08] <bean> because that is not how phones work
[00:08] <bean> they're specialized to run one certain piece of software
[00:08] <Random832> bean: in theory it is, there could totally be a cyanobuntumod
[00:09] <bean> Random832: on iphone?
[00:09] <Random832> but i don't think ubuntu phone OS is even ready at all, let alone ready to be ported to random hardware
[00:09] <shwaiil> hi
[00:09] <Random832> bean: IIRC someone did once successfully install android on an iphone
[00:10] <shwaiil> Q: Can we use "Hot corners" like Osx ? I just got use to it at work... ! Thanks for looking! ubuntu 12.10
[00:10] <will3032840> Hello? I need some help with ubuntu and a WDNA3100v2.
[00:10] <Random832> but it's certainly a lot harder to make work than a pc, and like i said i don't think ubuntu mobile is even ready at all yet
[00:10] <jrib> shwaiil: I  would be surprised if there isn't some compiz plugin for that
[00:10] <will3032840> this is a dev question, cause I need the WDNA3100v2 working for ubuntu ARM.
[00:11] <will3032840> as in a belkin WDNA3100v2.
[00:12] <bean> Random832: there was a linux on iphone project like 3 years ago
[00:12] <carif> Rand832, ty. Is there a way to get the codes translated into their symbolic equivalents? e.g. Left Alt seems to be generating keycode 111
[00:12] <will3032840> Hello? why isn't anyone responding

[00:14] <bean> will3032840 please do not beg for people to answer

[00:14] <ubottu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
=== linuxthefish is now known as linuxthefish`
[00:20] <Random832> carif: what do you mean by symbolic equivalents?
[00:21] <Random832> you asked for scancodes, not symbols
[00:21] <Random832> try xev (run in X, not console) if you want what X is interpreting as, but you said to find out what scancode it is actually sending
[00:21] <carif> Random832, yup, I asked the wrong question, xev will give me symbols, ty
[00:22] <Random832> apt-get install x11-utils if it's not by default
[00:22] <bean> will3032840: does your device show up in dmesg when it gets plugged in?
[00:22] <will3032840> can I repost my question or not?
[00:23] <bean> will3032840: does the usb device show up in dmesg?
[00:23] <bean> or
[00:23] <bean> lsusb
[00:23] <will3032840> bean: yes, and it identifies the device correctly but it says no interfaces avalible
[00:24] <bean> will3032840: thats a broadcom chip, yeah?
[00:26] <liveusb> what's the password for root on the 12.10 live image?
[00:26] <dblinx> Here is a question.... just got hit with a few viruses and maleware on my eeb server... need to know a way to make sure its clean
=== SuBmUnDo is now known as Villar_Roberto
[00:26] <bean> liveusb: why do you need the root password? ubuntu doesn't have a root user with a password by default.
[00:26] <bean> !sudo | liveusb
[00:26] <ubottu> liveusb: sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[00:27] <bean> dblinx: as in windows viruses or bad scripts in linux?
[00:27] <scristopher> dblinx, clamav will do the job
[00:27] <scristopher> also were the sites php based sites that got hit?
[00:28] <bean> dblinx: what scristopher says plus http://www.rfxn.com/projects/linux-malware-detect/ maldet will work well
[00:28] <gustavo> bean: windows viruses are made by smart people... bad scripts in linux are made by new or bad users
[00:28] <Ben64> dblinx: depends what you mean by "got hit"
[00:28] <filantropus> can someone tell me how i activate the java plug in mozilla firefox?
[00:28] <bean> gustavo: not necessarily.
[00:28] <dblinx> Scripts
[00:28] <scristopher> if they were php based sites that got injected depending on the obfuscation clamav may or may not detect it
[00:28] <Ben64> dblinx: reinstall
[00:28] <filantropus> pls
[00:29] <bean> you can try running maldet
[00:29] <scristopher> dblinx, were these websites that got injected with malware?
[00:29] <bean> on it
[00:29] <dblinx> Or restore from backup
[00:29] <bean> but that'll quarentine all bad files.
[00:29] <escott> filantropus, you should be aware there are multiple java zero-days out there in the wild. its not a safe thing to be doing
[00:29] <scristopher> or ?
[00:29] <dblinx> Yes
[00:29] <scristopher> well there is a easy way to find stuff if clamav doesnt
[00:30] <Ben64> if they were able to have a login on the computer, nothing is safe
[00:30] <scristopher> find . -name "*.php" | xargs grep base64 --- if it is base64 encoded stuff
[00:30] <filantropus> ?
[00:30] <dblinx> How... clam found 20 infectioned fikea
[00:30] <scristopher> clam should remove the stuff as well
[00:31] <scristopher> i like to get the base64 encoded crap and decode it, save it for later study myself
[00:31] <filantropus> i'm installing it from the java page
[00:31] <escott> filantropus, java is insecure. you should be very wary of using java in a webbrowser
[00:31] <Myrtti> escott: some banks in their infinite wisdom require sun java to use their Internet banking systems
[00:31] <escott> !openjdk | filantropus
[00:31] <escott> !info openjdk | filantropus
[00:31] <ubottu> filantropus: Package openjdk does not exist in quantal
[00:31] <dblinx> Ill try that... what if its a x86...
[00:31] <filantropus> then, how can i run a game that needs java¡
[00:31] <filantropus> ?
[00:32] <escott> !info openjdk-7-jre
[00:32] <ubottu> openjdk-7-jre (source: openjdk-7): OpenJDK Java runtime, using Hotspot JIT. In component main, is optional. Version 7u9-2.3.4-0ubuntu1.12.10.1 (quantal), package size 220 kB, installed size 682 kB
[00:32] <escott> filantropus, ^^^ finally thats the package
=== mb is now known as Guest52021
[00:33] <scristopher> dblinx, are you asking me?
[00:33] <escott> Myrtti, the last thing i would call the banking industry is "wise" certainly not infinite ;)
[00:33] <dblinx> Yes...
[00:33] <scristopher> ... im not sure what you mean by that because i think we are talking about 2 different things
[00:33] <daftykins> escott: probably why it's a common non-literal phrase :P
[00:33] <scristopher> base64 is the type of encryption alot of malware uses
[00:34] <scristopher> if you can find any y ou can decode it
[00:34] <filantropus> thanks.. but... how can i install that package...
[00:34] <Myrtti> escott: no kidding. my point being that openjdk/icedtea isn't always an option
[00:34] <filantropus> sorry, i'm new on this...
[00:34] <dblinx> Ok... wil try that and see
[00:35] <escott> Myrtti, that doesn't change the recommendation not to use it.
[00:35] <scristopher> dblinx, i recommend to use either php to decode base64 or this site http://www.whitefirdesign.com/tools/unobfuscate-php-hack-code.html
[00:35] <escott> filantropus, sudo apt-get install package-name
[00:35] <escott> !apt | filantropus
[00:35] <ubottu> filantropus: APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome), !Muon (KDE) or !Apper (KDE)
[00:35] <scristopher> if you find base64 code it will break down into plain text as long as its not a base64 encoded image
[00:36] <Myrtti> escott: besides, Firefox can be set to allow to run java only on set whitelisted domains.
[00:38] <escott> Myrtti, then perhaps you can tell filantropus how to setup that whitelist
[00:39] <lauratika> videos ending with .MOV extensions play sketchy no matter what player im using... totem,smplayer etc etc. any ideas why?
[00:39] <bean> lauratika, have you tried VLC? I wonder if it'd be better.
[00:39] <kouriinu> i need help with ubuntu can someone help me
[00:40] <damselfly9> possibly
[00:40] <bean> !ask | kouriinu
[00:40] <ubottu> kouriinu: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience

[00:40] <lauratika> i dont have it, but so far all other extensions pĺay well... wonder if there is an issue with this sort of files.
[00:40] <filantropus> Escott
[00:41] <filantropus> the instalation of package is done
[00:41] <filantropus> but the game still is asking for plug in.
[00:41] <bean> lauratika: vlc may help.
[00:41] <bean> lauratika: i prefer it on *nix, to be honest.
[00:41] <kouriinu> tried to download ubuntu but the program doesnt come up to say try or download it goes straight to /grub/i386-pc/normal.mod not found grub rescue tried boot repair it doesnt work
[00:41] <escott> filantropus, im sure there is a plugin package as well
[00:42] <escott> filantropus, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java#Browser_plugin recommends the icedtea-7-plugin
[00:42] <bean> kouriinu: how many hard drives do you have
[00:42] <tty> I am wondering in bash can I take tree > (and have a different directory for a file to go.).
[00:42] <dr_willis> kouriinu:  you mean youy tried to download the ISO file from ubuntu.com? or what exactly
[00:43] <kamel> hello
[00:43] <kamel> :)
[00:43] <gwen_fifty-six> Hello! I'm french but I don't found a solution to my problem in the french documentation... I'm on Ubuntu Studio, and I can't use 2 screens in the same time because I have a shadow on my first monitor.... You can help me?
[00:43] <bean> tty: that would be a complicated script.
[00:43] <kouriinu> i mean that i put the iso on a disk (not on this computer ) and when i booted it it went straight to /grub/i386-pc/normal.mod not found
[00:43] <scristopher> tty, what do you mean
[00:44] <bean> kouriinu: so your live-cd does not boot? or after installation?
[00:44] <kouriinu> correct live-cd does not boot i have tried 3 other live-cd and they dont boot either
[00:44] <sw> !studio | gwen_fifty-six

[00:44] <scristopher> im not sure i understand but i would be happy to help with your script tty
[00:44] <bean> kouriinu: and that computer is set to boot off cd?
[00:45] <bean> kouriinu: what sort of computer is it?
[00:45] <kouriinu> i do believe so yes it is a dell insprion
[00:45] <bean> kouriinu: what model of inspiron
[00:46] <kouriinu> N5050
[00:46] <gwen_fifty-six> Ubottu, This isn't only a package, I have installed Ubuntu studio with a live CD, and I have the low latency 'noyau' too...
[00:46] <ubottu> gwen_fifty-six: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[00:46] <lauratika> try vlc and it's worst seems to be an issue with mp4 files...
[00:47] <tty> I can't write to the directory I want to use the tree < (file). So I want to make the file go to a directory that I can write to.
[00:48] <bean> kouriinu: hmm, i'm not sure what the issue would be. Ususally that happens after you install and grub doesn't install correctly. What OS was on the laptop before?
[00:48] <damselfly9> kouriinu; when you said you tried 3 different cd's, did you download each separately or did you just try using the same iso image three times?
[00:48] <escott> tty, is your use of "<" an indication you are asking about bash redirection?
[00:48] <scristopher> thats what im wondering
[00:48] <kouriinu> i downloaded three seperately
[00:48] <kouriinu> and it was windows 7
[00:49] <scristopher> simply writing a file to a directory should be easy, redirecting a file to a directory should be as well
[00:49] <burner___> can anyone help me get unity working?  Compiz keeps crashing and i'm left with no window management and no dash... if i get a term open quick enough, i can run openbox --replace and work without a dash yet, but I really want to try unity instead of xfce
[00:49] <kubotsu> or, he just wants to move the file .. fancy words decoded
[00:49] <scristopher> heh
[00:49] <damselfly9> kouriinu; do the downloaded iso files match their checksums?
=== burner___ is now known as burner
[00:50] <kouriinu> i dont know
[00:50] <kouriinu> how do you know that
[00:50] <tty> I am taking < to write to file so I can see all the directories and files.
[00:50] <scristopher> oh
[00:50] <bean> kouriinu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM#MD5SUM_on_Windows
[00:50] <scristopher> i think
[00:50] <bean> tty... are you just wanting a list of all files under this directory?
[00:51] <tty> Yes. But I want it in a txt but the problem is that I can make a text file that I am trying use tree on.
[00:52] <kouriinu> i can not use that because the computer i am trying to put it on does not reconize any os now and the computer i am downloading the iso on isnt windows
[00:52] <tty> can = can't
[00:52] <escott> tty, so you "tree > /full/path/to/somewhere/you/can/write"
[00:52] <kouriinu> how do i check it on ubuntu
[00:52] <shwaiil> Q: Is there a way to have Tabs or split screen in the terminal window ?
[00:52] <bean> kouriinu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM#MD5SUM_on_Linux
[00:52] <escott> shwaiil, yes
[00:53] <bean> shwaiil: sure, there are lots of terminals and emulators that can split screen
[00:53] <scristopher> for i in $(ls filename); do mv $i -($date +%Y%m%d); done ?
[00:53] <damselfly9> kouriinu; if the cd never booted, how could it make your windows unbootable (?)
[00:53] <scristopher> something like that heh
[00:53] <scristopher> prolly not
[00:53] <scristopher> but its hard to tell
[00:53] <erg> i'm using pkg-config to get the libs path for linking to opencv, but it's searching in /usr/local/lib instead of /usr/lib. i removed the libs from that path but need to make it find the right ones.
[00:54] <bean> tty: why do you need to write it to a file?
=== XenGi_ is now known as XenGi
[00:54] <kouriinu> well when i first put it in it booted downlaoded and then the grub error happened....i got the boot repair disk put it in it said it worked and when i put the boot disk back in it wouldnt pull up the ubuntu menue
[00:54] <erg> the /usr/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc file doesn't have any reference to /usr/local -- where is pkg-config getting /usr/local from?
[00:55] <kouriinu> the disk i used to boot ubuntu on the other computer was the same one i used to boot in on the another computer nad it worked fine
[00:55] <filantropus> hi Escott
[00:55] <filantropus> that plug in
[00:55] <kubotsu> i've had similar issues with burnt .iso's
[00:55] <filantropus> doesnt work...
[00:56] <kubotsu> even on the same computer , same disc wont work a second time .. quite wierd
[00:56] <damselfly9> weird, almost like the cd lost data almost immediately
[00:57] <guest29584> Can anyone suggest a good place to find some grub2 experts to look at the output of "bootinfoscript" and suggest some grub2 repairs? (I have already posed my question in #grub and am waiting for a response there.)
[00:57] <dr_willis> or the drive that burnt it was a little wonky or weak spots on the cd.
[00:57] <kouriinu> i have redownloaded and booted the re downloaded iso on another disk
[00:57] <escott> filantropus, is it listed in "about:plugins" in firefox? have you restarted firefox
[00:57] <kouriinu> and it STILL doesnt work
[00:57] <dr_willis> guest29584:  the askubuntu.com site and the forums
[00:57] <kouriinu> but itll playy other disks fine like itll use the boot repair disk fine just not the ubuntu iso disk
[00:57] <dr_willis> kouriinu:  try making a bootable usb may  be the best thing to try
[00:57] <filantropus> i have restarted firefox
[00:57] <escott> guest29584, you certainly won't find anyone with grub knowledge here. its not like ubuntu uses grub or anything
[00:58] <damselfly9> oh. just thought of something, what are the chances that the first ubuntu boot that worked wrote some garbage back to the cd because it was being booted in a burner?
[00:58] <kouriinu> i will try that but i can figure out how to make it bootable on my usb iv looked at videos but dont understand i guess im techilogically stupid
[00:58] <escott> damselfly9, 0
[00:59] <filantropus> what thats about:config thing?
[00:59] <escott> filantropus, just type it in like an address
[00:59] <filantropus> yes
[00:59] <filantropus> shows a great list
[00:59] <escott> filantropus, and i suggested about:plugins not config
[00:59] <filantropus> ups
[00:59] <filantropus> sorry
[00:59] <kouriinu> so how do i get it bootable on a usb
[01:00] <guest29584> dr_willis: Thanks, I'll look.  escott: Ha, nice. I meant no offense. Would you like to help?
[01:00] <dr_willis> kouriinu:  dozens of tools at the pendrivelinux site to put the iso on usb.
=== voja is now known as Solwi
[01:00] <kouriinu> ok i will try that
[01:00] <dr_willis> kouriinu:  or theres imageing tools that basically do a direct data dump of the  iso to the usb. those can be the least problematic
[01:00] <filantropus> IcedTea-Web Plugin (using IcedTea-Web 1.3 (1.3-1ubuntu1.1))
[01:01] <escott> guest29584, if you would like to ask. its not offensive just silly. walk into the emergency room and ask if they have a phonebook because you need to call a surgeon
[01:01] <escott> filantropus, then you have the plugin.
[01:01] <filantropus> yes.
[01:01] <filantropus> but doesnt work...
[01:02] <Scunizi> I'm thinking of picking up a USB turntable. If you have experience with any that work please let me know.

[01:14] <WBF> damselfly9: well I cannot now that it's out of the box and radioshack's horrible return policy ):
[01:14] <guest29584> escott: Well, after I temporarily installed an old DOS 6.22 drive for troubleshooting and removed it after, grub2 now doesn't seem to find anything bootable. I'm not sure why. I thought the script might help?
[01:14] <escott> !info lm-sensors | pak
[01:14] <ubottu> pak: lm-sensors (source: lm-sensors): utilities to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors. In component universe, is extra. Version 1:3.3.1-2ubuntu2 (quantal), package size 98 kB, installed size 395 kB
[01:15] <Vivekananda> Hello everyone
[01:15] <damselfly9> WBF; then absorve the cost, buy another different dongle and give this one to a friend who uses windows
[01:15] <pak> ubottu, Thank you.. par i tried it and this is not able to detect the sensors..
[01:15] <escott> guest29584, what do you mean "installed dos 6.22" was it on another hard disk you attached and then removed?
[01:16] <pak> ubottu, I am getting this error.. /sys/bus/pci/devices: No such file or directory at /usr/sbin/sensors-detect line 2900.
[01:16] <ubottu> pak: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[01:16] <escott> guest29584, also please clarify cant find anything bootable. meaning nothing boots or windows doesnt boot
[01:16] <damselfly9> WBF; a second dongle is probably cheaper than a second arm device
[01:16] <pak> ubottu, I want to know he file from where it is reading the temperatures..
[01:16] <ubottu> pak: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[01:17] <escott> pak, its not reading from a file
[01:17] <guest29584> escott: As far as I know, everything I did was virtual (on a VirtualBox image of the drive), but there could be a bug, error, problem?
[01:17] <pak> escott, So from where it is getting the data ?
[01:17] <escott> pak, or at least not all of it.
[01:18] <pak> escott, I am currently looking fo the cpu temperature part only..
[01:18] <escott> pak, lots of places. querying the i2c bus for instance
[01:18] <escott> pak, find /sys -iname "*temp*" or find /sys -iname "*therm*"
[01:19] <escott> pak, how these things work changes depending on what chipset you have
[01:19] <pak> I am looking for arm chipset.
[01:20] <guest29584> escott: I don't have the message in front of me, but it is not finding anything to boot, and not coming up with the boot menu. A long sentence about insert boot media I think it said. Not my lengthy grub2 menu.
[01:20] <escott> guest29584, is this a message from the bios or from grub's preloader?
[01:21] <escott> guest29584, sounds like a message from the bios which suggests you need to go into the bios and confirm the correct boot device is selected
[01:21] <Vivekananda> anyone familiar with bash script. It is a quick and simple question. I am just replacing \w the PS1 with \W but it seems not to work .
[01:21] <Vivekananda> http://pastebin.com/qawuac9Z
[01:21] <guest29584> escott: I'm not completely sure, It's been a long time since I had to deal with either. Is there a page where I can peruse grub2 messages?
=== Darth is now known as Guest78261
[01:22] <escott> guest29584, grub would never say "insert boot media" so if it says that its the bios
[01:22] <pak> escott, Thank you.. I got it .. it reading from /sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp2_input file..
=== stfu is now known as Guest4143
[01:25] <usuario_> paco1
[01:26] <guest29584> escott: As far as I know, the correct boot device is selected. I was paraphrasing a long message in a few words. I am running on an Ubuntu live CD now, and I can see, mount, browse, etc. the two drives in question. I tried a simple sudo ubdate-grub, but got "/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?)."
[01:26] <escott> guest29584, if you are going to update grub from the livecd you need to chroot first. did you do that? do you know how to do that? your grub.cfg looks ok
[01:28] <escott> guest29584, i would write down or take a  picture of the error message you are getting so we can figure out exactly where it is coming from
[01:28] <guest29584> escott: Oops, sorry, s/ubdate/update/  No, this is the first time anything like this has happened. Do you have a link?
[01:28] <escott> guest29584, i would not waste your time with a chroot just yet
[01:29] <guest29584> escott: OK, I will write the message down if/when I reboot. In the meantime, is there a place where I can look at likely suspect messages from grub2?
[01:30] <guest29584> escott:  (Perhaps I can identify it from memory.)

[01:36] <uiopqwer> how can i get notifications-daemon to display multiple bubbles. older versions used to do this :(
[01:37] <n0sq> is there a way to fix my sudoer file even though i can't get into it? or will i have to re-install ubuntu?
[01:38] <escott> n0sq, you can boot the livecd and chroot in or boot to the rescue/single user mode

[02:04] <bakpak2hvy> oh, you're looking for something like two kids in a sandbox
[02:04] <justmeh> harrisr, first, apple products are not shitty
[02:04] <justmeh> interfaces are sparse, and devices tend to be locked in
[02:04] <harrisr> i know i never said they were
[02:04] <justmeh> but just moving some songs?
[02:04] <justmeh> no u didnt
[02:04] <harrisr> yeah
[02:05] <bakpak2hvy> i did!
[02:05] <justmeh> [18:03:30] <bakpak2hvy> harrisr: again, no shitty apple products
[02:05] <justmeh> that was for bakpak2hvy
[02:05] <justmeh> anyway, ive used a lot of programs, usually you can just plug the device in and the default system audio player will deal with it, or have a plugin for it
[02:06] <KylieBrooks> so fireeefox sux for memory

[02:09] <justmeh> the short answer is no, the longer answer is maybe

[02:09] <harrisr> anyway rythmbox wants to initilize my itouch but wont let me select model number
[02:10] <ntzrmtthihu777> the conky config files reference two fonts, caviar dreams and Santana. How do I check if the fonts are installed?
[02:10] <JakeR5555> darksidesimmons thanks you help me.. i didnt even think about it that way
[02:10] <escott> harrisr, there is presumably a reason for that. apple is known for intentionally breaking any application that attempts to talk to their products that is not itunes. its probably related to that

[02:45] <Dave77> thanks.. if there is a bug in file download page.. who would fix it?
[02:45] <M61> ntzrmtthihu777: done it, few times already still it loads only WIN7
[02:45] <bean> kouriinu: you should probably just reinstall if there is nothing you care about on there.
[02:45] <bean> And during that process it will fix your problems
[02:45] <ntzrmtthihu777> bean: Dave77 wants 64 bit, not 32 bit

[03:01] <bean> yeah...
[03:01] <dr_willis> since it wasent avaiable to test befor release

[03:09] <kevinmthomas> i am running here

[03:10] <kevinmthomas> oh
[03:10] <joseneto> justmeh : iam
[03:10] <kevinmthomas> when i run a portscan 110 and 143 are closed as they are open in the router
[03:10] <justmeh> joseneto, cool ;)
[03:10] <kevinmthomas> when i remove them from teh router they become stealth again
[03:11] <dr_willis> stealth  ;)
[03:11] <justmeh> kevinmthomas, are you doing port triggering or forwarding?
[03:11] <kevinmthomas> well im not sure I am new to this
[03:11] <justmeh> triggering might not be so reliable..
[03:11] <kevinmthomas> i belive its port forwarding
[03:11] <justmeh> k
[03:11] <kevinmthomas> in my cisco router
[03:11] <justmeh> is the mail server on your local network?
[03:11] <kevinmthomas> however the ports are blocked
[03:11] <bean> kevinmthomas: so you're trying to connect from the outside world to your ubuntu server at your house
[03:11] <kevinmthomas> the mail sever is on the local server
[03:12] <justmeh> nmap yourself
[03:12] <kevinmthomas> yes see - i can send and receive emails just fine its using a program like thunderbird
[03:12] <joseneto> justmeh, almost there (installing)
[03:12] <kevinmthomas> where the problem occurs
[03:12] <justmeh> k?
[03:12] <kevinmthomas> or outlook
[03:12]  * justmeh nodds @ kevinmthomas 
[03:12] <justmeh> that's not the same though
[03:12] <kevinmthomas> so i beleive it is related to the closed ports
[03:13] <kevinmthomas> hmmm
[03:13] <justmeh> thunderbird or the other is trying to connect to 1.2.4.5:xyz
[03:13] <bean> kevinmthomas: well, you need to make sure your forwarding is right in your router.
[03:13] <justmeh> when running a mail server its YOURIP:xyz
[03:13] <justmeh> so if your isp has that port closed then you are unable to run one

[03:14] <justmeh> (whois'd you)
[03:14] <kevinmthomas> here is a dumb question - when a port is closed and it is open in the router, is it definately teh ISP?
[03:14] <arooni-mobile> dr_willis, its crashing tho
[03:14] <dr_willis> arooni-mobile:  i imagine its not from that warning then.
[03:14] <justmeh> no

[03:15] <kevinmthomas> i hear you bean
[03:15] <justmeh> PC (firewall, daemons) -> router -> modem -> net
[03:15] <justmeh> any one of those can close it
[03:15] <dr_willis> arooni-mobile:  i recall there being some command line options to use a failsafe/clean  profile you may want to try. it could be a plugin causing the issue
[03:15] <arooni-mobile> dr_willis, how can i do that
[03:15] <kevinmthomas> i dont belive there is a firewall open in ubuntu server
[03:16] <kevinmthomas> i looked for that
[03:16] <bean> there is, but its not on by default
[03:16] <justmeh> kevinmthomas, i'm gonna scan ur ports
[03:16] <kevinmthomas> ok
[03:16] <kevinmthomas> please do
[03:16] <dr_willis> arooni-mobile:  check the command line options to the browser      normally    command --help     will show them

[03:16] <justmeh> come to #flood kevin
[03:17] <kevinmthomas> join the room #flood?

[03:35] <CryptoSec> hello to everyone in #ubuntu channel room... I'm running 12.04 and I'm having a problem printing text documents to my HL-2140 brother printer... in one of my attempts... I tried printing a 4 page documents but all i get is an endless papers coming out of my printer with  zero texts printed on any one of the pages....  And it just keeps printing pages after pages way beyond the 4th page.  ...
[03:35] <CryptoSec> ...What do you guys think the problem might be?? drivers messed up?
[03:35] <craigbass1976> CryptoSec, I'm surprised.  HP has been good about giving out drivers
[03:36] <craigbass1976> CryptoSec, Oops, that's a brother, isn't it?
[03:37] <craigbass1976> CryptoSec, did you grab the driver from their site?

[03:43] <misterswag> how would i copy it to /srv/mysql?
[03:43] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, which place are you trying to make the symlink at?
[03:44] <craigbass1976> CryptoSec, try the ones on brother's site
[03:44] <TheLordOfTime> i assume /srv/mysql would be the link to /var/lib/mysql?
[03:44] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, ^
[03:44] <misterswag> yes TheLordOfTime
[03:44] <misterswag> so sudo cp -R -p?
[03:44] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, sudo ln -s /var/lib/mysql /srv/mysql
[03:44] <TheLordOfTime> assuming /srv/ exists and needs superuser creation rights.
[03:44] <misterswag> thanks TheLordOfTime
[03:44] <TheLordOfTime> s/creation/modification/
[03:44] <misterswag> yes it does
[03:45] <puff> When I try to install or remove a package, I get an error 'ldconfig' not found in PATH or not executable.
[03:45] <puff> https://gist.github.com/a3c3d4eb084dd373c9e2
[03:45] <misterswag> to copy /var/lib/mysql over there TheLordOfTime do i do sudo cp -R -p /var/lib/mysql /srv/mysql?
[03:45] <Barfolomew> has anyone gotten emacspeak to work?
[03:45] <puff> I'm looking at a forum thread about downloadnig libc and manually extracting ldconfig, but I'd like to understand what went wrong to begin with.
[03:46] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, this is why symlinks exist: you don't need to copy them all over if they exist elsewhere, just set up the symlink with the command i gave you
[03:46] <misterswag> oh im trying to move it out of /var/lib
[03:46] <misterswag> since its limited space
[03:46] <misterswag> :)
[03:46] <misterswag> and symlink it back so i dont have to mess with apparmor
[03:46] <misterswag> and the configs
[03:47] <CryptoSec> craigbass1976: should I use the cupswrapper or LPR driver? It's the first time I came across such a decision for my printer?
[03:47] <misterswag> TheLordOfTime, so my objective is copy it out to /srv/ and symlink it back
[03:47] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, erm... i don't advise that, since the mysql executable uses /var/lib/mysql...
[03:47] <TheLordOfTime> s/executable/process/
[03:48] <misterswag> yeah so cant i cp it to /srv/mysql
[03:48] <misterswag> and symlink it back to /var/lib/mysql
[03:48] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, ideally first, you turn off the mysql process first...
[03:48] <misterswag> yes i did
[03:48] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, then sudo mv /var/lib/mysql /srv/mysql
[03:48] <TheLordOfTime> then sudo ln -s /srv/mysql /var/lib/mysql
[03:48] <TheLordOfTime> but I HIGHLY recommend you don't do that
[03:48] <misterswag> will it get messy?
[03:48] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, just because mysql is weirdly tempermental
[03:49] <misterswag> i see
[03:49] <craigbass1976> CryptoSec, I can't remember.  We have an MFC at work and I don't remember which one I grabbed -- that was three years ago.  Anyone else?  Is LPR or cupswrapper a better bet to grab from Brother's website?
[03:50] <misterswag> TheLordOfTime, currently i have my ssd to mount as /var
[03:50] <misterswag> i would just like to give all of /var/lib/mysql to that ssd
[03:50] <misterswag> possible?
[03:50] <elb0w> So I just upgraded to 12.10. I am getting this issue when I select my headphones and play music from the shell it is not going to them
[03:50] <misterswag> that would be my other scenario
[03:50] <elb0w> it goes to my speaker instead
[03:50] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, that's going outside my expertise, but i don't think it'd be easy to set up
[03:50] <TheLordOfTime> misterswag, especially since /var/* is already there
[03:50] <misterswag> yah
[03:51] <TheLordOfTime> in fact i think it'd be incredibly hard
[03:51] <misterswag> it sounds iffy too
[03:51] <misterswag> lol
[03:51] <misterswag> all i can do is just use it till it runs out of space
[03:51] <misterswag> mysqldump
[03:51] <misterswag> and make sure /var has enough space
[03:51] <misterswag> lol
[03:52] <misterswag> on next install
[03:52] <elb0w> nvm fixed it
[03:52] <elb0w> good ole pacmd
[03:52] <CryptoSec> craigbass1976: I did some Google search and I found that LPR is more command line and cups has more gui front end to it... so it just matters what the user is comfortable and his preference.
[03:55] <CryptoSec> and with that... I just answered my own question...
[04:03] <wiz007> how to reset fonts to ubuntu defaults
=== __mmiller is now known as __mikem

[04:04] <__mikem> oh great I don't remember the password for my nick
[04:05] <__mikem> oh well, I am having trouble getting wireless to work on my laptop. I have a centrino n-1000 wireless chip and no matter what I do, it asks for the wireless password, waits for a bout a minute then asks for it again
[04:06] <Dave77> how do I find the device name of a USB stick/sd card writer?  Is there some way from file explorer? I'm trying to partition an SD card in USB stick.

[04:12] <Dave77> Kanoh: found it thanks
[04:13] <__mikem> does anyone know how to get the centrino n-1000 wireless chip to work with ubuntu?
[04:15] <damselfly9> http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi
[04:15] <puff> Ah, hm.. okay, adding /sbin to my regular shell PATH before invoking sudo fixes that.
[04:15] <puff> Weird.
[04:15] <damselfly9> that link was for __mikem
[04:16] <__mikem> thank you, looking
[04:16] <jjgalvez__> linux-backports-modules-cw-3.x-precise-generic, there are 3.3,3.4,3.5,and 3.6 which one should I install? I wanted to get the updated backported wireless drivers from my card
[04:18] <tetchey> Can I extend the authentication timeout for GUI apps like the Ubuntu Software Centre? I have made the timestamp_timeout 60 minutes in the sudoers file, but the USC seems to ignore it
[04:18] <__mikem> And this is already starting to look like more trouble than its worth.

[04:22] <damselfly9> that second link gives really easy instructions, __mikem. they might even work
[04:25] <__mikem> damselfly9, yes. I did the rfkill list thing and nothing is blocked except my blutooth.
[04:25] <__mikem> and I don't think the bluetooth has anything to do with my wireless

[04:31] <dell_> anyone know about antix? it wont go into suspend on my del latitude
[04:32] <damselfly9> rfkill probably would have given you an error if it was a hardware problem
[04:32] <__mikem> yeah
[04:32] <__mikem> the hardware works fine because it sees all the available access points
[04:33] <damselfly9> probably just your system networking setup

[04:39] <__mikem> damselfly9, yeah I had an adventure with broadcom a few years back, although I atleast got it working with fwcutter
[04:39] <__mikem> it wasn't very reliable though
[04:40] <damselfly9> that link to the ubuntu wifi troubleshooting page might help

[04:46] <dell_> :
[04:47] <carrey> -_-
[04:48] <__mikem> dell_, this channel is for ubuntu. Antix is a different distribution

[04:52] <__mikem> dell_, there doesn't appear to be an antix channel, but there is a generic linux channel called ##linux. Someone in there might know about antix

[05:03] <__mikem> I used to be able to go to this thing that said Aditional DRivers, and it used to autodetect everything and give me the option of enabling things like graphical drivers and stuff

[05:05] <__mikem> found it.
[05:06] <__mikem> Says nothing is in use, although there should be atleast the graphics driver installed, although the graphics card on this machine doesn't work on windows either, so maybe its broken.

For more information see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM . For ARM specific support, stop by the #ubuntu-arm channel.
[05:11] <crocket> ubuntu tablet is certainly a win.
[05:11] <a_b0y> isn't nexus 7 google?
[05:11] <crocket> I don't want a stripped down version of linux, which is android.
[05:11] <crocket> A full-fledged linux table is desirable.
[05:11] <crocket> table -> tablet
[05:11] <mikemike> can anyone help me on a c++ algorithm ?
[05:11] <dr_willis> good luck finding  a full featured linux tablet at this time.
[05:11] <cfhowlett> a_b0y, yes nexus is google, but it will run ubuntu
[05:12] <crocket> mikemike : That's for C++ or #algorithm.
[05:12] <a_b0y> i don't like google
[05:12] <mikemike> nobody is on #algorithm
[05:12] <dr_willis> they are testing a ubuntu on the nexus 7
[05:12] <crocket> mikemike : You have to be patient.
[05:12] <crocket> Give it hours or half a day.
[05:13] <crocket> mikemike : Or use stackoverflow
[05:13] <crocket> mikemike : You can utilize http://stackexchange.com/
[05:13] <dr_willis> stackoverflow is handy ;)
[05:13] <a_b0y> so will this ubuntu tablet only work on google products?
[05:13] <Noskcaj> dr_willis, it works fine as long as you don't try to dual-boot
[05:13] <mikemike> i know about stackoverflow .. i was looking for a quick answers since I don't have some hard code
[05:13] <crocket> Will the ubuntu tablet contain a full featured ubuntu OS?
[05:13] <mikemike> just a bubble sort
[05:13] <cfhowlett> a_b0y, there IS no ubuntu tablet available
[05:14] <dr_willis> a_b0y:  there is a port of ubuntu to the Nexus7 its the ONLY one i know of at this time
[05:14] <crocket> What a disappointment.
[05:14] <dr_willis> there was mention of a Kubuntu tablet some months back. but not sseen it mentioned anywhere lately
[05:14] <crocket> I'll have to buy a lightweight laptop.
[05:14] <dr_willis> we have NO info on any  ubuntu tablets. :) we dont know what may come out in the next year
[05:15] <Noskcaj> crocket, acer c7 chromebook $200, done
[05:15] <dr_willis> that chromebook i hear works well
[05:15] <a_b0y> so this ubuntu port a fresh install port or will it just piggyback off of android?
[05:15]  * cfhowlett also hear good things about chromebook
[05:15] <kepler> i want an asus zenbook prime, the 11 inch with 1080p screen, but im waiting for them to make the bezel smaller (and hopefully add a gige card)
[05:15] <dr_willis> You can run ubuntu in a VM on most any mondern rooted android devicce.
[05:15] <majnoon> pulseaudio is enabled by default correct ??
[05:15] <crocket> Noskcaj, Isn't it too cheap?

[05:19] <dr_willis> seel:  you just use the full path.
[05:19] <dr_willis> seel:  or use ctrl-h to have the file manager show .whatever files
[05:20] <dr_willis> cp foo  ~/.whatever/whever
[05:20] <majnoon> ok installed pa vol control (not correct name) did EXACTALLY what i wanted :)
[05:20] <dr_willis> or  hit ctrl-l and type in the path in the file manager
[05:21] <Soelen> what is going on with my webserver?
[05:22] <dr_willis> Soelen:  checked your logs yet?
[05:22] <seel> so using nano, how would I do that exactly?
[05:22] <dr_willis> seel:  save it to ~/.irssi/scripts
[05:22] <seel> I have the script in there but to save it in the right place...
[05:22] <Soelen> dr_willis: kinda, I guess those logs on var/www/apache2, but I didnt found any hints there
[05:22] <seel> when I did that it said permission denied
[05:22] <dr_willis> or save it to your home directory then copy it to ~/.irssi/scripts
[05:23] <Soelen> I am not even sure if it's the webserver or something else
[05:23] <dr_willis> seel:  you sure that directory exists?
[05:23] <dr_willis> seel   mkdir ~/.irssi/scripts
[05:23] <seel> yeah, I did that already
[05:23] <kepler> did you do it as root?

[05:25] <cfhowlett> nuxninja, greetings
[05:27] <seel> looking it up, it actually shows the file is already there in the right place
[05:27] <seel> ls ~/.irssi/scripts/bitlbee_rename.pl
[05:27] <seel> that's the file, so that's right
[05:28] <dr_willis> use 'cat' instead of ls - to verify the proper stuff is IN the file
[05:28] <dr_willis> and use  'ls -l'   instead of ls to veryify the ownership and permissions  of the file
[05:29] <dn40> alias
[05:30] <seel_> got disconnected for some reason...
[05:30] <seel_> but yeah, when I try to load it I just get a permission denied for some reason
[05:30] <koveras0927> even as root?
[05:31] <seel_> I'm not logged in as root, no
[05:31] <dr_willis> seel_:  may  be time to check the irssi docs and the #irssi channel
[05:31] <dr_willis> and use ls -l to verify the permissions and ownwership of the file   and 'cat' to verify its contents
[05:32] <seel_> ok
[05:32] <koveras0927> so irssi is an irc program and you're having trouble installing it?
[05:32] <dr_willis> hes having trouble getting a script he made to load in it
[05:32] <seel_> well, and each new script I create or download has to be given permission to be executible, right?
[05:32] <koveras0927> oh
[05:33] <koveras0927> ha way above me, I'm not really there yet
[05:33] <dr_willis> seel_:  no idea on that in irssi. i dont see why it would need to be executable..  the #irssi channel woul dbe the place to ask
[05:33] <seel_> someone else's script but yeah, it's for facebook actually
[05:33] <dr_willis> I perfer weechat to irssi
[05:33] <seel_> it's to show the names rather than the numbers for people on facebook

[05:59] <tim_> XD i would kill windows on my netbook but i need it for school
[05:59] <koveras0927> from windows i don't think there is one, just download it from the xubuntu website, use unetbootin to install it to a flash drive, and boot off the flash drive
[05:59] <Noskcaj> tim_, install either lubuntu-desktop (all of the stuff from the iso) or lubuntu-core (just the DE (i think))
[06:00] <koveras0927> or lubunu
[06:00] <Noskcaj> koveras0927, Wubi?
[06:00] <Noskcaj> koveras0927, use LiLi instead, it's better
[06:00] <tim_> oh right. for linux you can mix and match
[06:00] <cfhowlett> Noskcaj, there it is.  sudo apt-get install lxde
[06:00] <koveras0927> Noskaj: I've never actually used LiLi, then again I usually go with straight ubuntu
[06:01] <Noskcaj> koveras0927, it's windows only, probably the best usb maker there is
[06:01] <koveras0927> Noskaj Actually I think I've used this before, I only found unetbootin when my cd drive broke back in 08
=== nuxninja is now known as jamaican-brotha
[06:02] <tim_> noted. ive got to use a usb key to install  what ever i end up using
[06:03] <koveras0927> tim_ try using both, whatever you can get working first, but it's not hard.
[06:03] <koveras0927> tim_ have you ever set up a dual boot before?
[06:03] <tim_> im kind of a noob when it comes to linux install
[06:03] <tim_> and no
[06:04] <jamaican-brotha> unetbootin is a piece of cake...just experiment
[06:04] <koveras0927> so your chromebook is running windows 7 you said?
[06:04] <tim_> netbook* but yes
[06:04] <jamaican-brotha> tim_ nothing to worry just take ur time
[06:05] <koveras0927> do you know how to shrink your windows partition to allow space to install linux?
[06:05] <tim_> no i dont.
[06:05] <tim_> okay i know nothing about linux install
=== zhurai-tsuki is now known as zhurai
[06:05] <koveras0927> right click computer, click manage, and go to disk management. Right click your main windows partition C: and click shrink
[06:06] <koveras0927> then you just put in the size in MB that you want your linux partition to be, I'd say 40 would be fine for just learning how to use it
[06:06] <koveras0927> 40GB, not MB
[06:07] <tim_> okay
[06:07] <koveras0927> then after you shrink your partition you'll have free space for linux, use unetbootin/LiLi to make a bootable usb drive and boot off of it, then it's pretty self explanatory from there
[06:08] <tim_> okay thanks
[06:08] <tim_> ill make sure i do a full backup first
[06:08] <koveras0927> Good idea :D
[06:09] <koveras0927> when you click install lubuntu or whatever ubuntu distro you're installing, click the option saying install alongside windows, it will keep both windows and linux and let you choose what to boot when you start up next time
[06:09] <tim_> okay thanks for all the help!
[06:11] <lud> when comes out to market the ubuntu phone?

[06:24] <jbud> Hey #ubuntu, I'd like to set a few hotkeys, as well as remove some pre-set hotkeys from here (12.04), but under Settings->Keyboard->Shortcuts I'm unable to remove some hotkeys, and also I cannot use certain keys in the bindings for my own (anything with Alt and PrintScreen).

[06:35] <jbud> Hahah
[06:35] <jbud> Saw this the other day too
[06:36] <LiThiuME3> :P
[06:36] <LiThiuME3> thanks
[06:36] <jbud> np :)
[06:36] <LiThiuME3> Im quite the new indeed at linux
[06:36] <LiThiuME3> its my first VPS
[06:37] <LiThiuME3> started a week ago
[06:37] <jbud> Really/ How are you enjoying things so far?
[06:37] <guideX> there's a weird clicking problem i've noticed in ubuntuy
[06:37] <guideX> ubuntu
[06:37] <LiThiuME3> I like the challange and the head banging part of it :P
[06:37] <guideX> where you must click three times sometimes
[06:37] <guideX> in the folders
[06:37] <jbud> Love Linux :) I'll be trying out Arch when I get my PC fixed up next week
[06:37] <cfhowlett> guideX, on 12.10?
[06:37] <LiThiuME3> jbud no GUI ssh only
[06:38] <guideX> hmm I don't know, i will check
[06:38] <guideX> (sorry lame windows user)
[06:38] <jbud> lol
[06:38] <jbud> Damn you Windows users!
[06:38] <guideX> :/
[06:38] <guideX> yeah (kicks can)
[06:38]  * jbud angrily shakes fists
[06:39] <guideX> ubuntu 11.04
[06:39] <LiThiuME3> jbud reading a lot of tuts online and guides etc...
=== xubuntu is now known as Guest98145
[06:39] <jbud> guideX: pretty sure I had a similar issue when I started, I went to settings -> mouse/touchpad   and played with the settings
[06:39] <cfhowlett> guideX, system>settings  mousepad is where you should look
[06:39] <jbud> LiThiuME3: Really? Are you into any scripting at all?
[06:39] <guideX> hmm ok
[06:39] <LiThiuME3> Still having problem with my deluge and other stuff I want to figure out if I can setup a dns server on my box also I need to find what runs my ftp server
[06:40] <guideX> I would be happy with just a click, or two clicks.. thanks
[06:40] <LiThiuME3> jbud no not really I need to learn bash
[06:40] <jbud> That's what completely sold it for me. I love being able to build scripts so easily with the huge range of tools
[06:40] <guideX> also..
[06:40] <guideX> is there anything exactly like notepad?
[06:40] <jbud> LiThiuME3: Bash is super easy to pickup :)  tldp
[06:40] <jbud> guideX: gedit
[06:40] <cfhowlett> guideX, exactly like?  no. Similar to?  absolutely
[06:40] <guideX> I'm pretty slow and shakey with it
[06:40] <guideX> I perfer regular old notepad for php stuff..
[06:40] <LiThiuME3> learn a new command that is my fav now lol pgrep
[06:41] <Ciphoenix> better than notepad IMHO
[06:41] <guideX> well i could do vi i guess
[06:41] <jbud> Love vim
[06:41] <guideX> nothing is better than notepad, except visual studio ofc
[06:41] <guideX> well for me..
[06:41] <jbud> guideX: I wrote a wiki on vim if you want for a reference: http://wiki.jbud.me/index.php?title=Vim
[06:41] <LiThiuME3> jbud need to learn vim to I read that Its superior to nano once you konw how to use it :P
[06:42] <jbud> After reading through the documentation
[06:42] <jbud> vim is awesome I love it
[06:42] <guideX> also... if I want to have ubuntu, but without the terrible new interface in 12, is there an option or
[06:42] <guideX> but without "fooling around" with it
[06:42] <Ciphoenix> you mean notepad++?
[06:42] <kepler> guideX, i use kubuntu
[06:43] <guideX> ok
[06:43] <LiThiuME3> jbud do you know why when I creat a new user on my box it only have > when it log in SSH and not username@this:
[06:43] <jbud> LiThiuME3: I'm still trying to get things figured out though. Like matching the intellisense to netbeans for Java or Visual Studio for .NET
[06:43] <jbud> LiThiuME3: You're in something right now
[06:44] <jbud> Like, a program or something
[06:44] <jbud> Basically its waiting for you to type something else
[06:44] <jbud> its like, if you were in bash and you said:   while true; do
[06:44] <jbud> its waiting for you give more
[06:44] <jbud> Try ctrl+d
[06:44] <LiThiuME3> kk 1 min
[06:45] <LiThiuME3> ok
[06:45] <LiThiuME3> nice
[06:45] <jbud> :D
[06:46] <LiThiuME3> now I need to figure out my problem with deluge lol
[06:46] <jbud> Hahah
[06:47] <jbud> I'm giving up local torrenting now
[06:47] <jbud> I grabbed myself a seedbox for $6/mo
[06:47] <LiThiuME3> Well my VPS is a seedbox pretty much
[06:47] <jbud> Such a good deal, plus my ratio has raised through the roof
[06:47] <jbud> Oh yeah

[06:52] <jbud> Woah!

[06:52] <jbud> lol
[06:53] <kepler> still waiting for a chance to speed test on one of the 10 gig links. im on a gig port now
[06:53] <kepler> not sure boss would be happy about running fiber to a workstation...and stealing one of the cards from a server
[06:54] <LiThiuME3> hahaha
[06:55] <jbud> So I wonder if this will be standard speeds soon then
[06:55] <jbud> For everyday residentials
[06:55] <kepler> i hope so.

[06:56] <kepler> i was happy to get 105 down 20 up. if i can get gig/gig, id probably explode
[06:56] <jbud> Lol dl a movie in like 3 seconds
[06:57] <jbud> LiThiuME3: Can you cp it at all? Even in any other folders?
[06:57] <LiThiuME3> cp: cannot create regular file `../reencode_serie.sh': Permission denied
[06:58] <jbud> o interesting, its the folder that's having problems
[06:58] <jbud> Creating files within that folder
[06:59] <guideX> in 11.04 how do you get to the "task manager"

[07:00] <guideX> hmm ps aux
[07:00] <jbud> You'll also want to grep for the specific task you're looking for

[07:36] <aeon-ltd> BlackWeb: 2 partitions? or are they assigned different /dev/sdx?
[07:36] <arshavin> BlackWeb: you mean like /dev/sda and /dev/sdb
[07:36] <guideX> omg there's like bazillions of them
[07:36] <guideX> chromiums
[07:36] <BlackWeb> Have a 3tb Hard Drive been trying to format Fdisk -l  Shows the same hard Drive as /dev/sde & /dev/sda
[07:36] <jbud> lol yes Chrome does that
[07:36] <guideX> oh ok
[07:37] <guideX> it does it on windows too but more like 4-5
[07:37] <guideX> which is a lot for windows :P
[07:37] <_raven> how is the chance to get ubuntu phone for asus padphone2?
[07:37] <jbud> guideX: o actually I'm speaking from past experience on Windows. Haven't checked it out for Linux actually
[07:37] <arshavin> BlackWeb: that's really strange have you tried gparted?
[07:37] <theadmin> _raven: Is it a multli-core phone?
[07:38] <afotek> Hello. I want to dual boot Windows and Ubuntu. How do I prepare a partition for Ubuntu before installing Windows? As I understand, it's better to install Windows first. Do I make an extended partition or plain ext3 partition?
[07:38] <theadmin> _raven: If so, likely.
[07:38] <jbud> I found Chrome to be really awkward and buggy on linux, so I swapped to Firefox
[07:38] <arshavin> BlackWeb: that's really strange have you tried gparted or cfdisk?
[07:38] <guideX> jbud there was like two whole pages
[07:38] <kyo> ext3 allowed
[07:38] <BlackWeb> First it only showed it as /dev/sda,  Went ahead `parted -a optimal /dev/sda` Table: gpt and then while it was making partition errored out so exited and now its showing it as 2 devices so now trying to mkfs.ext3 -v -l "" /dev/sde1 and it looks like it just worked, but how am I suppose to tell it to mount

[07:38] <theadmin> afotek: Eh. Just install Windows to an empty hard drive, but leave some unpartitioned space for Ubuntu to use later
[07:38] <guideX> ah cool that worked :>
[07:38] <guideX> now it opens again :)
[07:39] <BlackWeb> when I tried gparted then it errored out while it was making the partition also
[07:39] <afotek> theadmin: Is it possible to leave 50 Gb of unpartitioned space before Windows partition?
[07:39] <arshavin> BlackWeb: it may be because of that gpt thing which is different fro normal mbr

[07:39] <Guest60313> hey i am trying to make a bootlable usb for arch linux and i am using ubuntu but in start up disk creator it doesnt show the duel iso can anyone show me what command i should use its in my downloads folder and my usdb is sdb1
[07:39] <guideX> htop is a nice prog
[07:40] <justmeh> hey Guest60313
[07:40] <BlackWeb> I tried using msdos instead of gpt & it said that it doesnt support over 2TB
[07:40] <theadmin> Guest60313: If you can't read the ArchWiki, don't use Arch. But, sudo dd if=something.iso of=/dev/sdb
[07:40] <justmeh> link me to the page your following
[07:40] <justmeh> nvm
[07:40] <arshavin> Guest60313: what do you mean by does not show
[07:40] <BlackWeb> On my Ubuntu_Server_12.04 it worked fine, Same type of hard Drive & Motherboard
[07:41] <saju_m> how check squid user auth via terminal?
[07:41] <justmeh> why don't you type that into google saju_m lol
[07:41] <theadmin> afotek: From what I've experienced the partitioning in the Windows installer makes that kind of hard. It's easy to leave space after it, though, but are you sure 50GB is enough? Doesn't sound like a lot
[07:41] <arshavin> BlackWeb: is it internal or external
[07:41] <justmeh> http://goo.gl/W300D
[07:41] <Guest60313> arshavin: like i search for the iso and select it and it doesnt show up after i click open
[07:41] <justmeh> its an excellent search
[07:41] <BlackWeb> Internal
[07:41] <saju_m> i googled ando tried lot of things
[07:42] <justmeh> btw not that anyone cares, but i just masterd basic drbd :D
[07:42] <saju_m> but i could not get it
[07:42] <Guest60313> theadmin: ok i didnt use sudo man i feel dumb
[07:42] <arshavin> Guest60313: ou mean when you tab to complete the command
[07:42] <theadmin> Guest60313: Oh, lol
[07:43] <Guest60313> theadmin: ha maybe im not ready to try arch yet if i cant remeber to put sudo lol
[07:43] <nearst> !iso | Guest60313
[07:43] <ubottu> Guest60313: To mount an ISO disc image, type « sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint> » - There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before !burning.

[07:43] <saju_m> my squid setup working and asking for password, if i cofigure it in firefox.
[07:43] <afotek> theadmin: I'm using GParted for partitioning. I have a 1 Tb drive and I'm going to make partition for Ubuntu (50 Gb), partition for Windows (50 Gb) and NTFS partition for the rest for all the data.
[07:43] <saju_m> but i want to test it via termial or another tool?
[07:43] <theadmin> afotek: Woah. You can't store ALL the data on NTFS, especially various user configurations.
[07:43] <keshav> Hey guys !!
[07:43] <arshavin> Guest60313: why do you want to mount arch iso?
[07:44] <keshav> I had a question regarding cloud computing
[07:44] <keshav> ??
[07:44] <keshav> can anyone help me out >>
[07:44] <keshav> ??
[07:44] <theadmin> keshav: Ask the question...
[07:44] <lud> ask buddy
[07:44] <Guest60313> arshavin: i would like to make a bootlable usb so i can try it out never used anything beside ubuntu kubuntu or xubuntu thought i would open my horizons a bit
[07:45] <theadmin> Guest60313: Yeah if you never used anything but Ubuntu Arch is gonna be very hard for you
[07:45] <nearst> try remastersys
[07:45] <keshav> I am quite new to cloud computing and I wanted to make a private cloud just for getting a hang of it. so which platform should i use for it ?
[07:45] <afotek> theadmin: I thought it'll be fine: configs are stored on system partitions and user data is stored on NTFS partition.
[07:45] <arshavin> Guest60313: you just do dd if=x.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=4M
[07:45] <Guest60313> theadmin: well looking for way to force me to increase my knowlege on linux and this looks like what i think im looking for
[07:45] <keshav> openstack opennebula cloudstack ??
[07:45] <theadmin> afotek: Well, depends on what you mean as "user data"
[07:46] <theadmin> Guest60313: Heh, might be better to go with Gentoo then :P
[07:46] <Dave77> what is the equivilant of directX on ubuntu?
[07:46] <afotek> theadmin: music, documents etc.
[07:46] <theadmin> afotek: Oh, that'd be fine
[07:46] <theadmin> Dave77: OpenGL
[07:46] <nearst> Dave77, xorg :P
[07:46] <Guest60313> theadmin: i was looking into that but from most of the reviews sites say arch is easier
[07:47] <saju_m> keshav: try this http://fosshelp.blogspot.in/2013/01/howto-install-openstack-using-devstack.html
[07:47] <kostkon_> neither
[07:47] <Dave77> I mean how difficult can it be for large games company to include linux binary/setup on the DVD?
[07:47] <theadmin> Guest60313: Easier to install? Not really, just faster (less compiling). Easier to use? Heck no, it breaks with almost every update.
[07:47] <kostkon_> the dirextx equivalent is SDL
[07:47] <arshavin> Guest60313: what crap arch is easy only after you have high speed internet a few tutorials and lots of stet
[07:47] <Aziroshin> Are there CDs that won't be able to contain the ubuntu image?
[07:48] <Aziroshin> These CD RWs say they are 700 MB. I suppose they are too small. Why the hell do I even have crap CDs like these? I don't get it. Sigh..
[07:48] <arshavin> Guest60313: this whole arch hype is crap
[07:48] <theadmin> Aziroshin: Uh, all CDs are 700MB...
[07:48] <arshavin> Guest60313: now they don't even allow an offline installation media
[07:48] <Aziroshin> The Ubuntu image is 763, and wodim complains. -overburn doesn't help

[07:49] <theadmin> afotek: yep
[07:49] <afotek> theadmin: Great, thanks!
[07:49] <Guest60313> arshavin: ha so u say gentoo also ? ha guys i just wanna try using something a lil more different ubuntu ive been using for 6 years and i kinda wanna just try something else lol
[07:49] <Aziroshin> I don't have dvds available. I guess I will have to look into that "iso to usb" software I've forgotten the name from.
[07:49] <afotek> theadmin: And can I change hard drive and volume attributes under Ubuntu?
[07:49] <kyo> yes u can
[07:49] <theadmin> afotek: attributes as in...?
[07:49] <Alocer> Aziroshin: unetbootin ? ? ?
[07:50] <antonio_> does anyone have experience getting a broadcom wireless adapter working in 12.10
[07:50] <theadmin> Alocer: No, that never works
[07:50] <antonio_> its such a pain in the @#$#
[07:50] <afotek> Like read-only
[07:50] <Aziroshin> Alocer: I think that might have been it, thanks.
[07:50] <theadmin> Aziroshin: You can just use dd
[07:50] <Guest60313> still and will allways be diehard ubuntu fan i got a galaxy nexus just to be the first to try out ubuntu mobile and have a nexus 7 with ubuntu 13.04
[07:50] <arshavin> Guest60313: if you want try something different then arch is ok
[07:50] <Alocer> :P
[07:50] <Aziroshin> theadmin: I dd the iso onto the raw usb stick and it will work, yes?
[07:51] <arshavin> Guest60313: but they need to provide offline installation media for it to be accepted by everyone
[07:51] <Alocer> Aziroshin: theadmin: i think u should make the usb bootable
[07:51] <lud> @antonio_ ubuntu should install the drivers right away.
[07:51] <theadmin> Aziroshin: Yeah, something along the lines of: sudo dd if=~/Downloads/ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb
[07:51] <afotek> kyo: and what software can I use for that?
[07:51] <antonio_> lud: it didn't
[07:51] <theadmin> Alocer: Nah, just dd'ing it works, Ubuntu images are hybrid
[07:51] <Aziroshin> theadmin: I will just do that, thanks.
[07:51] <Aziroshin> Awesome@hybrid
[07:51] <Alocer> theadmin: Aziroshin: dd is much simpler
[07:52] <Aziroshin> Yeah, I love that dding it over works out of the box, I didn't know that.
[07:52] <nearst> dd is fun im guess
[07:52] <arshavin> Guest60313: check your usb drive device name by typing "sudo fdisk -l" and replace of=/dev/sdx
[07:52] <afotek> theadmin: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS "Attributes: Read-only, hidden, system, archive, not content indexed, off-line, temporary, compressed"
[07:53] <theadmin> afotek: I don't think the Linux NTFS implementation cares for any of those. After all, hidden files in Linux must have names starting with a ".", "system" is a purely Windows thing, and there's no permission implementation for NTFS that's POSIX-compatible so no "read-only" either.
[07:53] <arshavin> nearst: amazing utility if you know how to use it,but terrible if you don't
[07:54] <antonio_> this is so damn annoying..
[07:54] <antonio_> I cannot get my wireless broadcom device to work
[07:54] <theadmin> antonio_: Do you have a wired connection?
[07:54] <nearst> which broadcom
[07:54] <djQuery> just ran var$ chown -R me www  but it fails on 1 directory in there that is currently marked as read only
[07:55] <helmut_> hi
[07:55] <antonio_> theadmin: yes
[07:55] <djQuery> how do I remove the readonly from the directory
[07:55] <theadmin> antonio_: Okay, open the "additional drivers" tool and see if there's a Broadcom driver around.
[07:55] <theadmin> djQuery: sudo chmod a+r www
[07:57] <afotek> theadmin: that's quite bad, because I thought it's possible to create external read-only backup
[07:57] <arshavin> djQuery: run chmod on that directory
[07:57] <djQuery> nopers still happening
[07:57] <djQuery> arshavin, ^^

[07:59] <theadmin> djQuery: Use "sudo -i" to get a root shell and work from there.
[07:59] <djQuery> sudo chmod a+r jquery-ui
[08:00] <djQuery> while in the www directory as well
[08:00] <Guest60313> arshavin: i got it working thank you

[08:00] <antonio_> this is starting to really piss me off...why can't my damn wireless work!
[08:00] <djQuery> theadmin, is that like sudo root
[08:01] <kostkon_> antonio_, did you open the drivers tool and what happened
[08:01] <theadmin> djQuery: "root" is not a command so that doesn't do anything :P
[08:02] <theadmin> djQuery: But it gives you a root shell, similarily to "su -"

[08:18] <Em_> theadmin: what is the package index for?
[08:18] <antonio_> this is so goddamn annoying
[08:18] <theadmin> Em_: Basically it's a list of packages and where to get them from, it's created by "sudo apt-get update"
[08:19] <antonio_> I have so much work to do...and I don't need to be dealing with such minor b.s.
[08:19] <Em_> so the command "sudo apt-get update" updates my kernel and gives it the information or the list of packages wher eto get softwares from, right?
[08:20] <spikeb> it gives updated packages, yes
[08:20] <spikeb> info, that is.

[08:22] <theadmin> Em_: no.. this is weird
[08:23] <warl0k> I've got a linux box running as a VM that *briefly* is responsive to ping while booting, but as services start it stops responding to pings.

[08:23] <antonio_> it is activated
[08:23] <warl0k> can't quite figure out what the hell is going wrong with it.
[08:23] <kostkon> antonio_, then try rebooting and see what happens

[08:28] <kostkon> antonio_, don't think so. you can always reinstall

[08:28] <antonio_> that
[08:28] <antonio_> back in a few...
[08:29] <kostkon> :/
[08:29] <dr_willis> purge and reinstall every pacakge.. ;)

[08:30] <Em_> theadmin: tried rebooting my computer, didn't work.
[08:30] <dr_willis> nope - i wouldent exxpect it to work
[08:32] <warl0k> anyone know of something other than iptables that could cut off a network connection post-boot?
[08:32] <warl0k> because I have thoroughly flushed iptables, I think.

[08:32] <dr_willis> stopping the network service.  ifdown eth0,

[08:33] <warl0k> no panics
[08:33] <dr_willis> wireless or wired?
[08:33] <warl0k> wired.
[08:33] <dr_willis> err.. you flushed the rules then rebooted? that wouldent survvicce a reboot.
[08:33] <dr_willis> survive
[08:34] <warl0k> why would I reboot?
[08:34] <warl0k> it's Linux.
[08:34] <zenu> @war10k Have you tested the ethernet cable with a loop test/ another computer?
[08:34] <dr_willis> you said post-boot...
[08:34] <warl0k> short of changing a core portion of the kernel, there's never a need to reboot.
[08:34] <dr_willis> so it does it on ever bootup?
[08:34] <warl0k> on bootup there is a window of maybe 5 seconds where it will respond to ping.
[08:35] <warl0k> then as services start up, bye-bye goes the network connection.

[08:36] <kepler> Devaki, menu, network list, edit
[08:36] <dr_willis> xchat used to have some very good guides/links in its help menu

[08:36] <kepler> yeah. there is a box for nickserv password
[08:37] <dr_willis> or just make a simple alias you can type to do whatever it is you want.
[08:37] <Devaki> but that doesnt work.
[08:37] <kepler> what doesnt work?
[08:37] <Em_> I can't install gparted. Error: "Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information...

[08:42] <hay> hi, on one of mine kvm guests (I have 8 running without any problems) I get occasional: lost page write due to I/O error messages and can't even umount partitions... the issue still remains with only one guest after changing all the hard drives in the RAID array (we changed drives although nothing strange was in the logs of the host machine)... I am pretty lost why it happens, any ideas are
[08:42] <hay> very appreciated...

[09:19] <antonio_> koston: http://pastebin.com/LTAm3mqm
[09:19] <bekks> Knight2000: You can have up to 18 partitions on a default MSDOS disk label.
[09:19] <bekks> Knight2000: It does not depend on which program you are using.
[09:19] <auronandace> Knight2000: not more than 4 primary partitions no, but one of your primary partitions can be an extended partition into which you can put several logical partitions
[09:19] <thoni> pusing....
[09:20] <thoni> ujan gak berenti2,.......
[09:20] <Knight2000> what si the difference between primary and logical?
[09:21] <auronandace> Knight2000: a logical partition is inside an extended one
[09:21] <bekks> Knight2000: Technically, the difference is the place where the information is stored - primary or extended partition tables.
[09:22] <kostkon> antonio_, just to be sure. the output of:  iwconfig
[09:23] <antonio_> eth0      no wireless extensions. lo        no wireless extensions.
[09:24] <kostkon> antonio_, right ok
[09:24] <Knight2000> i see... But can i convert an partition to a extended whithout formating it?
[09:24] <auronandace> Knight2000: no
[09:24] <Knight2000> ok. i have a problam -.-
[09:25] <bekks> auronandace: Which is not true.
[09:25] <BillyZane2> hi
[09:25] <bekks> Knight2000: Using gparted, you can move your partitions without formatting them, but you should create a backup before.
[09:26] <auronandace> Knight2000: then you need to get rid of one of your primary partitions to put an extended partition in its place then you can put logical partitions inside that
[09:26] <BillyZane2> what's a good media player that will play all file types?
[09:26] <spikeb> VLC, mplayer (and any of its front ends)
[09:27] <BillyZane2> ok...
[09:27] <BillyZane2> ty
[09:27] <Knight2000> @auronandace but i really need all of this 4
[09:27] <kostkon> antonio_, apt-cache policy broadcom-sta-source
[09:27] <auronandace> bekks: an extended partition is a container for logical partitions, so you can't convert a primary into an extended without getting rid of all its contents
[09:28] <auronandace> Knight2000: then you either need to get another harddrive or use a vm
[09:28] <antonio_> koston: here you go http://pastebin.com/9A0d35dZ
[09:28] <kostkon> antonio_, if you don't have it then give the following: sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source && sudo apt-get install broadcom-sta-common
[09:29] <antonio_> I'm going to hold off for just a second...updating everything
[09:29] <kostkon> antonio_, nice, then do what ive told you
[09:29] <kostkon> antonio_, and then reboot
[09:29] <Knight2000> ok... i will get a ssd an put windows on it. after that i will use my old C partition for Ubuntu
[09:29] <Knight2000> should work, or?
[09:30] <auronandace> Knight2000: yes, just curious, what is on the 4 primaries that you can't get rid of?
[09:31] <jim__> Hi, I tried gnome 3.6 (fedora 18 and ubuntu 12.10) and it's unusably slow compared to gnome 3.4, unity and kde. i just move windows and lags so bad. It only happens when i use nvidia driver, nouveau seems to work better. Is there any solution?
[09:31] <Knight2000> C is for OS and some programms that must be installed on the same partition as windows, D for Data and E for all other programms
[09:32] <auronandace> Knight2000: so thats 3, is the other a system restore partition?
[09:32] <Knight2000> the last one is just 100MB named System Reserved. I think i is for the Windows BootLoader
[09:33] <Knight2000> had vanilla installation of windows. no restore partition
[09:33] <auronandace> Knight2000: i make sure my windows only takes up 1 partition, frees the others up for more OSes
[09:34] <antonio_> :(
[09:34] <antonio_> no workey
[09:34] <Knight2000> it takes just one. but i have to share Data and Programms (using Wine) with both OSs
[09:35] <kostkon> antonio_, :/
[09:35] <antonio_> this is driving me nuts!
[09:35] <auronandace> Knight2000: it would be a very bad idea to share a programs folder between wine and windows

[10:09] <bekks> The first uses forks, the second threads.
[10:09] <txomon> bekks, but by default, which is used?
[10:10] <bekks> txomon: I think it is prefork, but I'm not that sure about it.
[10:12] <Petrov> hmm, i have installed win 8 and now i'll install ubuntu (dual boot, on the same hdd), but ubuntu can only see my hdd and not the partitions?
[10:12] <txomon> bekks seems that Apache HTTP Server - high speed threaded model
[10:12] <txomon> is the one used
[10:13] <bekks> txomon: The term "threading model" applies to both methods.

[12:04] <Mrokii> theadmin: And if I don't want to wait for 13.04?
[12:05] <Mrokii> theadmin: Maybe I found an answer myself. There seems to be a repository for Qt5.
[12:06] <k1l> Mrokii: if you want it for ubuntu-phone the get-started guide mentions a PPA: http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/
[12:06] <megha>  if i am  having .xinitrc file, how can i execute it ?
[12:07] <megha> because in there, there are few commands to be executed before the dwm starts.
[12:07] <k1l> megha: restart the dm?
[12:07] <megha> conversely where can i put those command that are there in .xinitrc file ?
[12:07] <theadmin> Mrokii: Installing an unsupported Qt version can likely break Qt apps. You've been warned.
[12:07] <jrib> megha: how do you login/
[12:07] <megha> k1l: but if we are using login manager you can't use .xinitrc file
[12:07] <Mrokii> k1l: I was just interested in Qt5 in general.
[12:08] <Mrokii> theadmin: Okay, thanks.
[12:08] <megha> jrib: still i have to disable the login manager and execute the .xinitrc script.
[12:08] <jrib> megha: is that what you want to do?
[12:09] <megha> jrib: if there is another way round than it's more better. keeping the login manager and also executing commands in .xinitrc script
[12:09] <k1l> megha: so you want a autostart for programs?
[12:10] <jrib> megha: create a ~/.xsession (instead of ~/.xinitrc) and use "user xsession" session in your login manager
[12:10] <g0tcha> hey guys, how can i check if im running the latest version of a package in ubuntu server?
[12:10] <theadmin> k1l: Most desktop environments read commands in ~/.config/autostart, will that do?

[12:12] <jrib> g0tcha: show the output of « apt-cache policy znc » and your attempt at upgrading it in a pastebin please
[12:12] <k1l> g0tcha: maybe need to run a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
[12:12] <theadmin> k1l: Well, it's more of a folder with .desktop files with Exec= lines, but all in all that does what it needs to do, run programs on login.
[12:12] <g0tcha> jrib, alright, one sec
[12:12] <megha> jrib: what you meant was instead of .xinitrc file create .xsession file and from the login manager select user xsession right ?
[12:14] <jrib> megha: yes
[12:14] <g0tcha> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1572524/
[12:14] <theadmin> Mrokii: Well, go ahead -- just if it breaks don't blame me :P

[12:30] <badday> theadmin: yeah, I know, but currently I have only the core installed and therefore no graphical UI and therefore no login screen
[12:30] <jrib> megha: no, what that first answer says is what I do.  But he mentions that it will execute .xinitrc and that is wrong.  It will execute ~/.xsession
[12:31] <megha> ya correct

[12:31] <badday> AtumT, theadmin: is there not also a dpkg-command?

[12:34] <megha> jrib: so how can i do autostart from programs in window managers ?
[12:34] <megha> i.e. manually
[12:34] <jrib> megha: use ~/.xsession and select the session you just created in your login manager
[12:34] <megha> if this works than this will be helpfull as then there will be no need for any file.

[12:36] <badday> ioria: sorry, didn´t get u
[12:37] <auronandace> !aptitude | ioria
[12:37] <ubottu> ioria: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.

[12:40] <markaum> Hello, does anyone here know how to install oracle database on ubuntu?
[12:41] <markaum> I'm having a lot of trouble trying to install it
[12:41] <bekks> markaum: Thats not officially supported by Oracle.
[12:41] <patrunjel> hi, could anyone please recommend an mp3 player/addon that remembers where I've stopped listening to something and starts from there the next time I play the file?
[12:42] <bekks> markaum: Because it isnt supported :)
[12:42] <markaum> bekks: I know, we use RHEL for our servers, but we are trying to change the OS that the dev team is using
[12:43] <bekks> markaum: Which will lead to an totally unsupported environment which leads to the loss of support by ORacle. Best advice: Dont do it.
[12:45] <markaum> bekks: We develop software using the Oracle ADF Framework, and we have to use JDeveloper. Using JDev on windows is frustrating, crashes a lot
[12:45] <markaum> bekks: On Linux, we have a huge gain of productivity. The only setback is having to use virtual machines to run Oracle Linux
[12:47] <badday> ioria, megha, AtumT, theadmin: The thing is that if I restart it tells me "failed to load session ubuntu", therefore I would like to check which desktop environments are installed

[12:53] <patrunjel> thanks, I'll try it out and see how it goes
[12:53] <Aziroshin> I know it does it for video files
[12:53] <Aziroshin> I doubt it'll be any different for mp3s.
[12:54] <patrunjel> it might, since you expect mp3s to be songs and such, but I'll sort it out

[13:34] <dandandan> sure
[13:35] <dandandan> ok ill make a paste
[13:37] <mrshr3d> Kyle - you might be able to, I'm no expert but there are good tuts on regret just do a google
[13:37] <watcha> hm just got my apache server running, everything is fine from here, I can see my site just fine.. but not from my laptop on the same local network? just show 404
[13:38] <mrshr3d> Watcha, can you see it by IP address?
[13:38] <watcha> not from my other computer no,  and from the server itself it just redirects to localhost when using ip.
[13:39] <watcha> but when I restart apache, it say( servers fully qualified domain name .... 127.0.1.1 ... for servername=
[13:39] <ikonia> watcha: so ?
[13:40] <ikonia> watcha: that's only a warning because you've not set a valid fqdn

[13:40] <nbt> is that what you meant?
[13:40] <watcha> okay, so that's nothing to worry about?
[13:40] <dandandan> ok so heres the deal, im wgetting a file to a ubuntu server and i get a http redirect like so pastbin.com/1YFJAfK9 . n
[13:41] <ikonia> watcha: it means it's just bound to that ip address, as there is no fqdn
[13:41] <dandandan> from centos, and older versions of ubuntu it works fine
[13:41] <dandandan> and ive tried it from different providers/locations, same result

[13:42] <dandandan> it only seems to happen on ubuntu
[13:42] <dandandan> i cant really share it
[13:42] <ikonia> then I can't really help
[13:42] <dandandan> it has sensitive information
[13:42] <dandandan> i can show you what the server is returning if you like
[13:42] <ikonia> it's fine, I'll leave it there - good luck
[13:42] <dandandan> i can dump the headers and edit them out

[14:12] <TomyLobo> bekks yes, i realize. it's still nuts
[14:12] <ThinkT510> wildNBK: depends what filesystem you put on it
[14:12] <ThinkT510> !fstab | wildNBK
[14:12] <ubottu> wildNBK: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[14:12] <TomyLobo> it allows you to lock yourself out of your server, for instance

[14:14] <ubottu> sote: Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux. except where files are then passed to windows computers (perhaps using samba), See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
[14:14] <sote> the only nasty site is redtube
[14:14] <TomyLobo> so you dont need antivirus, eh?
[14:15] <TomyLobo> yesterday i was told in this channel, that there's nothing stopping a keylogger from logging my password entered into kdesudo
[14:15] <BluesKaj> !antivirus | TomyLobo
[14:15] <ubottu> TomyLobo: Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux. except where files are then passed to windows computers (perhaps using samba), See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
[14:15] <sote> that's what I thought, I do access windows via the QNAP err well the storage folders like media
[14:15] <ThinkT510> TomyLobo: a keylogger isn't a virus
[14:16] <TomyLobo> but it's malware and an antivirus would detect it
[14:16] <bekks> TomyLobo: No. AntiVIRUS is designed against VIRUSES. :)
[14:16] <sote> clam-av works well but never needed to use it
[14:16] <bekks> TomyLobo: It will not detect rootkits, etc.

[14:18] <ThinkT510> TomyLobo: not all "antivirus" products protect against all malware threats
[14:18] <BluesKaj> bekks, then the question is , is linux safer from rootkits and keyloggers than other OSs ?
[14:18] <mangoix> ThinkT510: why shouldnt keylogger be virus? caouse it is a smaller version of virus, that calls for a trojan.
[14:19] <bekks> mangoix: Because a keyloagger does not spread itself.
[14:19] <sote> only issue I was having earlier was in Gnome Classic... Couldn't change the clock from 24-hour to AM/PM even though in the advanced settings it said it changed but the clock still showed 24-hour format :( so I logged out of Gnome Classic and into Gnome

[14:21] <sote> I thought all computers kept a log of the keys that have been pressed/ typed
[14:21] <TomyLobo> that would be insane

[14:25] <TomyLobo> "virus", "keylogger" and "trojan" are distinct categories of malware, that may or may not come bundled in one package. malware from each of these categories is detected by one or another program commonly referred to as "antivirus". can we agree on that?

[14:34] <ThinkT510> zimbo: best asked in ##linux

[14:34] <zimbo>  ThinkT510 ok

[14:36] <DJones> TomyLobo: You'd still need to input a password before the keylogger could run, if you're not sure what you're installing, you probably shouldn't install it anyway

[14:37] <TomyLobo> DJones you mean it's impossible to log your own keys with user rights?
[14:37] <DWSR> sgo11: Because of mp3 headers and padding.
[14:37] <zimbo> i could write a key logger in c in about an hour lol not that difficult
[14:37] <DWSR> sgo11: The picture was removed, but the space has been left so that the file does not need to be completely rewritten if you add a new picture of similar, or smaller size.
[14:37] <mangoix> DWSR: A keylogger may be a virus as well. thats the fact! so leave it now..
[14:37] <sote> topic is dropped, moving on too see what others need help with!
[14:38] <TomyLobo> zimbo could it log user A's keys if run as user A?
[14:38] <DWSR> sgo11: There should be a way to remove padding from files in easytag.
[14:38] <zimbo> what?
[14:38] <DJones> TomyLobo: You could do that in your own user environment, but without it being installed with admin rights, what could it do with it
[14:38] <zimbo> of course
[14:38] <sgo11> DWSR, I want to delete that space too. how can I do that? The picture is mis-added with very big resolution. let me check easytag settings...
[14:38] <sote> Djones, Thankyou, have a nice night/day
[14:39] <TomyLobo> DJones "own user environment"? like a box in a box? :)
[14:39] <TomyLobo> and i don't know what something can and can't do with admin rights, with respect to logging keys. that's why i'm asking :)
[14:40] <zimbo> it would log your passwords for example
[14:40] <zimbo> like you bank info
[14:40] <zimbo> etc
[14:40] <TomyLobo> or your own password which you enter into sudo
[14:40] <DJones> TomyLobo: Its probably a better conversation to have in #ubuntu-offtopic, thats more for general discussion like that
[14:40] <Jpmh> I have a bootable usb stick from which I have made many systems - usually I get a choice of installing alongside the existing Windoze - on HP Compaq machines I do not get this - is this becuase they have setup too few partitions

[14:41] <TomyLobo> DJones we're at a conclusion anyway, i think. will you follow? since you seem to have the power to change that factoid :)
[14:41] <ThinkT510> TomyLobo: in the vast majority of cases malware is nothing to worry about on linux unless you frequently download things from sources you don't trust
[14:41] <DJones> TomyLobo: Are you ok with a pm?
[14:41] <TomyLobo> sure
[14:42] <TomyLobo> not by everyone. go away mangoix

[14:48] <ThinkT510> sote: ah, more help can be found in #freenode too
[14:49] <sote> should I make a complain about the threats I got from another user or should I just forget about it
[14:49] <sote> easier to forget
[14:49] <sgo11> DWSR, I really don't find a way to remove the padding space of id3 tag from mp3. do you know how to do that? or which key words should I google for? thanks.
[14:49] <ThinkT510> sote: better to forget
[14:49] <DWSR> sgo11: Not really sure.
[14:50] <Jpmh> sote: if the threats are real you should pass them immediately to your local Police Department
[14:50] <DWSR> Jpmh: Probably just an ITG.
[14:50] <sgo11> DWSR, I did search remove padding, but no luck. let me do more search then. thanks. :)

[14:51] <sote> learn something new every day
[14:51] <Jpmh> DWSR: I would agree - however a few reports to PDs tend to build up and get them under control
[14:51] <nearst> sgo11, try sudo apt-get install easytag
[14:51] <sgo11> nearst, the problem is caused by using easytag. :)
[14:51] <DWSR> Jpmh: With the only problem being the fact that you have no idea who they are in real life.
[14:51] <DWSR> Jpmh: Still, this is OT.
[14:52] <nearst> sgo11, thereis a lot of id3 editor in foss :)
[14:52] <LiquidDemocracy> I want to play a Java game in Firefox. What package do I have to install?
[14:52] <Jpmh> DWSR: I assure you that the logs are sufficient that if the PD follows up it can all be traced
[14:52] <ThinkT510> LiquidDemocracy: firefox has likely disabled your java plugin
[14:52] <DWSR> LiquidDemocracy: It should be installed by default, but https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxPlugins should help you
[14:52] <sgo11> nearst, yeah, but I can not find one which can remove the picture and its space. easytag removes the picture, but the size of mp3 is unchanged. it keeps the picture space there.
[14:52] <DWSR> LiquidDemocracy: Also, that.
[14:53] <LiquidDemocracy> thx
[14:53] <sgtkilljoy> LiquidDemocracy: openjdk

[14:55] <sote> the police would laugh at me and say what is said on the internet is heresay
[14:55] <sote> anyways, materr soon to be forgotten about
[14:55] <DWSR> sote: I would recommend just ignoring it if it's just a one-off.
[14:56] <sote> it was mangoix that made the threat
[14:56] <vulte> sote: if it's an actual literal threat i.e. "i'm going to come and hurt you" the police would take it seriously in my experience
[14:57] <sote> so I can block people on this thing aye
[14:57] <sote> cool
[14:57] <ThinkT510> sote: sure, /ignore nickthatyouwanttoingnore

[14:59] <faLUCE> ubuntu 12.10
[15:00] <kevinmthomas> its 12.04 i think 32 bit
[15:00] <vulte> ThinkT510: I have multi-monitors and needed to use the "put" function from Compiz to allow me to use flash full-screen on monitor 2. Compiz could be the issue, unsure
[15:00] <ThinkT510> vulte: oh, flash and 2 monitors, out of my league sorry
[15:00] <bilel> OerHeks: do you mean "left shift" + "@" when the pc boots?

[15:01] <vulte> ThinkT510: no problem, thanks for your time :)
[15:01] <ThinkT510> bilel: there are 2 shift keys on your keyboard, hold the one to your left while it boots
[15:02] <bhavesh> can I upgrade the kernel of already installed Ubuntu from a live USB?
[15:02] <vulte> i always forget the name of 12.10..last I used ubuntu seriously was hoary :P oh well
[15:02] <ThinkT510> bhavesh: not sure why you would want to. having network problems?
[15:03] <DWSR> bhavesh: Yes, you can upgrade the kernel from an installed Ubuntu.
[15:03] <ThinkT510> !12.10 | vulte
[15:03] <ubottu> vulte: Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) is the current stable release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.10/ - Release notes: http://ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/12.10 - Support in #ubuntu
[15:03] <bhavesh> ThinkT510: well its showing kernel panic
[15:03] <DWSR> ThinkT510: Even if you are, you could download the packages to your installed distro, then trigger the upgrade.
[15:03] <vulte> thinkt510: Yeah I looked it up :P thanks
[15:03] <ThinkT510> DWSR: hence why i asked about his network
[15:04] <bilel> ThinkT510: ok, but why isn't it showing up by default? I don't really like the fact that I have to always keep in mind "press shift" as soon as I boot my computer otherwise it'll default to windows. I remember with ubuntu 11.04 it was showing up by default, but apparently not with 11.10
[15:04] <bhavesh> DWSR: well I cannot boot into the installed ubuntu, so I was trying to use the live usb for upgrading the kernel
[15:04] <root_____> how to give ipaddress+portnumber a hostname e.g: 192.168.1.2:8000 localhost.com any solution?

=== root_____ is now known as Ail
[15:04] <DWSR> !hosts | root_____

[15:06] <ubottu> Ail, please see my private message
[15:06] <bhavesh> DWSR: if I follow those commands, then it will upgrade the kernel of ubuntu installed on usb, right?
[15:07] <Ail> DWSR: i already tried it in hosts file but only ipaddress work fine but when i give portnumber withipaddress thn its not working
[15:08] <DWSR> Ail: You can't assign portnumbers.
[15:08] <DWSR> Ail: You'll have to do localhost.com:port
[15:08] <Ail> DWSR: any other way
[15:08] <Ail> ?
[15:08] <DWSR> no.
[15:08] <DWSR> That's how DNS works.

=== OpenSource is now known as Guest97257
[15:08] <DWSR> vulte: Yes.
[15:09] <DWSR> Means the kernel module isn't installed
[15:09] <vulte> what is the package name so i can install it?
[15:09] <vulte> i'm on quantal if it matters
[15:09] <sgo11> DWSR, I solved the problem by installing libid3-tools and then run "id3convert -s file.mp3".
[15:09] <DWSR> sgo11: Awesome, good to know.

[15:11] <k1l_> vulte: is there a reaason you dont use the driver ubuntu ships?
[15:12] <vulte> k1l_: Having issues with text pixelation and distortion with stock open-source driver. Maybe related to Compiz from what I've learned

[15:12] <DWSR> Whatever they call the proprietary blob.
[15:13] <yeats> fglrx
[15:13] <disharmonic> Quick question, Can i symlink to a NTFS partition?
[15:13] <k1l_> it just i saw some of those missing kernel header failures lately.
[15:13] <k1l_> all with the .deb paackage
[15:13] <DWSR> disharmonic: Yes, if you wan tto divide by 0.
[15:13] <DWSR> disharmonic: What exactly are you trying to do?
[15:14] <yeats> k1l_: I've seen the same problem with virtualbox (from the vbox repo) - looks like 'linux-headers' is not listed as a dependency (though it actually is)
[15:14] <vulte> k1l_ + yeats: it now worked correctly with those kernel headers. thank you to both!
[15:14] <vulte> wish me luck, I'm going to reboot..
[15:14] <k1l_> vulte:
[15:14] <DWSR> good luck.
[15:14] <k1l_> is there a reason you are not running the newest kernel build?
=== n is now known as Guest53738
[15:15] <k1l_> -22 seems the latest build in the 12,10 repo
[15:15] <disharmonic> DWSR, i'm a bit short on space on my EXT4 drive as i never allocated space for games. With the Steam beta i'm runnin out of space fast. I was thinking to symlink steams games folder to my NTFS partition
[15:15] <DWSR> disharmonic: I would definitely NOT do that.
[15:15] <DWSR> But it's certainly possible.
[15:15] <vulte> k1l_: didn't realize that. I think I'll get the driver stable on what I have right now then update and fix it
[15:15] <yeats> disharmonic: yeah, you don't want to do that
[15:16] <disharmonic> yeats k11 there's a metapackage that gets the latest headers and source.
[15:16] <DWSR> disharmonic: As long as you have a method of reading and writing to NTFS partitions (ntfs-3g, or built in ntfs support in the kernel), you can symlink to whatever.
[15:16] <yeats> disharmonic: yep
[15:16] <k1l_> vulte: yes, just keep in mind to reinstall the driver after a kernel upgrade (if dkms doesnt do the job)
[15:16] <DWSR> k1l_: dkms should do it, from my personal experience.

[15:19] <Ray> try to use the LTS ver. like 12.04 for more further assistance bro~
[15:19] <disharmonic> DWSR, yeats so symlinking to NTFS could potentially lead to filesystem issues?
[15:19] <SourceSlayer> It's covering a part of the screen but I can still click on things under it, is there any way to get rid of it without logging out?
[15:19] <DWSR> disharmonic: No.
[15:19] <DWSR> disharmonic: It could potentially lead to you corrupting your Steam install.
[15:20] <DWSR> disharmonic: ntfs rw support is pretty stable these days.

[15:23] <vulte> okay. how do i stop and start x before and after doing that then? sorry, new-ish to ubuntu
[15:23] <DWSR> vulte: First thing, pop open a terminal and check the output of 'xrandr -q'

[15:34] <dcope> Hm, only mentions 7.1 on the link yeats got the bot to write.  I guess it'll work.
[15:34] <disharmonic> DWSR,  also removing the core package should force all its depending packages to uninstall as well

[15:36] <DWSR> disharmonic: Can I remove X?
[15:36] <DWSR> disharmonic: By just doing apt-get remove x*?
[15:37] <disharmonic> DWSR, that would remove all packages starting with x. Not recommended
[15:37] <DWSR> lol
[15:37] <disharmonic> although apt-get probable wouldn't be able to do it anyway
[15:37] <DWSR> X server is provided by xorg, correct?
[15:38] <vulte> More issues, hope you guys don't mind..I installed compiz packages and rebooted and that's when the display issues started. those are fixed with new AMD driver, but keycommands set in CompizConfig are not functioning. I'm not entirely sure compiz is actually on

[15:43] <cableordsl> hello guys i need your advice, it seems like a simple question, but im about to change from a dsl to cable provider, and i wonder whether the ip change is as easy peasy with JDownloader afterwards, goolging the problem leaves me bewildered....
[15:43] <DarkSnow> il y a quelqu'un ?
[15:43] <disharmonic> vulte, not sure. Why would you even want to do that. Mutter is faster than compiz

[15:44] <vulte> disharmonic: you're right. let me put it this way. To be able to place full-screen flash on monitor 2, i need a key combination that will move the current window to the next monitor. Compiz is the way I thought to do that. is it possible, then, do do something like that with mutter?

[16:21] <vulte> cableordsl: in my experience, if you aren't set up with a static IP from your provider, simply power-cycling your modem will give you a new IP
[16:21] <disharmonic> ThinkT510, wildNBK  i find Cinnamon provides a relativly similar experience
[16:21] <vulte> cableordsl: if you aren't sure, ask the cable provider in question

[16:22] <cableordsl> vulte, i think its clear that i will have a static ip, that i m pretty sure of

[16:22] <disharmonic> ThinkT510, obviously. I don't see why it shouldn't be mentioned though
[16:22] <ThinkT510> wildNBK: of course, check privacy settings
[16:22] <k1l_> cableordsl: that is a topic for the offtopic channel. (like mentioned before)
[16:22] <vulte> cableordsl: Ask the cable provider if they can set you up with a dynamic then
[16:22] <cableordsl> vulte, do you think i will have a chance with no programming knowledge to change my ip then (with JD) in this case?
[16:22] <disharmonic> cableordsl, static IP usually means it doesnt change. at all
[16:23] <wildNBK> lol, that easy... thanks!

[16:46] <vulte> kostkon: That blank screen was that I was thinking. I want the screens to stay on fulltime
[16:46] <jrtappers> lasers, The monitor works (Tested in 7), it shows a black screen apart from showing the alt+ctrl+f* termianls and the shutdown animation

[17:22] <jrtappers> damselfly9, I have the pci id, I want to start a second X session
[17:22] <damselfly9> jrtrappers; the only way you could do that is within a virtual machine
[17:23] <lasers> jrtappers: No idea!
[17:23] <jrtappers> damselfly9, no other way?
[17:24] <damselfly9> jrtrappers; the first copy of X will be taking control of your mouse and keyboard
[17:24] <adamk>  jrtappers: Why not create an xorg.conf file that specifies the drivers for all your GPU devices in one spot?  Then running X will run it on both devices.
[17:24] <jrtappers> adamk, That would be ideal
[17:25] <kovu> when i try to print nothing happens
[17:26] <jrtappers> adamk, problem is that I'm using the AMD beta drivers, and that was hard for me to work out
[17:26] <jrtappers> adamk, Im not very good at complex config files
[17:26] <damselfly9> kovu; I wish I could be of moe help, but I don't have hardware like yours to experiment with
[17:26] <adamk> You are going to have a very very difficult time getting Xorg to use the proprietary drivers on one GPU and open source drivers with any other GPU.
[17:26] <adamk> It may not even be possible, honestly.

[17:28] <jrtappers> vulte, press the power button briefly
[17:28] <jrtappers> vulte, it will pop up
[17:28] <adamk> jrtappers: I wouldn't try.  If I wanted to use different drivers on different GPUs, I'd stick with all open source drivers.  That's your best chance of getting it to work.
[17:29] <jasunto> just curious if any has ubuntu 12.10 64bit desktop running on a PC with two nvidia cards in SLI?

[17:31] <jasunto_> Yup
[17:31] <jrtappers> adamk, Have it as a permenant terminal window on that screen
[17:32] <damselfly9> jrtrappers; so this is all about running games? Why not have two xorg.conf files, one which specifies the opensource drivers and the other which specifies the proprietary drivers? you could switch between xorg.conf files based on whether you want games or general usage
[17:32] <adamk> damselfly9: The problem with that is that the proprietary drivers use a different libglx...
[17:32] <zykotick9> adamk: regarding your GPU open driver comment.  i've read you "can't" simultaniously run nvidia/ati propritary drivers...
[17:32] <jrtappers> damselfly9, Sounds like a good idea, but how?
[17:32] <adamk> damselfly9: And a different kernel module.
[17:33] <adamk> damselfly9: So it would require rebooting between switching drivers.
[17:33] <adamk> zykotick9: That is correct.
[17:33] <jrtappers> OK, so can I keep TTY going?
[17:33] <henkka> Hello, could someone help me a bit. i have external monitor connected to my laptop. but cant set its resolution. its same as laptops
[17:33] <damselfly9> rebooting between games vs general usage wouldn't be too terrible
[17:33] <vulte> henkka: are you mirroring the laptop's screen on the monitor or extending it?
[17:34] <jrtappers> adamk, damselfly9, zykotick9  Ok, workaround, can I keep TTY going whilst im on ctrl+alt+f7?
[17:34] <henkka> vulte, oh that helped.. thanks :D
[17:34] <vulte> henkka: np :)
[17:34] <damselfly9> jrtrappers; you can set ubuntu to boot to text instead of to X, then you can switch xorg.conf files without rebooting
[17:35] <jrtappers> Ok, so how would I do all of this?
[17:35] <henkka> or didnt.. now i have apps on my laptop and empty desktop on monitor :D
[17:35] <damselfly9> with a lot of effort. but to run games is worth it to the true gamer :)
[17:35] <jaco> I have Macbook Pro with always ubuntu, of course and both the sound and video go jumping when I connect hdmi to TV. Anybody knows what is happening?. Thank you in advance :-)
[17:36] <henkka> and mouse only moves on laptop monitor
[17:36] <damselfly9> jrtrappers; first step, setup for boot to text
[17:37] <jrtappers> damselfly9, how long to set it up, roughly?
[17:37] <damselfly9> less time than a night of halo, if everything goes well
[17:37] <jrtappers> Ok
[17:38] <jrtappers> damselfly9, Ok, should I backup my current config? (And how?)
[17:39] <damselfly9> jrtrappers; backing up is always good
[17:39] <jrtappers> damselfly9, can we try using propietery and open source, just to see, with backup there is nothing lost if it goes wrong
[17:41] <damselfly9> jrtrappers; so for steps- (1) set for boot to text (2) make sure both drivers are installed (3) generate 2 xorg.conf files, one for each driver

[17:43] <kovu> please can someone tell me how to innstall the driver for my bj-10sx printer
[17:43] <evalic> thank you that was what i wanted to do as well.  just  mine tf
[17:43] <keelG> Kovu - have you tried using a generic PCL or PS driver?
[17:43] <henkka> my desktop comp keeps freezing / crashing, could try if its hdd problem as i have extra laptop one. already tried windows / linux, 3 diffrent gpu, diffrent memorys.. 2 diffrent psu. all i can think its mobo problem or hdd
[17:43] <greenbarel> @henkka yes you can, if you have 2.5 external hard drive you can diskonect it and connest that from your laptop
[17:44] <bekks> henkka: Then check the hdd status.
[17:44] <kovu> no
[17:44] <kovu> what are those
[17:44] <henkka> with ubuntu it usually either hard crashed at startup. or freeze when doing something
[17:44] <kovu> i want to try to install a ppd driver
[17:45] <kovu> but dont know how to
[17:45] <mainklain> thx anyway
[17:45] <henkka> really old dekstop tho.. so could be mobo problem
[17:45] <jrtappers> henkka, run SMART
[17:46] <henkka> hmm havent tried that yet
[17:46] <henkka> what does that do? :p
[17:46] <jrtappers> henkka, will tell you if the HDD is in good shape
[17:46] <jrtappers> go to disks
[17:46] <damselfly9> jrtrappers; I need to be offline for an hour for hardware maintenance
[17:46] <jaco> anybody can hear me?. am I visible?
[17:46] <bekks> !smart | henkka
[17:47] <kovu> yes jaco we see you
[17:47] <jrtappers> !smart | jrtappers
[17:47] <jaco> oh, thanks
[17:47] <bekks> henkka: The package you need is called smartctl
[17:47] <jrtappers> henkka, No
[17:47] <jaco> im newbie
[17:47] <jrtappers> bekks, you can do it with preinstalled utils
[17:47] <kovu> same here
[17:47] <bekks> jrtappers: Tell me how that utility is named when it is not smartctl.
[17:47] <henkka> already dried some surface scan program, but it didnt found anything
[17:48] <bekks> jrtappers: There are no other tools which are able to test the SMART capabilities.
[17:48] <henkka> have to try that out when i have patience.. been pulling my hair off for about 2 days with that desktop comp
[17:48] <jrtappers> bekks, what about disks?  click the settings on the top right in it
[17:49] <bekks> jrtappers: Which just reads the smart info but is NOT able to run SMART tests.
=== maximus is now known as Guest55578
[17:49] <bekks> jrtappers: At least without an installed smartctl
[17:49] <jaco> so, nobody knows how help me
[17:49] <jrtappers> bekks, if its a dependency of a preinstalled package then it should be already installed
[17:50] <bekks> jrtappers: Which technically doesnt change what I said.
[17:51] <kovu> how do i install my ppd driver for my printer
[17:51] <jrtappers> bekks, we are areguing over two ways of doing the same thing, so we are both right, argument over, abck to useful things

[17:53] <jrtappers> Is there an easy way to add a device to Xorg config?
[17:53] <gherkin> hello
[17:53] <gogo4> hi
[17:53] <bekks> jaco: Please dont suggest that,since that restarts the X server and does NOT care about closing open files, etc.
[17:54] <RollinV2> jrib bekks i was curious about it. mainly for refreshing if a gui related package is updated.
[17:54] <gherkin> bekks: what do you suggest?
[17:54] <jrib> it's not even the right key sequence and it's been disabled for a while by default too :)
[17:54] <RollinV2> jaco, thanks. i will try that.
[17:54] <bekks> gherkin: I suggest saving your documents, and logging out properly :)
[17:54] <gherkin> does anyone want to hear a joke?
[17:54] <jrib> gherkin: #ubuntu-offtopic please
[17:54] <hplc> is there any generally accepted certification program for linux? or each distro went their own way?
[17:54] <bekks> RollinV2: That will kill your X-server - you have been warned.
[17:55] <gogo4> gherkin: sounds like fun
[17:55] <gherkin> jrib: it's an ubuntu related joke though
[17:55] <jrib> RollinV2: jaco's suggestion won't work.  It's not the right key sequence.  ctrl-alt-backspace did used to restart the X server (but wouldn't take care to ask you nicely about saving your work) but that's been disabled by default for a while now.  It's not what you want
[17:55] <jrib> gherkin: great, that's what #ubuntu-offtopic is for!  #ubuntu is for support
[17:55] <gherkin> oh :(

[17:58] <konraddo> hi, someone asked me for help (how to list all files in current folder which name ends on 't' and order those files by date. i guess it'll be "ls *t -lrt", but unfortunatelly currently i don't have any linux installed to test it and i cannot find my pendrive with ubuntu. can somebody tell me if this is a proper command?
[17:58] <jrib> konraddo: it's not
[17:59] <jrib> konraddo: erm, maybe it is.  I thought -r was same as -R but I'm wrong
[18:00] <jrib> konraddo: in any case, you'll still be listing the contents of directories.  It depends on what you want to do exactly
[18:00] <konraddo> you mean that it would list not only files in current folder, but also files that are in subfolders of current folder?
[18:01] <jrib> konraddo: sure.  If you have a folder named "foldert", you will get the contents of foldert as output
[18:01] <shayde> Hey guys I'm trying to partition my HD through the ubuntu installation, how would I go about doing that on 12.10?
[18:01] <shayde> I have windows 7 already installed
[18:01] <konraddo> ok, thanks
[18:02] <compdoc> shayde, their used to be an 'alternative' version of the installer for that
[18:02] <shayde> really now?
[18:03] <jrib> compdoc: the normal installer allows partitioning too, doesn't it?
[18:03] <shayde> jrib thats what I thought too...
[18:04] <shayde> jrib you select "something else" after selecting ur language
[18:04] <shayde> I'm just trying to figure out how to partition from there.
[18:05] <compdoc> shayde, I dont see the alternative for 12.10. Just 12.04. I know the Ubuntu Server d/l allows partition setup, including LVM
[18:06] <kovu> how do i make myself the root
[18:06] <compdoc> kovu, use the command sudo
[18:06] <yeats> !sudo | kovu
[18:06] <ubottu> kovu: sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information.

[19:29] <_helios_> JPeterson, what do you mean by bottom bar?
[19:30] <bekks> justin11: huh?
[19:30] <JPeterson> a bar thats on the bottom (of the desktop)
[19:30] <JPeterson> gray
[19:30] <_helios_> hmm what version of Ubuntu?
[19:30] <JPeterson> probably added in 12.04 or 12.10
[19:30] <_helios_> JPeterson, no it's not been added because I don't have a bottom bar.
[19:30] <ThinkT510> JPeterson: by default there is no bottom bar in unity
[19:31] <JPeterson> around 100 px high
[19:31] <JPeterson> it has a backup notification icon to the right
[19:32] <kostkon> JPeterson, there is no such thing in ubuntu since 11.04
[19:32] <_helios_> Well this is off topic but I have these two small solar panels they put out about 6volts when I wire them in series in direct sunlight just 1 volt to much to charge my ipod ;(

[19:38] <Plumblum> okey so this is a really fun problem, just typing shutdown closes my ssh connection but the computer refuses to poweroff but when using shutdown -h it turns off. what could that little fun problem be ?
[19:39] <bekks> Plumblum: Thats no problem but intended behaviour. :)
[19:39] <ThinkT510> Plumblum: man shutdown
[19:39] <Plumblum> o.O
[19:39] <epitamizor> just use init 0
[19:39] <Plumblum> but it refuses to let me back in :P
[19:39] <RollinV2> user permissions
[19:39] <Plumblum> so what could the purpouse be
[19:39] <bekks> epitamizor: Which is what shutdown is calling.
[19:39] <bekks> Plumblum: Take a look at the "-h" option of shutdown.
[19:40] <bekks> RollinV2: Wrong :)
=== 64MACMJ6G is now known as essomba84
[19:40] <Plumblum> i know it stands for halat/poweroff
[19:40] <Plumblum> but that is what an "ordinary" shutdown should do
[19:40] <bekks> Plumblum: Not according to the man page. :)
[19:40] <Plumblum> since i cant get back on it after shutdown i have to pull the plugg or hold the powerbutton
[19:41] <bekks> Plumblum: Because ommiting the -h option just brings a system down butr does NOT power off NOR reboots it. Thats intended behaviour.
[19:42] <Plumblum> huh
[19:42] <Plumblum> just thought it was some strange bug :P
[19:42] <damselfly9> bekks; I've always found -h will power it off if acpi is enabled
[19:42] <RollinV2> bekks, its correct for server shutdowns :-) .. but on a desktop you are right. permissions won't matter.
[19:42] <bekks> Plumblum: So if you want it to be powered off, use -h
[19:42] <Plumblum> why would i want to bring down a system ?
[19:42] <bekks> damselfly9: Thats what -h is for.
[19:42] <Plumblum> if i forget -h how do i safley turn it off
[19:42] <Plumblum> since it just sits there
[19:42] <bekks> Plumblum: Pull the plug.
[19:42] <Guest25158> hi peoples !
[19:42] <Plumblum> thats a strange behaviour xD
[19:43] <Plumblum> if you ask me atleast
[19:43] <bekks> Plumblum: Thats intended and well described in the man page.
[19:43] <user1> hi
[19:43] <epitamizor> having it off but not truely off keeps the comp warm
[19:43] <damselfly9> Plumblum; maybe have it on a powerstrip with a switch?
[19:43] <Guest25158> how OS ubuntu will good for me, than i have 2500GHz(bartron)/2Gb-ram ?

[19:44] <justin11> can i have created an example configuration file that we will be using for the rest of this article and Download it? yes or no?
[19:44] <bekks> Plumblum: Well, then it is a bug since the invention of UNIX.

[19:52] <JPeterson> ThinkT510: it isn't. i didn't interpret that you asked what to tell me in connection with that
[19:52] <deadbeef> Walex: no problem, i basically had a power outage and java started crashing after that; the ram seems to be ok, so maybe it's the files
[19:52] <deadbeef> i'm installing debsums, let's see
[19:52] <damselfly9> deadbeef; are you running it from a ssd?

[19:54] <ThinkT510> JPeterson: what do you want me to tell you? you asked how to move a window thats partially off-screen, i told you to use alt+click and drag, somehow it doesn't work for you then you mention goldilocks

[19:55] <hhhzzzain> Jpeterson: Press Alt key then left-click on the window, it allows you to move the window up and down.

[19:56] <JPeterson> hhhzzzain: there's no such fucntion for any window
[19:56] <hhhzzzain> jpeterson: if that does not work, right-click in the title bar of and choose "move"
[19:57] <hhhzzzain> jpeterson: then you should be able to move the window once the "hand" icon appears.

[20:00] <JPeterson> hhhzzzain: the windows only have a close button (rather than also minimize and restore)
[20:00] <dr_willis> Hmm... the alt-click ANYWHERE ON A Window to drag it.. was a feature of every window manager ive ever used.. actually i think its a feature of X.
[20:00] <hhhzzzain> jpeterson: I entered the room a few minutes ago, what is your problem again?
[20:01] <ThinkT510> JPeterson: you're not trying to alt+click drag a window thats maximised are you?
[20:01] <JPeterson> no "minimize window" "maximize window" button on windows
[20:02] <hhhzzzain> jpeterson: oh ok, I remember that you could add those and pick which buttons to show at the "window" settings area.
[20:02] <hhhzzzain> jpeterson: I am not currently on ubuntu and can not direct you where you can find that settings.
[20:03] <damselfly9> JPeterson; what if you just close the window and try again?
[20:04] <hhhzzzain> jpeterson: you can fix that. but if you need to immediately minimize or maximize windows, right-click on the title bar (the top part of windows) and it should show options to minimize, maximize, move, close, others ...
[20:05] <hhhzzzain> jpeterson: some particular windows do not have maximize such as the settings. But you are saying all windows (file browser, internet, etc) do not have minimize and maximize buttons?

[20:17] <henkka> theres no install button or anything

[20:18] <damselfly9> jrtappers; I think X needs to use a file called "xorg.conf" if there is one. But you could have a shell script to "cp xorg.conf.1 xorg.conf" or "cp xorg.conf.2 xorg.conf"

[20:47] <newphreak> Hello, when i log in via ssh, ubuntu sais there is 6 security updates, but apt-get upgrade has no new packages
[20:47] <newphreak> so what and where are these 6 security updates?
[20:48] <newphreak> I am by the way running ubuntu server 12.04.1 LTS
[20:48] <lazers> jrtappers: "man xorg.conf" -- I see it under Section "InputDevice" -- Try that?
[20:48] <ThinkT510> !dist-upgrade | newphreak
[20:48] <ubottu> newphreak: A dist-upgrade will install new dependencies for packages already installed and may remove packages if they are no longer needed. This will not bring you to a new release of Ubuntu, see !upgrade if that is your intention.
[20:48] <newphreak> ThinkT510: oh, dist-upgrade is a little different then on other distrobutions then :) thanks
[20:49] <newphreak> now i know what to look for
[20:49] <newphreak> !upgrade
[20:49] <ubottu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade

[20:51] <funkymonk> How do I check what character encoding my filesystem is using?
[20:52] <damselfly9> jrtappers; this has directions for generating one xorg.conf, you'd do it once while the proprietary drivers are configured, then switch to the opensource and do it againhttp://www.ehow.com/how_8521031_create-xorgconf-ubuntu.html
[20:53] <chase> ping admin ?

[21:11] <JPeterson> 14.4
[21:12] <bekks> 14.4 isnt released yet :P
[21:12] <hhhzzzain> jpeterson, if 12.10 then you have to install another desktop package "xfce" or "xubuntu-desktop"
[21:13] <damselfly9> JPeterson is back from the future :)
[21:13] <JPeterson> hhhzzzain: because startx enters non-unity gnome i suspect i can start it from inside x

[21:16] <damselfly9> I guess skynet can assign any version numbers it wants
[21:16] <keelG> @Yrao014 - check this out for "seamless app RDP" or RemoteApp as MS calls it: http://askubuntu.com/questions/148159/remmina-remoteapp-over-rdp
[21:16] <Wug> OK, so. I've got a website that loads in one browser and not in chromium
[21:16] <keelG> You can make RDP display only application
[21:16] <keelG> also :)
[21:17] <Wug> the website uses https and has a self signed certificate, but I don't get to the warning page, it gives me error 2 (Unknown Error)
[21:17] <Wug> I've tried clearing cache and browsing data and all that, and reinstalling the browser hasn't fixed it either
[21:17] <Wug> is there a magic command I can run to force reconfigure a package and all of its dependencies?
[21:18] <yaro014> keelG: your the man !, big thanx for that  :), this is exactly what I'm looking for. I just need to run RSAT for active directory. Big thanx again
[21:18] <damselfly9> Wug; are you sure that site isn't checking for browser useragent strings and making an exception of chromium?
[21:18] <Wug> it was working until some update in the recent past

[21:22] <Wug> jaco: have you checked the cable?  I heard something the other day that such problems can be caused by the obnoxious drm scheme HDMI uses not working quite correctly on substandard cables

[21:38] <hurleyman> kostkon, thankyou.  I came across that this morning and read up on the install.  looks simple enough.
[21:38] <Wug> I'm not sure how much if any stuff they share between them

[21:38] <keelG> I am +1 with Wug
[21:38] <hurleyman> kostkon, messed with amahi at all?
[21:39] <Wug> .NET applications are not strictly executables, so mono is probably just an implementation of the .NET framework

[22:08] <Gleaker> it auto selected it i guess
[22:08] <damselfly9> Gleaker; you need a 64 bit cpu to run 64 bit linux
[22:08] <keelG> Gleaker: AMD64 is if your cpu supports the x86_64 architecture

[22:12] <k1l_> Gleaker: it is the 64bit version. the patent was invented by amd so its called amd64. but its for intel cpus, too
[22:13] <keelG> Gleaker: i386/i686 is 32bit, and AMD64 is 64bit - if you have a computer from this decade - you should be able to run AMD64 just fine

[22:35] <souperk> the command "sudo update-grup" is important? or can I just boot the machine after the modification?
[22:35] <damselfly9> souperk; might be safer to comment it out than remove it altogether, so you don't forget where it went
[22:35] <souperk> *sudo update-grub *sorry
[22:36] <ring0> souperk, no you need to run the command afterwards or your adjustment will have no effect
[22:37] <jwrigley> Gnonthgol, Do you want it? Depends what version of Ubuntu you are running. A repository (repo for short) is the place from which ubuntu installs software. The updates repo contains recommended updates to software, precise-updates repo contains recommended updates for Ubuntu Precise Pangolin
[22:37] <ring0> damselfly9, how is he supposed to comment out splash in this line? GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
[22:38] <souperk> nice statement!
[22:38] <souperk> maybe i can just put // in front of the line like i do in php files?
[22:38] <damselfly9> by copying the whole original line to a comment
[22:38] <keelG> tb01110100: It sounds like your machine doesn't want to boot the USB for one reason or the other. Does the USB boot on other machines, and are you using UEFI boot (Win8 certified machines)=
[22:38] <ring0> damselfly9, that would work
[22:39] <tb01110100> keelG: It's a W7.
[22:39] <ring0> souperk, uncommenting is done with a #
[22:39] <keelG> tb01110100: can you boot the USB on another machine?
[22:39] <dcope> hey all
[22:39] <dcope> all of the sudden my 12.04 install is freaking out... it's like there is an input device clicking as fast as possible on my machine
[22:39] <jwrigley> In ubuntu jar-files can be executed if java is installed and the executable bit is set. Anyone know how that happens?
[22:39] <dcope> any ideas?
[22:39] <Gnonthgol> jwrigley: I too have read the docs, but what exactly does recommended updates mean, is it major versions, minor versions or just patches, can it cause the system to become unstable?
[22:40] <souperk> I can put a line above that one with #GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
[22:40] <tb01110100> keelG: BRB
[22:40] <souperk> so that I can still see how it was the original? is it ok?
[22:40] <damselfly9> yes
[22:40] <JokesOnYou77> HI all, I'm getting a duplicate sources message when I run apt-get update and I think it has something to do with an extra Partners repo entry added by the software center, has anyone seen this before?
[22:40] <keelG> jwrigley: java -jar /path/to/jar.file
[22:41] <damselfly9> dcope; what is it doing at a rapid rate?
[22:41] <Gnonthgol> jwrigley: the kernel have options to register executors in userspace, when the kernel tries to run something that is not a shell file or an elf file it runs java
[22:42] <dcope> damselfly9: it is hard to describe
[22:42] <dcope> damselfly9: i right click on the desktop, and new folder is atuomatically selected
[22:42] <dcope> by the time the right click is over, the new folder is also clicked like 15 times
[22:42] <dcope> so now i have a bunch of open folders
[22:43] <tb01110100> keelG: Now that you mention it, No. :)
[22:43] <dcope> i think the sixaxis driver is cuasing it
[22:43] <damselfly9> dcope; does it keep doing that? or does it only happen when you right click?
[22:44] <keelG> tb01110100: That might be the root cause then ;) Use unetbootin, if you already tried that or it still fails - try to repartition/format the USB drive
[22:44] <dcope> damselfly9: it keeps doing it
[22:44] <dcope> for instance, i just clicked my user name in the top right of unity and it auto selected "Swithc User"
[22:44] <damselfly9> dcope; can you try a different mouse?
[22:44] <dcope> damselfly9: i have
[22:44] <dcope> damselfly9: i tried usb mouse and now i am over VNC
[22:45] <damselfly9> dcope; that's messed up alright
[22:45] <dcope> indeed
[22:45] <dcope> i removed the sixaxis driver but it's still happening
[22:45] <JokesOnYou77> Does anyone know why the software-center lists an extra Partners source that is "Added by Software-Center" and if it's safe to uncheck it?
[22:45] <damselfly9> what about a different usb port?
[22:45] <dcope> damselfly9: i tried vnc too and it does it
[22:45] <dcope> with the mouse unplugged
[22:45] <Gnonthgol> dcope: I hope you have checked the obvious and unplugged all the usb connections to see if there is another mouse hidden away
[22:46] <dcope> yes
[22:46] <damselfly9> weird
[22:46] <dcope> it only happens after login all
[22:46] <dcope> i use the mouse at the login screen just fine. i log into my account and bam, it happens
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest20876
[22:47] <damselfly9> dcope; do have have any remote desktop options enabled?
[22:47] <RollinV2> JokesOnYou77, thats for software like dropbox vlc etc if i recall correctly. its safe to leave it on.
[22:47] <dcope> argh this is annoying
[22:47] <dcope> damselfly9: none, im doing vnc over ssh
[22:47] <jwrigley> Gnonthgol, precise-updates are considered to be stable, but as with any change it may introduce instability. Depending on the instability a new version will appear in either precise-security or again in precise-updates
[22:47] <samo_svoj> I have a quuestion regarding default UI - currently it is Unity but entering into mobile phone market Ubuntu plans to use Qt for UI. Does it mean Ubuntu have plans to switch to KDE as default UI in future?
[22:48] <dcope> is there a way to unload x drivers?
[22:48] <jwrigley> Gnonthgol, does that mean there is a kernel flag to activate java?
[22:48] <dcope> or just reload the stock ubu x mouse driver?
[22:48] <dr_willis> you can use qt without kde
[22:48] <dcope> over ssh
[22:48] <JokesOnYou77> RollinV2, I think it's causing a duplicate sources entry: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1574253/
[22:48] <JokesOnYou77> *Error
[22:49] <damselfly9> dcope; this only happened after you installed sixaxis?
[22:49] <folorn> could someone explain to me how to Add repositories from terminal please i forget " I've already imported the key so everything should be good just forgot the command all repos are debs too as well"?
[22:49] <dcope> damselfly9: yes. "sixad" package. but i removed it and rebooted
[22:49] <samo_svoj> dr_willis: of course you can, but it is more complex from developers perspective to mix GTK+ and Qt
[22:49] <dr_willis> samo_svoj: i belive some ubuntu apps are allready using qt. i foget what ones
[22:50] <dcope> damselfly9: so it only happens when i click
[22:50] <dcope> i can mouse over a folder and it doesn't open
[22:50] <dcope> but if i click it once to select it, like 10 new windows open
[22:50] <samo_svoj> dr_willis: does it means ubuntu is leaving GTK+?
[22:50] <damselfly9> dcope; apparently it left unremoved entries in the config files. you could try reinstalling the normal mouse package, that might reset things
[22:50] <Gnonthgol> jwrigley: look up binfmt_misc
[22:50] <kostkon> dr_willis, ubuntu one client
[22:50] <dcope> damselfly9: xserver-xorg-input-mouse ?
[22:51] <damselfly9> any normal mouse package
[22:51] <dr_willis> samo_svoj: no idea.  could be they used qt for tge u1 client to make it more portable
[22:52] <jwrigley> Gnonthgol, thanks, will do.
[22:52] <dcope> damselfly9:  how can i open an x application over ssh?
[22:52] <dcope> i want to open xev
[22:53] <hehateme> how do u use mono and wine together?
[22:53] <damselfly9> I don't know, I never use ssh
[22:53] <keelG> you dont
[22:53] <dcope> on os x we have `open` which will launch a program on the host machine
[22:53] <kevinmthomas> ssh is the way to go  telnet is dead except for port testing
[22:53] <dcope> on debian it seems that an x error is just spat out when trying to launch an x program over ssh
[22:54] <hehateme> so how do u use an exe that requires netframe work plus wine?
[22:54] <dcope> the only way is if you're on the host machine which makes no sense
[22:54] <JokesOnYou77> Can anyone give me a hand with a duplicate sources error? there's no duplicate source I can find in sources.list http://paste.ubuntu.com/1574253/
[22:54] <keelG> dcope: do you want to open the application on the remote system or on the host from which you are initiatiing the tunnel?
[22:54] <dr_willis> use xhost in the remote box to allow access. rhen export the display frim the ssh sessiin
[22:54] <dcope> keelG: open it on the host machine
[22:54] <kostkon> hehateme, latest wine includes mono and uses it when loading .net apps

[22:55] <souperk> guys, deleting "splash" after quiet did not work
[22:55] <souperk> I just rebooted and the screen is still black!
[22:55] <souperk> no console messages :(
[22:55] <keelG> dcope: use ssh -Y user@remote
[22:56] <damselfly9> souperk; did you update grub before you rebooted?
[22:56] <kostkon> hehateme, to get the latest version of wine, follow the instructions here:  http://www.winehq.org/download/ubuntu
[22:56] <souperk> yes damselfly9, i did that command from the terminal console, after editing the file

[22:56] <keelG> Why would you install mono in Wine?
[22:56] <whitenoise> anyone familiar with creating headless virtual box vms on ubuntu server? I created one, installed xrdp, booted the VM, and I when I do <Ubuntu's IP>:3389 .. I get the host machine, not the VM guest as documented.
[22:56] <dcope> keelG: same thing... $xev .... xev:  unable to open display ''
[22:57] <damselfly9> souperk; you can get the same messages afterwards in a console window
[22:57] <dcope> jesus christ, is there no way to launch an x program on a machine that i am ssh'd into on ubuntu?
[22:57] <keelG> dcope: I seem to vaguely remember needing to enable something. Buuuuuut I am not sure at all
[22:58] <Gnonthgol> dcope: use the -X option in ssh
[22:58] <keelG> dcope: Its a long time since Ive done it, but it should work
[22:58] <dr_willis> dcope:  with xhost and exporting the display.. i recall its doable
[22:58] <damselfly9> dcope; yes, if the target machine's port 6000 was left open

[22:59] <dcope> i'm not trying to tunnel x to my machine!
[22:59] <Gnonthgol> dcope: assuming you have X on both the client and the server and X-Forwarding enabled in sshd.conf on your server
[22:59] <dcope> no, i don't want to forward
[22:59] <keelG> dcope: ooow, then you should listen to dr_willis

[23:00]  * washuu_de is back (gone 87766:28:00)

[23:01] <Gnonthgol> JokesOnYou77: #cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d
[23:02] <JokesOnYou77> Gnonthgol, you can't cat a directory
[23:02] <Gnonthgol> JokesOnYou77: #cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
[23:02] <Flannel> JokesOnYou77: Sorry, I meant the contents of each of those files.  Since it looks like in your sources.list, you have the partner repository enabled, and then in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/precise-partner.list, you probably also have the partner repository enabled, and there's your duplication.
[23:03] <JokesOnYou77> Gnonthgol, I bow to your superior knowledge of the shell :)
[23:03] <bloony> why doesnt the ubuntu repo have htop 1.0.2? only has 1.0.1 it seems?
[23:03] <dr_willis> !latest
[23:03] <ubottu> Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[23:03] <Flannel> bloony: What version of Ubuntu are you running?

[23:04] <JokesOnYou77> Flannel, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1574297/
[23:04] <Gnonthgol> bloony: next release will have 1.0.2
[23:04] <hehateme> kostkon thanks for the info worked out perfectly. was using an older wine.
[23:04] <bloony> Flannel: hmm.. cant remember.. where can I see that?
[23:05] <Flannel> bloony: lsb_release -a
[23:05] <bloony> Gnonthgol: okay
[23:05] <kostkon> hehateme, :)
[23:05] <bloony> Flannel: 12.10
[23:05] <Gnonthgol> JokesOnYou77: there you see duplicate lines, there should be the same lines in software centre
[23:05] <Flannel> JokesOnYou77: Yeah, the previous thing I said is the case.  You have the partner repository enabled in two places.  See line 53 here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1574277/ and 16 here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1574297/
[23:06] <Flannel> bloony: htop 1.0.2 was released in November of 2012, after 12.10 was released.  That's why it doesn't have 1.0.2, what about 1.0.2 were you hoping to have?  Features? or bug fixes?
[23:06] <ironhalik> keelG: After installing laptop-mode-tools and following wiki art on power saving, I've cut the power consumption in half :)
[23:07] <keelG> ironhalik: great stuff mate! I did some stuff like activating ASPM (be careful and test this, before enabling) it could save you as much as ~1watt - Also I made some changes to chargins tresholds of the battery to extend it lifetime
[23:08] <JokesOnYou77> Flannel, I see that now.  But I still don't understand what sources.list.d is for or why the software-center added this entry on its own.  Also, lines 16 and 17 are also duplicates if they are some how additional to sources.list
[23:08] <usr13> keelG: Where is the wiki?
[23:08]  * washuu_de is away: Away
[23:08] <Flannel> JokesOnYou77: Pretend everything in sources.list.d is appended to your sources.list, because that's basically what apt-get does.
[23:08] <ironhalik> keelG: the wiki reports ASPM should be safe to use on x220, so I enabled it too
[23:08] <keelG> usr13: ask ironhalik, I only pointed him into the direction of laptop-mode-tools
[23:09] <ironhalik> usr13: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement/PowerSavingTweaks
[23:09] <keelG> ironhalik: I am using it also on a X1C, but you should still test it :)
[23:09] <Flannel> JokesOnYou77: Yeah, both the binary and src repositories are duplicates.  I'm not sure why software center did, but simply deleting that file (sources.list.d/precise-partner.list, I imagine) should solve your problem
[23:09] <keelG> ironhalik: just by leaving your machine powered on for like 24hours or so
[23:10] <JokesOnYou77> Flannel, so should I fix this by unchecking the box in the software-center GUI or should I edit sources.list since it looks like modifications for ".d might not stick?
[23:10] <keelG> ironhalik: I am curious - what is your watt usage on a X220?
[23:11] <ironhalik> keelG: currently, on idle, about 12-13W
[23:11] <ironhalik> and with the CPU out of sleep, around 20-23
[23:11] <keelG> max brightness?
[23:12] <Flannel> JokesOnYou77: I'm not really sure.  Some of those warnings were for other files, since that contained the contents of *all* of those files.  Unchecking it in software sources *should* comment it out of sources.list, not fiddle with sources.list.d.  My first experiment would be to delete the file in the sources.list.d, open/close all of the software sources thing, and then see if it comes back (I expect it won't).

[23:15] <keelG> true, but the design of a fan is "hopeless" never the less
[23:15] <keelG> compared to the alternative presented by GE
[23:15] <Gnonthgol> keelG: laptops will always have moving parts, they just becomes smaller
[23:16] <keelG> weeeeeell
[23:16] <JokesOnYou77> Flannel, I unchecked it in the GUI and it worked!  Thanks for all the help.  And same to Gnonthgol
[23:16] <ironhalik> the x220 is silent most of the time, only under heavy load you can hear a faint fan noise
[23:16] <Gnonthgol> np
[23:16] <keelG> Gnonthgol:  There is no bearings left then :)
[23:17] <keelG> On my Thinkpad X1C fan noise or cooling is no issue - however the idea of a mechanical spinning fan is hopeless :D
[23:17] <keelG> It will die eventually
[23:17] <keelG> mostlikely before anything else
[23:18] <Gnonthgol> either the cpus will become cooler so they don't need fans, or we will have fancier cooling, or both
