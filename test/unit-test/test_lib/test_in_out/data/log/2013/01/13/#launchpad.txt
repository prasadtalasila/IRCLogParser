[08:40] <lifeless> krow: that probably indicates you have a repo (object store) but no branch(es) present there
[08:40] <lifeless> krow: that can happen if your connection is interrupted during initialisation / first time push
[08:41] <lifeless> krow: easiest solution is to push again

[18:12] <alkisg> Hi, what group do I need to be in, to access https://launchpad.net/ltsp/+edit   ?
[18:12] <alkisg> I thought that would be "ltsp drivers", but after getting an admin status there, I still can't edit the ltsp project page...
[18:28]  * alkisg guesses only the "maintainer" has access there...
[18:30] <tumbleweed> yeah
[18:33] <alkisg> Ty, we'll need to put a team there then
