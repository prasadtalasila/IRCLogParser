[00:02] <David23400> Hi , when i want to update or install VLC from software center i get a message just after typing my password which is : "The action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources"    any idea? (i'm on lubuntu)
[00:02] <escott> David23400, sounds like you are using a PPA that you havent imported the key for
[00:03] <David23400> what's PPA escott
[00:03] <escott> !ppa | David23400
[00:03] <ubottu> David23400: A Personal Package Archive (PPA) can provide alternate software not normally available in the offical Ubuntu repositories - Looking for a PPA? See https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas - WARNING: PPAs are unsupported third-party packages, and you use them at your own risk. See also !addppa and !ppa-purge
[00:03] <SierraAR> Back sorry. Who wanted me to check the smart data?
[00:04] <escott> David23400, if its not a ppa then it may just be an unsigned package in universe
[00:04] <lauratika> hi everyone does any one knows a program to add effects on a video stream lioke changing the background for cheese or other video application?
[00:04] <daftykins> SierraAR: somebody, i understand the situation though. fire up the disk utility
[00:05] <SierraAR> Disk utility is up, I'm in the smart data screen now
[00:05] <daftykins> SierraAR: any errors?
[00:05] <daftykins> or warnings
[00:05] <SierraAR> Two lines are marked as 'Failing'
[00:05] <Kion1> When I try to install Google earth from their page, the software manager says a warning that this package does not comply with the quality ... any ideas?
[00:05] <daftykins> SierraAR: uh-oh, not a reallocated sectors one, by any chance?
[00:05] <_JuJuBee> I am using an HP8600 OfficeJetPro all in one and my scanner just started not working.  xsane does not see the device.  I can still print to it fine.  I am connected via USB (for scanning) and Ethernet (for printing)  CUPS Sees my printer/fax as well.
[00:05] <SierraAR> One is 'Reallocated Sector Count' Normalized: 133; Worst: 133; Threshold: 140; Value: 561 Sectors
[00:06] <daftykins> SierraAR: yeah that drive is toast.
[00:06] <escott> SierraAR, no great surprises. the disk is toast
[00:06] <SierraAR> Lovely.
[00:06]  * daftykins high fives escott for the same word use too XD
[00:06] <SierraAR> Does this normally happen within a few months of installing a Western Digital Blue series HDD or did someone have to have fubar'd this
[00:06] <daftykins> SierraAR: if it's a drive that came with a system, it'll be warranty pursuing time with the system manufacturer
[00:06] <SierraAR> It's not the drive that came with the system
[00:07] <SierraAR> That one died months ago
[00:07] <bobolopolis> SierraAR: if the drive is under warranty, i've never had problems with getting RMA's from WD
[00:07] <escott> David23400, each package is (supposed to be) cryptographically signed to make sure that when you install it that you aren't installing malware
[00:07] <daftykins> SierraAR: some drives can die quite quick. just setup a return on wdc.com , you'll have to register with their 'force' service
[00:07] <SierraAR> And no, it's not the laptop I use :P
[00:07] <escott> SierraAR, you said it was a brand new drive right. so RMA it
[00:07] <daftykins> SierraAR: stop me if you've done RMAs before
[00:07] <SierraAR> Within the past few months, I forget when exactly we bought it. Got it new off Amazon
[00:08] <SierraAR> daftykins, I've never done one before
[00:08] <escott> SierraAR, you clearly have never worked for UPS. if you had you would know that those small hard-drive boxes make the perfect backyard footballs
[00:08] <daftykins> SierraAR: ah ok. well you can do an advanced replacement, where they ship you a new drive first and they hold the $ against your credit card until you send in the dead one.
[00:09] <SierraAR> escott, Oh god, I've heard the horror stories. I'd hoped they were just stories
[00:09] <daftykins> SierraAR: start here: http://support.wdc.com/warranty/index_end.asp?lang=en
[00:10] <daftykins> SierraAR: you could try and go back to where you bought it from, but i'd recommend just going straight to WD
[00:10] <escott> SierraAR, some are some aren't. but the failure rate is very high at the beginning then tails off and then increases again at the end. just because it passes QC doesn't mean its good. it just means its cheaper to ship X many bad units and replace them than to test all units more completely
[00:10] <_Rocky_`> Networking problem. Router is able to ping machines. Machines are not able to ping each other. Machines are laptops connected by wireless. Any ideas would be great. Thank you in advance.
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:11] <_Rocky_`> I have been banging my head over this. Had nowhere else to go :(
[00:11] <escott> _Rocky_`, are you using anything like radius?
[00:11] <SierraAR> daftykins, Bought it from amazon.com
[00:11] <daftykins> _Rocky_`: some wireless access points / routers have an option to isolate all wireless clients. has it ever worked?
[00:11] <SierraAR> Filling out the registration forms
[00:11] <daftykins> SierraAR: on amazon?
[00:11] <_Rocky_`> No. nothing special. Just a normal ubuntu 12.04 install on one lap and debian squeeze on another.
[00:12] <escott> _Rocky_`, not the laptops the router. is RADIUS enterprise WPA or isolation enabled?
[00:13] <SierraAR> daftykins, Forms on the wdc site you linked
[00:13] <_Rocky_`> daftykins: , escott : Thank you. I looked for AP Isolation on the router. There is no option. Its a basic home network model. There is no RADIUS on the router.
[00:13] <daftykins> ok cool
[00:13] <SierraAR> To create an RMA
=== qos|away is now known as qos
[00:13] <escott> _Rocky_`, and what error messages do you get? (you are pinging by ip address correct?)
[00:14] <lauratika> hey
[00:14] <lauratika> hahahaha
[00:15] <daftykins> lauratika: sorry no thoughts about webcam cheese came to mind :P
[00:15] <_Rocky_`> escott: The IP is correct. But get something like <local ip>: Destination host unreachable on both machines
[00:15] <julian-delphiki> _Rocky_`: can you show us the actual output?
[00:15] <_Rocky_`> escott: Also, arp -n shows route to router but the route to the other machine is incomplete.
[00:16] <julian-delphiki> _Rocky_`: and both machines have an appropriate route to the router and aren't getting their via magic? lol
[00:16] <usr13> _Rocky_`: nmap
[00:16] <escott> _Rocky_`, why would arp show a route to the other ip. is it not on the same subnet?
[00:16] <SierraAR> Thanks for the help btw, escott  and daftykins and whoever else said to look at the SMART status
[00:16] <daftykins> SierraAR: np :) good luck with it
[00:16] <lauratika> daftykins: or any fx for video?
[00:18] <_Rocky_`> julian-delphiki: the error "From 192.168.64.101 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable"
[00:18] <_Rocky_`> escott: The are on the same subnet.
[00:18] <SierraAR> Hunting down the invoices for the dates of purchase now xD
[00:18] <daftykins> SierraAR: i had to do that :( used to be so much simpler, now all this drive registration hassle :S
[00:18] <julian-delphiki> _Rocky_`: what is the model of the router
[00:18] <_Rocky_`> usr13: Thank you. will try nmap.

[00:19] <_Rocky_`> julian-delphiki: Cisco Linksys WAG54G2

[00:21] <lauratika> cheese, guvcview etc
[00:21] <SierraAR> In the meantime, anybody know of a good tutorial for setting up a functional dual-boot between ubuntu 12.04 and windows 7 64 bit? I cant find the tutorial I used last time
[00:22] <daftykins> _Rocky_`: guide says toggle AP isolation on then off again, or vice versa, as we recommended :>
[00:22] <escott> SierraAR, there is nothing different about win7 boot from say winXP
[00:22] <Kion1> SierraAR: Usually just insert a iso cd or usb and it will take you by the hand
[00:22] <julian-delphiki> daftykins: bingo :>
[00:22] <daftykins> julian-delphiki: i figure he missed it the last time, you know how those router web admins can be!
[00:22] <SierraAR> escott, Kion1, I do recall having to do some specific setup stuff for the boot manager to recognize both OS's
[00:23] <julian-delphiki> daftykins: for sure, overly complicated, <3 ddwrt.
[00:23] <blkadder> http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/05/17/how-to-dual-boot-ubuntu-12-04-and-windows-7/
[00:23] <_Rocky_`> daftykins: Thank you. But, I dont have an option for AP isolation at all.
[00:23] <SierraAR> Thanks blkadder

[00:23] <daftykins> _Rocky_`: there really should be, given it's a common Linksys model. :S

[00:24] <julian-delphiki> _Rocky_`: Wireless -> Advanced Wireless Settings
[00:24] <Scunizi> If you're in the know with OpenShot and I can ask a question or two of you please join me in #OpenShot_Question
[00:24] <julian-delphiki> Scunizi: thats not how this works, ask your question here
[00:24] <phunyguy> so I am back at this bug, I am trying to automount a user sshfs share, which is a specific folder on a remote SSH server, but no matter what I do, it mounts to sftp://remoteserver/home/username
[00:24] <daftykins> _Rocky_`: does the webadmin look like: http://vanilla.co.za/images/dslhelp/linksys/new/wireless_disabled.gif ?
[00:25] <_Rocky_`> julian-delphiki: Thats where I am looking. I have searched on the internet. Screenshots show AP Isolation. My router doesnt show that option.
[00:25] <daftykins> _Rocky_`: that's freaky. do you have the latest firmware on?
[00:25] <julian-delphiki> _Rocky_`: you may want to look at upgrading the firmware then
[00:25]  * daftykins high-fives julian-delphiki 
[00:25] <daftykins> julian-delphiki: i'll stop treading on your toes now :>
[00:25] <escott> phunyguy, sftp://blah blah is a url not a mountpoint
[00:26] <_Rocky_`> daftykins: Most of the UI is same. Its all blue though where its violet in the screenshot.
[00:26] <phunyguy> escott that is the end I am talking about
[00:26] <Scunizi> julian-delphiki: trying my best to keep the ubuntu channel for ubuntu.. but here goes.. Once you've cut a clip several times how do you save the individual cut segments?
[00:26] <phunyguy> it ignores what I tell the remote end to be
=== suderman_ is now known as suderman
[00:26] <escott> phunyguy, is sftp://remoteserver/home/username not the correct url? what would be the correct url?
[00:26] <SierraAR> daftykins, It says 'no limited warranty' on the drive now that it's registered
[00:26] <Soelen> hello everyone, quick question! Watching a unix/linux tutorial right now and he suggested to mount all partitions on /opt, I always thought /mnt is here for, what's the difference?
[00:26] <SierraAR> Not sure what that means
[00:26] <phunyguy> escott, even if I go to sftp://remoteserver/media/storage/users/blah it still bookmarks sftp://remoteserver/home/blah
[00:27] <phunyguy> does the same thing in Gigolo
[00:27] <phunyguy> I'd use Samba, but it is god-awful slow with gvfs
[00:27] <daftykins> SierraAR: hrmm, there's a little tooltip nearby that explains that
[00:27] <julian-delphiki> phunyguy, and what does your fstab look like
[00:27] <_Rocky_`> I think it should be the firmware guys. Thank you very much for your help. Will upgrade the firmware and come back with news. I knew I could trust the ubuntu channel ;)
[00:27] <daftykins> _Rocky_`: good luck!
[00:28] <escott> phunyguy, is /media/storage/users/blah symlinked to /home/blah on the remote
[00:28] <blkadder> Trust us at your own peril!
[00:28] <phunyguy> escott, no.
[00:28] <SierraAR> Bleh, website says I can't file an RMA for the drive because it's not under warranty
[00:28] <phunyguy> julian-delphiki, no fstab, this is gvfs
[00:28] <kvothetech> julian-delphiki: bean from enders shadow?
[00:28] <escott> Soelen, opt would be a strange place. historically there have been two places /mnt and /media. the second for removable the first for non-removable. /opt would not be a reasonable mountpoint
[00:28] <julian-delphiki> phunyguy: oh, i thought you said something about sshfs, so i wasn't sure.
[00:29] <phunyguy> julian-delphiki, I am mounting a share via SSH
[00:29] <julian-delphiki> okay, but thats not sshfs
[00:29] <phunyguy> was probably the wrong word
[00:29] <escott> !hier | Soelen
[00:29] <ubottu> Soelen: An explanation of how files and directories are organized on Ubuntu, and how they can be manipulated, can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview  see also: man hier
[00:29] <phunyguy> :)
[00:29] <escott> julian-delphiki, does sshfs use scp directives instead of the sftp module?
[00:29] <daftykins> SierraAR: doh, to amazon then i guess :S sounds like it wasn't a legit drive
[00:29] <Soelen> escott: ubottu: thanks a lot, I guess it's in the nature of solaris then
[00:30] <SierraAR> Whats odd is, looking at the invoices
[00:30] <SierraAR> We bought two drives, exactly the same, from amazon, a few days apart. One was $10 more than the other o.O
[00:30] <escott> SierraAR, even if it is outside of warranty you may still be within your local governments legally mandated period of merchantability and could charge back for a defective product
[00:30] <Soelen> ubottu: thanks for the link buddy, reading it
[00:30] <ubottu> Soelen: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[00:30] <Scunizi> In openshot, after slicing up a clip, how do you save the edited segments in their own files or put them in the project file box for later use?
[00:30] <SierraAR> escott, This one was purchased Nov 17, 2012. I have no idea what the law here in Ohio is for that
[00:31] <phunyguy> escott, what are your thoughts?
[00:31] <phunyguy> with the SCP and sftp thing
[00:31] <escott> phunyguy, they are different. i dont know what method sshfs uses
[00:31] <phunyguy> ahh, well like I said, was probably the wrong word.  I am going to sftp://url/to/share
[00:31] <daftykins> SierraAR: was it actually amazon or one of their sellers?
[00:31] <phunyguy> in Nautilus
[00:31] <SierraAR> daftykins, amazon.com
[00:31] <escott> phunyguy, yes
[00:32] <phunyguy> and then creating a bookmark from there
[00:32] <daftykins> SierraAR: ah well, just follow their returns procedure i guess. state 'bad sectors' and refuse to accept that's normal because it's never good :D
[00:32] <phunyguy> brb, trying a quick restart to finish updates
[00:34] <modifier> i have added a usb capture card....how do i know its recognized by system and drivers are installed for it ?
[00:34] <escott> SierraAR, in the future always stress test any hardware when you unbox it
[00:34] <phunyguy> back
[00:35] <escott> SierraAR, legally it probably takes you out of any possible RMA issues because you can just point to magnusun moss and ship it back to whereever you bought it from (even if that business is going OUT OF BUSINESS) and then chargeback on the CC
[00:36] <modifier> escott: have added a usb capture card....how do i know its recognized by system and drivers are installed for it ?
[00:36] <escott> SierraAR, but it also saves you from having to deal with getting your data off a failing drive and the risk of shipping confidential data back the manufacturer who might potentially sell the device as a refurb
[00:36] <SierraAR> escott, How do I stress test a drive?
[00:36] <phunyguy> yeah updates didn't cure it.
[00:36] <escott> modifier, you try and use it in an application
[00:37] <escott> !info bonnie++ | SierraAR
[00:37] <ubottu> SierraAR: bonnie++ (source: bonnie++): Hard drive benchmark suite.. In component main, is optional. Version 1.96build1 (quantal), package size 63 kB, installed size 187 kB

[00:37] <modifier> escott: suggest any application for capture card on linux....no app or driver from vendor for linux

[00:39] <modifier> escott: u look most active at this time
[00:39] <modifier> in the channel
[00:39] <julian-delphiki> still, you should address the channel, not specific unrelated people
[00:39] <modifier> anyone
[00:39] <escott> modifier, and if i knew an answer i would have messaged you. i'm not prejudiced against people with nicknames that begin with "m"
[00:39] <julian-delphiki> unfortunately you're probably not going to have much luck unless there is an open source linux driver
[00:40] <SierraAR> escott: Drive isnt in the laptop anymore, it's sitting beside me so I can read off the S/N
[00:40] <escott> SierraAR, well that drive is dead so this is more of an "in the future"
[00:40] <_Rocky_``> modifier: lol
[00:40] <modifier> well if source code is availlable then i will compile it
[00:40] <joe9> I want to run a script on startup on ubuntu 12.04. I read about rc.local. my script has the start, stop, etc, and can belong in /etc/init.d
[00:41] <joe9> Is the recommended way still to run update-rc.d?
[00:41] <escott> SierraAR, since you bought something that was OEM and has no warranty, and are two months into ownership you might have a hard time claiming merchantability
[00:41] <SierraAR> OEM?
[00:41] <phunyguy> is there another type of filesystem besides cifs and sftp that work well from linux server to linux client in a gvfs environment?
[00:41] <julian-delphiki> phunyguy: actual SSHFS?
[00:41] <escott> SierraAR, original equipment manufacturer. ie not sold with the pretty box and usually has a lesser warranty
[00:41] <phunyguy> julian-delphiki, does that work via nautilus/gigolo/gvfs?
[00:42] <phunyguy> It needs to be a per-user thing
[00:42] <phunyguy> I had a script but it got flaky when switching networks, etc.
[00:42] <julian-delphiki> wait, are you wanting to mount home dirs or something?
[00:42] <phunyguy> (vpn, non-vpn)
[00:42] <escott> julian-delphiki, is "actual sshfs" any different from sftp? what is the transport method of sshfs?
[00:43] <julian-delphiki> escott: I'm unsure, I just know its  FUSE file system
[00:43] <phunyguy> julian-delphiki, portions of /home symlinked, like ~/Music, ~/Videos - etc
[00:43] <escott> phunyguy, there is NFS
[00:43] <julian-delphiki> NFS is probably the best option
[00:43] <escott> julian-delphiki, you keep talking about sshfs as if it were NOT using sftp. I would think it probably does use sftp
[00:43] <phunyguy> hmmm....
[00:43] <julian-delphiki> escott: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHFS
[00:43] <phunyguy> let me ponder that for a bit
[00:44] <julian-delphiki> escott: actually, it looks like it uses w/e nautilus "ssh" connection uses
[00:44] <phunyguy> nautilus cannot handle nfs locations
[00:44] <escott> julian-delphiki, none of that states what protocol sshfs uses underneath. sftp is ssh
[00:44] <julian-delphiki> aware/
[00:44] <julian-delphiki> i'd say its lower level than doing it in a gui though
[00:45] <escott> julian-delphiki, phunyguy SSHFS is as I suspected sftp
[00:45] <escott> http://www.mcpressonline.com/system-administration/techtip-with-sshfs-remotely-mount-linux-file-systems-across-ssh.html
[00:45] <phunyguy> escott, yes.
[00:46] <phunyguy> escott, I had something similar, what will this get me?
[00:47] <escott> phunyguy, the whole sftp/sshfs confusion has got me confused as to what the question is.
[00:48] <phunyguy> escott, sorry, I am trying to accomplish what gigolo/nautilus/cifs give me with dynamic bookmarks, so when a connection is active, filesystems are mounted, per-user.
[00:48] <MK`> Is there a way to get Ubuntu to remember to set the sound device to my headphones when I plug them in? I need to keep doing it manually.
[00:48] <phunyguy> when using hard-mounts like in fstab, it prohibits my laptop from sleeping, and shutting down in a timely manner
[00:49] <phunyguy> MK`, version?
[00:49] <modifier> any good application for watching tv from capture card on linux....also how do i look that my capture card is recognized by system and drivers are installed for it ? how to look for any ardware connected to system is properly recognized ?

[00:50] <MAL-_> Hello, I'm having a weird issue with Ubuntu vs on Windows.. in Ubuntu 12.10 with unity if I right click the desktop then right click another location it simply closes the 1st context menu instead of opening the context menu in the second location.. has anyone noticed this too? It's like first right click open context, 2nd right click close context, 3rd open context. Ideally when I right click I'd like to get the context menu each time.
[00:50] <phunyguy> escott, also, the reason I wanted to avoid CIFS, is due to speed.  gvfs/cifs performance is horrid on wifi, and vpn
[00:50] <phunyguy> I can get 8-9MB/s with hard mounted samba shares, but 1.0MB/s with gvfs
[00:50] <modifier> julian-delphiki: also when connecting through usb...the front lid is getting on
[00:50] <phunyguy> escott it doesn't perform well at all.
[00:51] <julian-delphiki> modifier: it looks like many people have not really hard luck with that card
[00:51] <escott> phunyguy, im not sure there is a good solution with all the requirements you have stated
[00:52] <phunyguy> awww...
[00:52] <modifier> julian-delphiki: ohh,....can u find source code for driver ? i will try to compile and see if it works
[00:52] <julian-delphiki> modifier: http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Trident_TM6000 is really the only information i can find
[00:52] <phunyguy> well, thanks anyway for your help.  I am hoping performance for cifs gets better, but I don't have my hopes up.  Been trying for years.

[00:52] <Robsome> Hi all.
[00:53] <modifier> julian-delphiki: late warnings....now i am stuck with it :(
[00:53] <Robsome> Installing 12.10 as I type
[00:53] <Robsome> Only 2.5 hours remain:P
[00:54] <phunyguy> I have eaten my words, escott.  The updates must have triggered a speed increase with cifs.  Although it isn't 8-9MB/s, it is around 4-5MB/s
[00:54] <phunyguy> I guess it's tolerable.
[00:54] <phunyguy> thanks for your help, escott.
[00:55] <daftykins> MAL-_: that sounds tolerable enough to consider posting somewhere as a recommendation, doubt it's going to have people up in arms
[00:55] <AceFace> hello, all!
[00:56] <AceFace> is there anyone here with experience using KVM?
[00:56] <daftykins> AceFace: just ask away
[00:56] <MAL-_> daftykins, It's an annoyance but it's causing problems when working the channels in Mumble. I'm just wondering if there's any mouse tweak programs I can try or if mouse settings are as is in Ubuntu.
[00:56] <compdoc> AceFace, yeah
[00:56] <AceFace> compdoc: here is my issue: i.imgur.com/2g5bA.png
[00:56] <AceFace> http://i.imgur.com/2g5bA.png
[00:57] <gyre008> why does apt-get upgrade <package_name> upgades kernel I will never get...arrrgh
[00:57] <jrib> gyre008: it doesn't...
[00:57] <compdoc> what are you doing to get that error?
[00:57] <AceFace> i have ran "kvm-ok" and it says i can virtualiz hardware
[00:57] <bootkigftrgds> I got Empathy to load up on my Lubuntu netbook, but when I ask it to load 'an account' it just goes to system setting .. what am I doing wrong ?
[00:57] <AceFace> i am setting up a VM using virt-manager
[00:58] <AceFace> the gui tool
[00:58] <gyre008> well i just ran apt-get upgrade chef and the kernel has been upgraded too...wth
[00:58] <compdoc> does virt manager open?
[00:58] <escott> AceFace, and this message is coming from the guest
[00:58] <jrib> gyre008: that's doubtful
[00:58] <jrib> gyre008: are you sure  you didn't run "apt-get dist-upgrade"?
[00:58] <AceFace> yes, infact i can open it and configure the guest VM, but at the last step it gives the error
[00:59] <AceFace> here is my lshw: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1532944/
[00:59] <trolol> hello, can someone help me on fully purging fglrx?
[00:59] <gyre008> jrib: 100% positive
[00:59] <escott> AceFace, sounds like the client needs to load a kernel module?
[00:59] <AceFace> my CPU can virtualize hardware and its enabled in the bios
[00:59] <jrib> gyre008: what makes you say your kernel was upgraded?
[00:59] <gyre008> the output in the log ?
[00:59] <compdoc> AceFace, which mainboard?

[01:00] <trolol> has anyone purged fglrx before?
[01:00] <compdoc> AceFace, did you add yourself to the libvirtd group? Does kvm have permissions to write to the storage?
[01:01] <fishcooker> is there any boot grub editor on ubuntu?
[01:01] <AceFace> yes, i have added myself to the group with sudo adduser <username> libvirtd
[01:01] <AceFace> and i got a success message
[01:01] <compdoc> AceFace, you know about logging out after?

[01:05] <MAL-_> modifier, Virtualbox is definitely awesome
[01:05] <AceFace> daftykins: i will try that
[01:05] <modifier> and installing win7 in virtual machine in ubuntu will be good or installing it side by side ubuntu as a complete independent OS ?

[01:11] <AceFace> compdoc: shall i change it back?
[01:11] <BillyZane|2> sure wish i had some sound
[01:11] <compdoc> AceFace, how did you install kvm?
[01:11] <trolol> <daftykins>: thats what I originally did, but it seems that it doesn't work
[01:11] <MAL-_> modifier, I've never tried Windows 7 in Virtualbox but I'm about to try ReactOS to see how well that might work for running windows stuff.
[01:11] <compdoc> AceFace, no - enabled is right
[01:11] <escott> AceFace, lsmod | grep kvm does that show kvm.ko as loaded
[01:11] <AceFace> compdoc: i installed per instructions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation

[01:11] <modifier> how to look for all the drivers loaded in system ?

[01:18] <AceFace> compdoc: sorry, i was afk for a min
[01:18] <daftykins> trolol: that's odd. not sure a manual install is the best idea anyway. here's a crazy idea though - why not *install* fglrx so you definitely can remove it? :D

[01:22] <AceFace> i may have found a bug?

[01:23] <hays> are there any new ultrabooks with flawless or near-flawless linux support?

[01:27] <vuln> How can I make it appear once and for all?

[01:27] <dr_willis> vuln:  whats your video chipset?
=== julian-delphiki is now known as bean
[01:32] <savagecroc> hmm right.. why on a default install of ubuntu do other users have permission to ls -al my home directory and  access half the files?
[01:32] <savagecroc> what should the permissions be?
[01:33] <savagecroc> i'm guessing user::rwx  group::r-x other:--- on the directory
[01:33] <hays> this is what i have: drwxr-xr-x
[01:33] <savagecroc> yeah but why should other get access
[01:33] <savagecroc> seems nuts
[01:34] <hays> well they don't have write access
[01:34] <Hilikus> is nvidia still the clear choice for ubuntu?
[01:34] <savagecroc> hays: yeah but they can still ls around

[01:36] <Orkultus> gyre2008 if it finds a newer version it upgrades it

[01:51] <Orkultus> modifier then it's as simple as sudo apt-get install cinnamon
[01:51] <modifier> ok
[01:51] <dr_willis> and hope cinnamon dosent break the rest of the system.. ;)

[01:57] <histo> tweikable: have you tried just using the tor browsers availible?
[01:57] <Orkultus> for a suggestion to anyone looking for a new laptop. If you get an ACER V3-771G ..haha your gonna have a hell of a time getting linux to run
[01:57] <histo> tweikable: much easier to set up and it's portable
[01:58] <tweikable> i think so ,  not sure is does it have the features that vidilia has with being able to click for new identity
[01:58] <djzn> unity needs to show the applications menu at all times.... always, like MAC
[01:58] <histo> tweikable: yes it does
[01:58] <tweikable> problem im haviang. when i type tor in terminal says its running. i go to ip chicken. still says my ip address
[01:58] <Super_Dog> Upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 went pretty well but I can't seem to load Acrobat Reader 9.X that was on my old 10.04 setup.
[01:58] <tweikable> with the light sppeed bs
[01:58] <dr_willis> Theres indicator applets to show a more old type menu... trivial to install.
[01:58] <histo> tweikable: you can choose a new identity in the side panel that's open
[01:59] <Super_Dog> I get this: "acroread : Depends: ia32-libs (>= 20080808) but it is not going to be installedE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages."
[01:59] <histo> tweikable: can't remember if it's vidalia or what it's called
=== aliceinch4ins is now known as s4ltednet
[01:59] <tweikable> ok./ i will re download it. i have fast internet, do you have the time to help me out
[01:59] <Super_Dog> I see this:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acroread/+bug/990761
[01:59] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 990761 in acroread (Ubuntu) "acroread 9.5.1 is not installable on Ubuntu Precise amd64 system" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[01:59] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: do you really need acrobat? Linux has plenty of other PDF reader programs
[01:59] <tweikable> should i download vidila, or the tor browser package
[01:59] <Adiost> Hey guys
[01:59] <tweikable> hi.
[01:59] <djono> how do u get flash to work?
[02:00] <histo> tweikable: tor browser
[02:00] <tweikable> ok. once sec tyhank you so much for this help
[02:00] <tweikable> 1 sec
[02:00] <Super_Dog> Actually I do.  Only one that will open password secured encrypted files my co-workers send me.
[02:00] <modifier> i like foxit phantom....anyone suggest its equivalent for linux
[02:00] <Orkultus> djono: sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer
[02:00] <Adiost> Some time ago I've heard that recompiling kernel on the machine to use on could significantly improve perfomance
[02:00] <Adiost> is that true?
[02:00] <tweikable> ok i clicked
[02:00] <djono> thx
[02:01] <tweikable> im using archive manager right
[02:01] <modifier> Orkultus: djono install adobe-flashplugin
[02:01] <tweikable> or do i just save it
[02:01] <dr_willis> Adiost:  if you knew enough to compile it.. and knew enough to know what to optmize.. perhaps..
[02:01] <dr_willis> Adiost:  hard to justify the work needed.
[02:01] <Super_Dog> Looks like this is a known problem.
[02:01] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: what does sudo apt-get -f install do?
[02:01] <Super_Dog> Nothing...
[02:01] <tweikable> Should i be using archive manager to open the file. or just save it. when clicking tor browswer bundle
[02:02] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: it looks like it's needing 32 bit libs...is there a 64bit version?
[02:02] <android> The best alternative for CCleaner in Linux is BleachBit sudo apt-get install bleachbit
[02:02] <yugnip> i am trying to compile an app that needs openGL, which i thought i had, but the app doesn't http://pastebin.com/L4uJQvd2
[02:03] <Adiost> Orkultus: -f for "forced"
[02:03] <Super_Dog> Here's the output from command "sudo apt-get -f install" -  http://pastebin.com/BMiRHkWG
[02:04] <tweikable> ok i just downlaoded it now what should i do
[02:04] <tweikable> sudo apt-get install telepathy-sofiasip telepathy-butterfly telepathy-idle libtelepathy-farsight0 python-tpfarsight
[02:04] <tweikable> ups wronge post
[02:04] <yugnip> Super_Dog, you have something else open that is a package manager
[02:05] <yugnip> Super_Dog, close synaptic or software center or update manager first
[02:05] <Super_Dog> Nope.  Software Sources, Synaptic, and Update Manager are closed.  Just have terminal window open.
[02:05] <tweikable> after downloading tor browser bundle. were should i extract it to
[02:05] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: i would check your processes with the top command
[02:06] <bean> Orkultus: ps aux
[02:06] <bean> works better
[02:06] <yugnip> Super_Dog, update manager is probably working in the background, give it a minute and run the command again
[02:07] <Super_Dog> Update manager is not running.  Not in tab list or in programs on "top" command.
[02:07] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: i sent you a link
[02:08] <Super_Dog> Tried this.  No dice:  http://askubuntu.com/questions/166566/cannot-install-adobe-reader
[02:08] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: im trying the link i sent you
[02:10] <Super_Dog> Is there not a 64-bit *.deb version of Adobe Reader?
[02:10] <Super_Dog> Hmmm...
[02:10] <Orkultus> got it working fine
[02:11] <Super_Dog> Orkultus: Did you use that i386 version in the link on the page you gave me?
[02:11] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: yeah and i installed libxml2:i386
[02:12] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: opens up just fine
[02:12] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: thing about adobe...they suck when it comes to linux support. They always drop support on everything
[02:12] <Super_Dog> Let me check...
[02:13] <Super_Dog> Is there no 64 bit *.deb file for Adobe Reader?
[02:13] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: no sorry
[02:13] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: like i said, adobe dont give a crap about linux. im suprised we had a 32bit version
[02:13] <Super_Dog> But the 32-bit works on our 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS....?
[02:13] <vuln> dr_willis: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF108 [GeForce GT 540M] (rev a1) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
[02:14] <Super_Dog> ...still installing over here.
[02:14] <vuln> I'm sorry for taking so long to reply you dr_willis :)
[02:14] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: that 32bit version works on my 64bit Linux Mint 14 no problem
[02:14] <whatasunnyday> Hi! I rebooted my entire computer and it isn't in a language I recognize. It looks like its asian based.
[02:14] <whatasunnyday> I'm using cinannamon and I have no idea how I did this or to convert it back.
[02:14] <_DADDY> Orkultus, speaking of mint did you have any wifi connection issues?
[02:14] <whatasunnyday> Some programs are in in this asian text like xchat but I remember what buttons to press so it isn't so bad.
[02:15] <challengerX> whatasunnyday: no racist comments
[02:15] <Orkultus> _DADDY: sometimes the connection would drop..was an easy fix...had to go into the connection settings and disable ipv6
[02:15] <Super_Dog> ...atom processor ain't the quickest running 64-bit I guess...
[02:16] <dr_willis> whatasunnyday:  cinammon isent really supported here so we cant help much
[02:16] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: lol nope...good for a netbook though
[02:16] <_DADDY> Orkultus, yep thats the one i couldnt get it to stop
[02:16] <Super_Dog> will report Orkultus.... be patient please...
[02:16] <whatasunnyday> challengerX: what did I say that it was racist?
[02:17] <Orkultus> whatasunnyday: i will send you a link with the fix to your exact problem
[02:17] <whatasunnyday> thanks orkultus.
[02:17] <Orkultus> np
[02:17] <whatasunnyday> i think i sent it in ubuntu
[02:18] <whatasunnyday> because in the system settings there is only one icon that is in this non english text
[02:18] <whatasunnyday> and its a flag with a un symbol
[02:18] <whatasunnyday> it has a list of possible languages to convert to but i can't read any of them
[02:18] <Orkultus> whatasunnyday: ah
[02:18] <Orkultus> whatasunnyday: try that webpage
[02:20] <whatasunnyday> no dice orkultus
[02:20] <djzn> whatasunnyday, another racist comment ?
[02:20] <challengerX>  /join #vbox
[02:20] <challengerX> :P
[02:20] <whatasunnyday> dzjn, i'm sorry
[02:20] <djzn> whatasunnyday, just kidding... he was harsh on you..
[02:20] <whatasunnyday> i'm not sure what i'm saying thats racist and i don't mean to sound ignorant
[02:20] <whatasunnyday> oh
[02:20] <whatasunnyday> :(
[02:20] <challengerX> pheww !
[02:20] <Orkultus> lol
[02:20] <djzn> i am a convict racist! but I can't tell anything here.
[02:21] <Orkultus> everyone is racist..it's ok
=== lubuntu is now known as Guest98604
[02:22] <Super_Dog> Seemed to install Acrobat but does not launch.  Unless it takes like 5 minutes to launch...  There is now an AcroReader icon in Unity.
[02:22] <jirido> rasist is a bit stupid, its mor natural to be a culurist
[02:22] <dr_willis> you could run it from terminal and look for errors.
[02:22] <amagee> hey, i have a vps running ubuntu 12.04 that has just decided that it won't let me run `top` without sudo; it says "Cannot find /proc/version - is /proc mounted?"  .. any ideas?
[02:23] <jrib> amagee: ls -l /proc/version
[02:23] <^Rubiu5^> hi
[02:23] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: lol it took my quad core a few seconds to load it...it comes with up their license terms page first
[02:23] <Super_Dog> Here's what I get when I run "acroread" from terminal:  http://pastebin.com/L8V0BBhT
[02:24] <amagee> jrib: -r--r----- 1 root root 0 Jan 15 13:23 /proc/version  .  I tried giving it other-read, but that just made the problem more bizarre.  There is no error message, but the entire terminal session breaks.
[02:24] <^Rubiu5^> windows 8 is the best OS ever ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ :D
[02:24] <Orkultus> sudo apt-get install libstdc++6
[02:24] <whatasunnyday> can anyone read chinese?
[02:24] <Super_Dog> "libstdc++.so.6" ???
[02:24] <Super_Dog> Will try it.
[02:25] <^Rubiu5^> chineses sucks
[02:25] <somsip> whatasunnyday: google translate
[02:25] <Orkultus> i took windows 8 off this windows 8 only laptop and put linux on it
[02:25] <whatasunnyday> i can't select the text to highlight to copy and paste
[02:25] <lewisou> ^Rubiu5^: want do you mean by that?
[02:25] <blkadder> amagee: That looks pretty broken.
[02:25] <Super_Dog> "libstdc++6 is already the newest version."
[02:25] <jrib> ^Rubiu5^: this channel is for ubuntu support.  Please stop with the offtopic chatter here
[02:25] <^Rubiu5^> .oO lewisou Oo. i mean what i mean
[02:25] <^Rubiu5^> .oO jrib Oo. ok
[02:26] <challengerX> ^Rubiu5^: Did you come here for bill gates charity program?
[02:26] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: i could be looking for the 32bit..which im sure it is
[02:26] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: sudo apt-get install libstdc++6:i386
[02:26] <whatasunnyday> orkultus, i looked at the second answer and it helped :)
[02:26] <^Rubiu5^> .oO challengerX Oo. of course
[02:26] <Orkultus> whatasunnyday: good good
[02:26] <whatasunnyday> sorry the second link
[02:26] <whatasunnyday> well not the second link but the second answer
[02:27] <^Rubiu5^> ok ok
[02:27] <whatasunnyday> i'm out guys
[02:27] <Guest98604> Hi. First off well done to anyone involved in the Lubuntu project (It runs so much faster than windows on a Celeron 2.4Ghz)    Q: When loading Qjack (Lubuntu) there is no sound and system has to be re-booted to get sound back....Any hints?
[02:27] <whatasunnyday> thanks for yoru help
[02:27] <Orkultus> later
[02:27] <^Rubiu5^> understood
[02:27] <Orkultus> np
[02:27] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: i love chasing dependencies...lol
[02:28] <jrib> amagee: guess you need to figure out why the permissions are like that, for starters
[02:28] <Super_Dog> Thanks Orkultus....at least something installed with that command.  You are very clever...
[02:28] <challengerX> ^Rubiu5^: Good!
[02:28] <K350> What doesn't run faster then windows on any system?
[02:28] <Orkultus> so what's going on with the losing 32bit support in kernel 3.8?
[02:28] <modifier> how to create debs with compiled apps ?
[02:28] <Guest98604> :)
[02:28] <amagee> jrib: yeah, i have no idea.. it was working last time i logged onto the system. i think i'll just file a ticket with the vps provider.
[02:28] <somsip> Orkultus: i386 support, not 32bit
[02:28] <jrib> amagee: probably best
[02:28] <Super_Dog> Bingo..... Orkultus is the king.  Thank you very much sir.  Another pleasant solution on the #ubuntu IRC channel.
[02:28] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: got it working eh? awesome!
[02:29] <challengerX> K350:  BSOD
[02:29] <Super_Dog> Yep.... thanks for that one.  I'm OK at Ubuntu troubleshooting but definitely not in your league...
[02:29] <vuln> Anyone who has successfuly managed to use Unity+Compiz in Ubuntu 12.04?
[02:29] <modifier> Orkultus: get TM5600 chipset capture card working !
[02:29] <Orkultus> so what does this mean for supplying i386 libs for programs in a 64 environment?
[02:29] <malkauns> vuln, yes
[02:29] <K350> challengerX: lol
[02:29] <malkauns> vuln, unity uses compiz LOL
[02:29] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: Glad to help :)
[02:31] <lanken> ok, WTF unity, I'm trying to add Sublime Text to the launcher, and it's impossible
[02:31] <whatasunnyday> alright, so i still have the problem
[02:31] <Super_Dog> Boy Adobe's really gone to crap on Linux...  Version 9.5.1?  I'm using 11 on my Windows Laptop...
[02:31] <lanken> I've tried dragging in the executable, tried dragging in a "Launcher / shortcut thing" of the executable
[02:31] <somsip> Orkultus: mayeb this will help http://askubuntu.com/questions/229814/does-the-removal-of-i386-from-the-kernel-mean-ubuntu-is-dropping-32-bit-support
[02:31] <malkauns> lanken, u need to create a .desktop file, most of which are located in /usr/share/applications
[02:31] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: like i said..adobe doesn't care about linux..lol
[02:32] <whatasunnyday> what i noticed: in /etc/default/locate the first two lines: LANG and LANGUAGE were to zn:utf-8 and i set them back to english
[02:32] <Super_Dog> Wow, I can tell.  This interface is harsh....
[02:32] <whatasunnyday> where else is it set other than /etc/default/locale?
[02:32] <lanken> malkauns: how is this different from the "links" that I can create with the file browser?
[02:32] <lanken> malkauns: are those symlinks?
[02:33] <malkauns> lanken, .desktop files in that dir show up in the unity launcher if the icon is set correctly
[02:33] <vuln> malkauns: when I press SUPER, the left app bar of Unity is not showing up :( (it's not viewable, but it's there). Do you know how can I work this around?
[02:33] <malkauns> lanken, no
[02:33] <funky> Anyone know how to access unity's Suspend option on Gnome 3?
[02:33] <Orkultus> somsip: oh i see..thanks
[02:33] <malkauns> vuln, tried unity --replace & ?
[02:34] <zack> hi
[02:34] <zack> can someone help me out, im an ubuntu newbie
[02:34] <challengerX> z
[02:34] <zack> so I just installed ubuntu 12.10. I went to system settings and for graphics, it says "Unknown". there are no propietary driers installed.
[02:35] <zack> how do I get propietary drivers? am I basically screwed
[02:35] <zack> its so laggy
[02:35] <zack> Radeon x600
[02:35] <malkauns> lanken, links tell the filesystem where a file is, .desktop files contain metadata about an application including the path to the binary
[02:35] <lanken> malkauns: this is incredibly frustrating for such a basic use case.
[02:35] <malkauns> lanken, agree :P
[02:35] <vuln> Just did malkauns. It didnt work
[02:35] <vuln> :(
[02:35] <malkauns> but its up to the app developer to provide the .desktop file in the install package
[02:35] <lanken> malkauns: there's a youtube video instructing me to basically clone one of the .desktop files and change its properties to point to the thing I want to target
[02:36] <JonathanLima> i was updating from 12.04 to 12.10 and my system suspended... i made a loop on bash to run apt-get upgrade, dist-upgrade and -f install... but i got stuck on a dependency problem that seems to have something to do with mesa... could someone give me a hand?
[02:36] <malkauns> lanken, yea that's what i usually do
[02:36] <zack> can someone please help me find a driver for ubuntu 12.10 64-bit, graphics card Radeon X600
[02:36] <zack> please!
[02:36] <KI4RO> Why doesn't gtkpod show up as an option on the programs list for when I insert a music player? (IPOD)
[02:36] <zack> display driver
[02:36] <malkauns> vuln, how do u know the unity launcher is really there but u cant see it?
[02:36] <lanken> malkauns: that's bullshit, it's up to the desktop environment to provide convenient ways of launching your programs. please.
[02:36] <vuln> malkauns: cause pressint TAB and ENTER I can run the apps that were there :D
[02:37] <zack> someone please
[02:37] <vuln> I mean SUPER and then TAB, TAB, TAB and ENTER and it will run the app that was third on the list
[02:37] <vuln> ^_^
[02:37] <malkauns> lanken, the desktop environment cannot just "guess" where an app is that u install unless the installer tells it
[02:37] <Orkultus> KI4R0: it never did that for me as well
[02:37] <zack> I cant find display drivers and its so laggy . x600 radeon
[02:37] <Orkultus> KI4R0: of course i just used rhythmbox or Banshee to deal with my ipod
[02:37] <KI4RO> Orkultus, Thanks...very strange...do you use gtkpod?
[02:38] <Guest98604> Q: Audio works on Ubuntu Studio (But graphics lacking) so changed to Lubuntu (Graphics acceptable) but sound cuts when loading Qjack and have to reboot?....Any hints??
[02:39] <malkauns> vuln, strange, u have your display drivers set up properly?
[02:39] <lanken> malkauns: Nautilus probably needs to do the work. If you've got an executable binary in a folder, you should be able to drag it to the unity bar (ideally), or at the very least have a quick action to "add this to System Applications"
[02:39] <vuln> malkauns: I think so
[02:39] <malkauns> lanken, true
[02:39] <vuln> '^_^
[02:39] <lanken> this is a real let-down. I'll install kde3.5 if anything else like this happens to me.
[02:39] <KI4RO> Orkultus, Wife got me the shuffle as a Christmas present.  I've been using Rhythmbox as well but would like to use gtkpod since it is supposedly written for the device
[02:40] <malkauns> lanken, LOL
[02:40] <vuln> malkauns: I think it may be a conflict with some Compiz things I have set up.
[02:40] <lanken> it's also infuriating that you can't manually text-edit the path of the nautilus breadcrumbs.
[02:40] <malkauns> vuln, does it work fine with unity 2d?
[02:40] <malkauns> lanken, omg hell will break loose if u do that LOL
[02:41] <Guest98604> Is it even worth trying programs like Qjack in Lubuntu?
[02:41] <Orkultus> KI4R0: i found gtkpod to be very confusing. It was the first ipod supported program for Linux, but then later on other musics adapted the plugin
[02:41] <malkauns> vuln, maybe try unity --reset (baring in mind it will reset anything u did in ccsm)
[02:41] <vuln> malkauns: unity 2d?
[02:41] <vuln> malkauns: it all worked just fine before I started messing with ccsm :P
[02:41] <malkauns> vuln, unity --reset will restore things to default
[02:41] <Orkultus> KI4R0: Music Players* is what i ment
[02:41] <vuln> malkauns: aw :(
[02:42] <vuln> I will give it a shot
[02:42] <malkauns> vuln, well at least then u can track down what it is in ccsm that messed it up
[02:42] <KI4RO> Orkultus, That was my experience with Gtkpod as well...thought it was just me...glad I'm not the only one! LOL
[02:42] <vuln> malkauns: indeed.
[02:42] <vuln> I set up my Ubuntu in Italian in order to not forget my italian
[02:42] <malkauns> heh
[02:42] <vuln> but I'm not used to Ubuntu terms in Italian so I'm a bit confused
[02:42] <vuln> haha
[02:43] <lanken> malkauns: kubuntu was always a piece of crap, but kde3.5 is golden. it's still maintained.
[02:43] <Orkultus> KI4R0: yeah i really would prefer to use either Rhythmbox, or Banshee..there is also Amarok, if your in a KDE environment
[02:43] <KI4RO> Orkultus, Maybe they'll come with a new more friendly version one of these days! LOL
[02:43] <Orkultus> KI4R0: lol we all hope
[02:43] <kdns> Hi all :) My logs are full of entries about nullmailer: nullmailer[1886]	Starting delivery: protocol: smtp host: mail. file: 1356296386.11263
[02:43] <vuln> O____O
[02:43] <vuln> Now it disappeared!
[02:43] <malkauns> lanken, mmm no global menu but maybe u dont mind
[02:43] <KI4RO> Orkultus, Tried Amarok...it, also, was confusing to me
[02:43] <Guest98604> Sorry....Just realized there is a channel for Lubuntu :)
[02:43] <kdns> Please tell me what it creating and what is attempting to send these messages, I'd like to turn both OFF
[02:43] <vuln> When I press super malkauns, the whole window appear BUT the left bar
[02:44] <vuln> what might have happened?
[02:44] <KI4RO> Orkultus, Didn't care for it taking up residence in my system either
[02:44] <Orkultus> KI4R0: give Banshee a try
[02:44] <malkauns> vuln, hmm now try unity --replace
[02:44] <vuln> k
[02:45] <rkdewa> morning brothers
[02:45] <rkdewa> haay
[02:46] <rkdewa> hallo
[02:46] <KI4RO> Orkultus, Thanks for the suggestion and for chatting with me regarding the Ipod...always nice to find another person

[02:46] <Orkultus> Ki4R0: always glad to help
[02:46] <KI4RO> Orkultus, One more question...have you had any luck getting the Ipod to announce what its playing?
[02:46] <vuln> malkauns: didnt work :o
[02:47] <vuln> the bar is still issing
[02:47] <skp1> SonikkuAmerica: yo
[02:47] <malkauns> vuln, hmm
[02:48] <Super_Dog> Man - now I have a "cannot install ia32-libs" error in Software center trying to install TeamViewer...
[02:48] <malkauns> vuln, maybe u have to remove your .config/compiz-1 then
[02:48] <malkauns> vuln, in your home dir
[02:48] <Super_Dog> These 32-bit libraries are really roughing me up...
[02:48] <vuln> the entire dir malkauns ?
[02:49] <malkauns> vuln, yea or maybe just move it to compiz-1_bak or something
[02:49] <malkauns> just incase
[02:49] <vuln> k
[02:49] <vuln> then unity --replace again?
[02:49] <malkauns> reset, then replace
[02:50] <vuln> unity --reset ?
[02:50] <malkauns> might just be better to log out and back in again after reset
[02:50] <malkauns> yea
[02:50] <Orkultus> KI4R0: this when you are playing the ipod while it's attatched to the computer?
[02:50] <vuln> the nunity --replace? can I do it from a terminal like ctrl+alt+F1 or I must do it in the current display?
[02:50] <malkauns> current display..
[02:50] <vuln> ty
[02:50] <KI4RO> Orkultus, No supposed to be able to do it when you are playing it while walking...it is a shuffle
[02:51] <malkauns> if u do it from ctr+alt+F1 then u must do export DISPLAY=:0 before
[02:51] <dr_willis> unity --replace wouldent work from teh consoles.
[02:51] <malkauns> dr_willis, it will if u set the DISPLAY environment variable
[02:51] <Orkultus> KI4R0: oh so it says it like with voice in your headphones?
[02:51] <dr_willis> then it woul dbe the same as running it on the running desktop. ;)
[02:52] <malkauns> yep
[02:52] <KI4RO> Orkultus, yes, it is supposed to be able to do that
[02:52] <dr_willis> Unity and compiz can get so confused - its often better to log out/back in
[02:52] <malkauns> yea
[02:52] <Orkultus> KI4R0: never had the chance to see one of those ipods. I have a classic 80gb. That's the last time i have touched an ipod
[02:53] <malkauns> but unity --replace restarts compiz anyway
[02:53] <Guest98604> Why is there nobody in Lubuntu room :(
[02:53] <KI4RO> Orkultus, Okay, thanks again.  Have a nice...whatever it is in your part of the world
[02:53] <dr_willis> They change this stuff with every reelase i cant rember
[02:53] <dr_willis> Guest98604:  because they are all in here perhaps.
[02:54] <malkauns> if compiz/unity crash or mess up often like it does for me, then login out and back in every time isnt an option
[02:54] <dr_willis> I rarely have  issues in 12.10 these days..
[02:54] <Orkultus> KI4R0: washington state...cold and rainy...you have a good one as well
[02:54] <Guest98604> I'm not sure if that answers the question but thanks.
[02:54] <vuln> it's really messed up now :(
[02:54] <malkauns> i'm on 12.04 and will wait for 13.04
[02:54] <vuln> left bar doesnt appear and when I maximize a window there is an empty space at the top
[02:54] <vuln> between the window and the top bar
[02:54] <vuln> :(
[02:54] <vuln> malkauns:
[02:55] <malkauns> 12.10 had too many issues for me when it was first out
[02:55] <malkauns> vuln, ?
[02:55] <dr_willis> vuln:  does the guest user work properly?
[02:55] <vuln> :(
[02:55] <vuln> I will have to log out to test it out, right?
[02:55] <malkauns> vuln, probably the best thing to do
[02:56] <dr_willis> also you could test with a newly made user. - if the new user and guest have the same issue -> points to a system issue.. if they WORK -> points to a Setting file for the problem user
[02:56] <malkauns> brb
[02:56] <vuln> YES
[02:56] <vuln> It works perfectly (the guest session)
[02:56] <malkauns> nice
[02:56] <malkauns> vuln, now you're getting somewhere
[02:57] <vuln> It sounds like so
[02:57] <vuln> So what should I do?
[02:57] <dr_willis> now i would make a test user. and verify it works for them
[02:57] <dr_willis> 'sudo adduser testuser'
[02:58] <Guest98604> It's my name isn't it?....It says ignore me I haven't even bothered to come up with an inventive name.
[02:59] <vuln> Yes, it does dr_willis
[02:59] <vuln> created and logged in and the lfet bar is perfect
[02:59] <vuln> left*
[02:59] <alexandros_c> how to enble hibernate on xubuntu 12.10?
[03:00] <Guest98604> Guest98604 has quit  :)
[03:00] <bsmith093> firefox is dead, but my swap is still full how do i fix that without rebooting
[03:01] <Orkultus> alexandros_c: is it located in the xfce-settings menu under power?
[03:01] <K350> c
[03:01] <K350> c
[03:01] <vuln> dr_willis, malkauns what should I do then?
[03:01] <alexandros_c> it is greyed out and my computer supports hibernate
[03:01] <vuln> It sounds reasonable that it should work after removing compiz-1
[03:02] <malkauns> vuln, back up and remove your user dir and user then readd it
[03:02] <Orkultus> bsmith093: you want to clear you swap memory?
[03:02] <malkauns> vuln, maybe its your ~/.gnome2 too
[03:02] <dr_willis> id nuke every setting in your home; _
[03:03] <dr_willis> Nuke it from orbit.. only way to be sure. ;)
[03:03] <OnlyHalfTheTime> Alexandro, it was removed as an option. I forget whether or not you can reenable it.
[03:03] <bsmith093> Orkultus: yes, and the ram too
[03:03] <dr_willis> Or MOve all the setting files/dirs to a backup dir.
[03:03] <malkauns> vuln, try removing ~/.gnome2 as a quick test, if that doesn't work then do what i said above
[03:03] <Orkultus> bsmith093: have you tried the swapoff and swapon commands?
[03:03] <malkauns> vuln, log out and back in ofcourse to make sure your test is good
[03:03] <bsmith093> whats that
[03:03] <dr_willis>  dozens of setting files in .config and .gnome* and .gconf*  i recall
[03:03] <alexandros_c> Orkultus, it is not available there, but my computer supports hibernate. tried the enable  fix but it did not work
[03:04] <dr_willis> I can nuke my settings and back to my normal setup in about a min. ;)
[03:05] <Orkultus> bsmith093: such like sudo swapoff -a sudo swapon -a
[03:05] <dr_willis> also double check the .Xauthority file. it shouldent be owned by root.  you could just move/rename it also
=== Onixs_ is now known as Onixs
[03:05] <vuln> .Xauthority is owned by my user

[03:07] <SuperFunkyFly> How can I reboot my networking.
[03:07] <alexandros_c> Orkultus, hibernate is not an option

=== snowrichard_ is now known as snowrichard
[03:08] <Orkultus> alexandros_c: i believe it would be called suspend
[03:08] <SuperFunkyFly> Is /etc/init.d/networking restart the only way?
[03:08] <kdns> bsmith093:  look at a task manager and sort by memory usage to find the hungry app
[03:08] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: i would go with something stable like 7
[03:09] <bsmith093> kdns: i am and the greediest is only using 600mb of ram
[03:09] <kdns> SuperFunkyFly: No, but it works, doesn't it?
[03:09] <alexandros_c> no that is different, suspend is to RAM and hibernate is to disk
[03:09] <Orkultus> Super_Dog: Never know if a Beta is gonna fail you
[03:09] <snowrichard> hhh
[03:09] <PatrickDickey> SuperFunkyFly: sudo service networking restart might work
[03:09] <escott> bsmith093, "top -m" if you only have a command line
[03:09] <SuperFunkyFly> PatrickDickey that was much quicker and to the point. Thx
[03:09] <OnlyHalfTheTime> Bsmith, try running htop from bash. It gives you a lot of good info about what's doing what
[03:09] <Super_Dog> SuperFunkyFly:  If it's Samba you're dealing with you may wish to try:  "sudo service smbd restart"
[03:09] <kdns> bsmith093: how much ram and swap do you have?
[03:09] <PatrickDickey> SuperFunkyFly: They both do the same thing, and in some cases, you have to do the long route.
[03:10] <SuperFunkyFly> Never used Samba?

[03:10] <OnlyHalfTheTime> Ctrl-c
[03:10] <alexandros_c> Orkultus, I know what you are toalking about my laptop suspports suspend and hibernate
[03:10] <kdns> SuperFunkyFly: it was to the point because he made the assumption that you don't know that you need to be root to restart networking. Sorry I wanted to work up to it without making assumptions.
[03:11] <BONG_IT> how to change nick
[03:11] <PatrickDickey> PDun, I use ps | grep process and then kill processID.
[03:11] <SuperFunkyFly> PatrickDickey kind of old school. Was working this this stuff back in 95 and now I am back with it in at work. Wow a lot has changed in the *nix world
[03:11] <BONG_IT> this is smb
[03:11] <Orkultus> alexandros_c: this is what i could find http://xflinux.blogspot.com/2011/01/enable-hibernate-and-suspend-in-xubuntu.html
[03:11] <kdns> bsmith093: that's not a lot, if your #1 app is using 600 of it, then #2 through #10 are probably enough to fill it.

[03:12] <escott> !samba | BONG_IT
[03:12] <ubottu> BONG_IT: Samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT.
[03:12] <Orkultus> alexandros_c: or try this http://askubuntu.com/questions/94754/how-to-enable-hibernation
[03:12] <SuperFunkyFly> kdns no sry about that. I just really did not know what Samba was. Been working with BSD for the last ... 10 years or so @.@
[03:12] <bsmith093> kdns:  but i have these apps open all the time and they never use this much, im gonna reboot
[03:12] <kdns> what's wrong with BONG_IT s nick?
[03:12] <OnlyHalfTheTime> Bsmith093 noooooooooo!
[03:13] <orbitwhite> hey guys i have abnormal amount of unused ram on my laptop, anything i could do to use it for some *good* purposes?

[03:13] <BONG_IT> the client also is ubuntu
[03:13] <kdns> bsmith093: I assumed you were in here because you'd already tried the basics. My bad. Yes, try a reboot.

[03:13] <OnlyHalfTheTime> Linux never needs a reboot. I'm joking of course. If that fixes it, more power to you
[03:13] <phunyguy> escott, I just remembered what my issue with gvfs and cifs was.... the process would deadlock and freeze up the main system process.
[03:14] <escott> fishcooker, look at /proc/cpuinfo and google the stepping or the name
[03:14] <SuperFunkyFly> kdns do you have a smtp on your server and your ISP blocked port 25?
[03:14] <orbitwhite> kdns, nullmailer maybe? =)
[03:14] <Guest98604> I designed an element to add to linux that reduces performance issues by reprocessing data and creating a smaller data flow....It works a little bit like 7zip data compression.....Not really. I'm off to find the answer to my question. Bye
[03:14] <bsmith093> kdns:  well, ok then, sorry for not trying that already but one of the reasons i switched from vista besides bsod 4 times in 3 months, is the lack of rebooting
[03:14] <kdns> OnlyHalfTheTime: LOL
[03:14] <Orkultus> i gotta run guys
[03:14] <SuperFunkyFly> *=)

[03:14] <nomadis> First time for me to use XChat or anything like it, hi yall
[03:15] <Super_Dog> nomadis:  Hello!
[03:15] <OnlyHalfTheTime> Hi nomadis
[03:15] <kdns> SuperFunkyFly: I'm not running a smtp server. Ubuntu Studio. No ports blocked. But I don't want it to even attempt to send these messages.
[03:15] <SuperFunkyFly> If your ISP blocked port 25 there are ways around that.
[03:15] <PatrickDickey> kdns which log is it in? (Not sure if it matters, but more information is better)
[03:16] <kdns> orbitwhite: lol yes I already googled it and found that it was supposedly apport creating crash logs, and nullmailer sending them
[03:16]  * rootpt is away: bbl
[03:16] <nomadis> I was told I could use this program to get on something called karaoke realm.. but I don't know how..
[03:16] <kdns> orbitwhite: but i don't know how nullmailer is scheduled to check for them, and I already disabled apport but it still appears to be creating these logs.
[03:16] <escott> Super_Dog, those were probably made for 12.04 or earlier. now we have multiarch so you can just apt-get install program:i386 the dependencies
[03:16] <orbitwhite> kdns, how  often do u need apport?
[03:17] <PatrickDickey> kdns: http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/nullmailer.htm
[03:17] <kdns> hi nomadis :)
[03:17] <kdns> I need apport never. This PC is an audio workstation and needs anything fluffy and extra turned off.
[03:17] <BONG_IT> how to update my repo
[03:17] <Super_Dog> escott:  I'm on 12.04 LTS...
[03:17] <orbitwhite> yeah there r always two ways, troubleshooting something u need to work and get rid of something u don't need for real lol
[03:18] <PatrickDickey> BONG_IT: if you're adding a repository, you can use sudo-apt-add-repository or open Software Sources and add it under the "Other Software" tab.
[03:18] <histo> BONG_IT: sudo apt-get update
[03:18] <Blkrdo> My ubuntu is stuck,after booting up,it halts with a violet screen,no icon,no sound,no keys working! Any help?
[03:18] <dr_willis> !nomodeset | Blkrdo
[03:18] <ubottu> Blkrdo: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[03:18] <orbitwhite> Blkrdo, ctrl+alt+f1, does it show black screen with login promt? =)
[03:18] <BONG_IT> when im sudo apt-get update
[03:19] <BONG_IT> i have an error
[03:19] <Blkrdo> Ubottu: thank you
[03:19] <ubottu> You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)
[03:19] <kdns> PatrickDickey: This is appearing in the system log
[03:19] <PatrickDickey> BONG_IT: what/s the error?
[03:19] <kdns> PatrickDickey: Thanks for the link, that might help me stop nullmailer from sending the messages, but what is creating them?
[03:19] <escott> Super_Dog, maybe it was 11.10... the years are blending together
[03:19] <PatrickDickey> kdns, I'm not sure. It might help you to figure that out too.
[03:20] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: no,nothing
[03:20] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: it was working fine 30min back
[03:20] <PatrickDickey> kdns: Also, the answer might be in the entries right before and after that one.
[03:20] <orbitwhite> Blkrdo, what have changed for past 30min?
[03:21] <kdns> PatrickDickey: The entire log is full of these nullmailer messages... It just keeps retrying over and over....
[03:21] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: i guess i just installed codelite
[03:22] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: and a direct shutdown
[03:22] <kdns> bsmith093: You're right that linux generally needs a reboot less often than windows... Don't worry, this reboot is the first in a series of troubleshooting steps, which theoretically could lead you to not needing to reboot it.
[03:22] <orbitwhite> Blkrdo, idk what is this but if it looks like the real reason for ur case, i would log into system over ssh and remove that all looking forward for next steps if necessary
[03:23] <bsmith093> kdns: well that fixed the insane swap fukll swap problem
[03:23] <Guest98604> 40689tseuG
[03:23] <kdns> bsmith093: It's not a fix it's a workaround :) The fix comes after you fnd out what caused it, and then that probem is made to go away forever.
=== SweetBrown is now known as keroz
[03:24] <kdns> bsmith093: You may find that you have an app with a memory leak or something
[03:24] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: but isnt it necesary for my system to be working for tha? How do i troubleshoot it?
[03:24] <lewisou> clear
[03:24] <kdns> hehehe
[03:24] <RomperStomp> Hi i was wondering is there a way to intall or build ubuntu for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1" (similar to nexus 7 style "Native install")?
[03:24] <PatrickDickey> bsmith093: how long had it been since you rebooted last?
[03:25] <bsmith093> PatrickDickey: 17days 3:04 hrs
[03:25] <PatrickDickey> RomperStomp: Try in #ubuntu-phone that's where the fun stuff is at. :)
[03:25] <orbitwhite> Blkrdo, at the current point the most easy way is to troubleshoot it over ssh, if there is any interface left at all i would do it over busybox shell from bootloader if problem doesn't affect it too
[03:25] <kdns> 17 days is a fair while for a workstation.... What's the machine's purpose?
[03:25] <PatrickDickey> bsmith093: One or more of the applications might have a memory leak. That would use up the swap space, as well as RAM.
[03:26] <bsmith093> PatrickDickey: just pidgin gedit and the latest firefox , 18
[03:26] <kdns> Blkrdo: are you able to boot into recovery mode? (Hold shift before grub starts, and it will give you a menu)
[03:26]  * PatrickDickey bingoooooo  
[03:26] <PatrickDickey> FIrefox is notorious for memory hogging. Especially if you have flash running in a window.
[03:26] <kdns> firefox.
[03:27] <kdns> yep.
[03:27] <Blkrdo> Kdns: yup,got recovery mode. now?
[03:27] <orbitwhite> Blkrdo, the first thing to check is if the box is alive or not, if network configured to get up automatically ping will tell u if its dead for real or looks just looks like dead
[03:28] <orbitwhite> recovery mode works too lol
[03:28] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: now how do i use it actualy?
[03:29] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: root shell prompt!
[03:29] <orbitwhite> depends on what u wanna do
[03:29] <kdns> Blkrdo: I was actually checking to see the status of your box, don't actually plan on using recovery mode (not right now anyway) but the fact that it works is what I was after :)
[03:29] <kdns> However... You said you installed new packages... Recovery root prompt is one way to remove them
[03:29] <orbitwhite> i would check logs on root fs under /var/log especially syslog, kern.log and dmesg
[03:29] <Haematoma> where is the config file for USB HDD automount option?
[03:30] <kdns> yes, check the logs!!
[03:30] <Haematoma> I'm looking to create a UDEV rule that executes an RSYNC script whenever i plug in my hDD
[03:30] <kdns> Haematoma: the udev rules are the automount config :)
[03:30] <Haematoma> but I want to make sure that the drive partition(s) have been successfully mounted before the script is executed
[03:30] <orbitwhite> if u're 100% positive that it happened after installing some packages removing it would be a good step to fix it fast way
[03:31] <Haematoma> kdns: do you know of a way to ensure the drive partitions have been mounted before the script is execute?
[03:31] <kdns> Haematoma: I'd parse the output of the mount command.
[03:31] <Haematoma> kdns: I was thinking of using the wait command, but I'm betting that there is a better way of doing it
[03:32] <PatrickDickey> Haematoma: This might point you in the right direction (note, I haven't tried it--only Googled it) http://hackaday.com/2009/09/18/how-to-write-udev-rules/
[03:32] <Haematoma> kdns: thanks
[03:32] <PatrickDickey> Haematoma: I mention it, because they talk about an rsync script when a drive is automounted.
[03:32] <Haematoma> PatrickDickey: thanks. I'll look into it.
[03:33] <kdns> Haematoma: strictly speaking, you want to check for the UUID of your specific drive I guess
[03:33] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: i dont think so! Because its mostly something to do with my graphics driver! I got it while updating the system! But the last two time i re-installed completly,dont wana do ths time!
[03:33] <PatrickDickey> Blkrdo: what kind of card do you have?

[03:35] <orbitwhite> Blkrdo, linux doesn't need to be reinstalled until hardware fail of storage device(s) or lacking of skills, linux gives u more ways to configure it while it brings more responsibility for what was done
[03:35] <kdns> Haematoma: use blkid to look for your drive by UUID, then look for that device node (EG: /dev/sdc) in the output of mount.
[03:35] <PatrickDickey> ghosthole: which graphics card do you have?
[03:35] <orbitwhite> Blkrdo, so u updated it and the driver for ur video adapter was updated too, right?
[03:36] <ghosthole> Radeon 7660g
[03:36] <Haematoma> kdns: Okay... I'm a little unfamiliar with the UNIX mounting process in general. I know there is the /mnt directory and the /media directory, but I don't know the difference between the two.
[03:36] <orbitwhite> i suggested ssh because in that case it would be easy for u to give us ur dmesg, kern.log and syslog from /var/log
[03:36] <PatrickDickey> !nomodset | ghosthole This might help you with the issue also. You'll reboot, and add it to the command line in grub using 'e' to edit.
[03:36] <ghosthole> The one on amd a10
[03:36] <Haematoma> kdns: I assume once a drive partition is properly mounted, the partition ends up in the /media directory, but can't say with certainty.
[03:36] <orbitwhite> and we would find out if the box boots to coma or it is alive actually
[03:37] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: that was last time! This time i made sure not to update! I admit lack of knowlege!
[03:37] <kdns> Haematoma: the udev rules in ubuntu mout most (all?) removable devices to /media
[03:37] <Haematoma> kdns: I'll have to read more I suppose. I'll try not to badger you into an oracle relationship. lol
[03:37] <PatrickDickey> !nomodeset | ghosthole The correct information for what I was trying to point you to.
[03:37] <ubottu> ghosthole The correct information for what I was trying to point you to.: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[03:37] <kdns> Haematoma: and you can find out where your device is mounted by typing ''mount" at a shell
[03:37] <orbitwhite> nah i'm not saying someone is lacking of knowledge, im just trying to state the fact
[03:38] <kdns> Haematoma: however in your case, you will not need to know where the system intends to mount it, but just whether it is mounted, no?
[03:39] <orbitwhite> Blkrdo, u c it is hard to determine what happened to ur system actually, but in order to make sure what was wrong people will ask u for logs
[03:39] <orbitwhite> if u don't know or not sure what happened
[03:39] <Haematoma> kdns: Since the mounted partition ends up in /media, I just need to know the name of the partition.
[03:40] <Haematoma> kdns: but my main concern is ensuring that the partition is properly mounted before my script attempts to rsync
[03:40] <PatrickDickey> Haematoma: is it mounted right now?
[03:40] <orbitwhite> if i were u and my box was configured with automatic network setup, first of all i would check if it gets up it's networking or it is completely dead
[03:40] <kdns> Haematoma: I hope you don't mind if i go backwards for a minute... what's actually the intended use case here?
[03:40] <kdns> ahhhh okay
[03:41] <orbitwhite> if ssh is an option, i would log into system and got back to community support
[03:41] <orbitwhite> otherwise i would boot into recovery mode
[03:41] <kdns> So the idea is, you plug the drive in, and it magically starts a backup for you (or something like that)
[03:41] <orbitwhite> took the logs from root fs
[03:41] <Haematoma> kdns: I run a media server at my house that I share with my roommates. I get tired of transferring media files to their external HDDs, so I set up a script which automatically xfers the files from their respective home download directories onto a selected HDD.
[03:41] <orbitwhite> and came back to coomunity with logs published on pastebin
[03:41] <orbitwhite> in order to figure out what exactly went wrong
[03:42] <PatrickDickey> orbitwhite: would he be able to install, and use pastebinit from recovery mode?
[03:42] <orbitwhite> PatrickDickey, i didn't say that
[03:42] <orbitwhite> sorry for being slow, english is not my primary language
[03:42] <Haematoma> kdns: the script is intended to sync the roommates invidual download folder with their HDD when they plug it in, and then send an email upon completion
[03:42] <PatrickDickey> orbitwhite: No, I'm not saying you did. I'm offering it as a way of him getting the logs on pastebin.
[03:43] <orbitwhite> nothing stops u from using usb storage, ssfs, smbfs or whatever option there is
[03:43] <kdns> Haematoma: Your housemates must think you are awesome.
[03:43] <orbitwhite> i suggested to check if ssh is an option at first matter
[03:43] <orbitwhite> because copy-paste and interactive console rocks for the context of situation
[03:43] <kdns> Haematoma: I guess then, you need a way to detect which housemate's HDD is connected, and then grab the appropriate files for that drive
[03:44] <kdns> ?
[03:44] <PatrickDickey> orbitwhite: agreed totally.
[03:44] <kdns> orbitwhite: +1
[03:44] <Haematoma> kdns: yeah, I already have that part covered... The part i'm struggling with is ensuring that the drive has been successfully mounted.
[03:44] <Haematoma> before the sync script is executed
[03:45] <Haematoma> I can differentiate between drives using serial no(s).
[03:45] <kdns> Haematoma: well that depends on how you detect the drive? Are you using UUId or valume label or file presence or something?
[03:45] <kdns> right, serial number :)
[03:45] <Haematoma> I'm hoping i can use udev to mount the drive from the get go...
[03:45] <Haematoma> and i just put the mount action before the script activation,
[03:46] <kdns> Haematoma: how do you do that? as in, what tool do you use to read the serial number?
[03:46] <Haematoma> udevadm info
[03:46] <orbitwhite> Haematoma, sorry if im saying something non-related but if it is mounted over uuid or label it would be easy to check this fact over grepping /proc/mounts
[03:47] <kdns> orbitwhite: that's on point mate, definitely related, I said something similar earlier :)
[03:47] <Haematoma> orbitwhite: Kk thanks. I'll have to read more about that.
[03:47] <orbitwhite> if something is not mounted, it won;t be present into there for sure
[03:47] <kdns> Haematoma: I would not try to do all this in udev scripts, I'd simply use udev to pass an argument to your script, and do most of the work in bash.
[03:48] <funtapaz> Now that was weird.
[03:48] <funtapaz> Just managed to get CUPS to eat up every bit of disk space after trying to print to an IPP printer.
[03:48] <orbitwhite> messing with system key components (is udev one? ^_^) is not a good idea until u know for sure what r u doing
[03:48] <Haematoma> kdns: Kk. Thank you for your help.
[03:49] <funtapaz> Ubuntu then failed to boot, and I had to use sysrescuecd to clear out some files in /var/spool/
[03:49] <Haematoma> orbitwhite: I'm not too worried, its an individual rule file with low priority, and the rule is to activate a script.
[03:49] <funtapaz> Anyone ever heard of something like that?
[03:49] <Blkrdo> Orbitwhite: it worked with the nomodeset in the grub! What does it signifies?
[03:50] <orbitwhite> Blkrdo, http://askubuntu.com/questions/207175/what-does-nomodeset-do
[03:50] <mribeirodantas> I just came to say it worked out afterwards :)
[03:50] <orbitwhite> Haematoma, oh ok =)
[03:50] <mribeirodantas> Thank you dr_willis and m something :$
[03:50] <mribeirodantas> malkauns:  :D
[03:50] <mribeirodantas> Good night! (it's vuln)
[03:50] <malkauns> yo
[03:51] <malkauns> got it working?
[03:53] <orbitwhite> i heard gnome devs told they will pay more attention for classic mode rather than they did for now, is that true? (soz 4 my retarded english)
[03:54] <PatrickDickey> orbitwhite: I haven't heard anything, but that doesn't mean much. I really haven't looked into it, because I either use Unity or Lubuntu.
[03:55] <JoeCoolDesk> When I go to install mysql I get this: http://pastebin.com/r75qCq9x
[03:56] <orbitwhite> i just got used to gnome since debian sarge and i liked it so much after they implemeted tabs in nautilus that i can't make myself to get used to something else
[03:56] <dr_willis> orbitwhite: id heard it was scheduled for removal in the next year or sommmm.
[03:56] <orbitwhite> oh god that hurts =)
[03:56] <dr_willis> im suprised its still around
[03:57] <orbitwhite> i'm using mate but i feel like its just a dirty hack for real
[03:57] <dr_willis> gnome2 in many ways was a dirty hack .. then they tried to clean it up by removeing features people wanted. :)
[03:58] <dr_willis> Then again. i rember back when the 'ximian gnome' fork came out. so im old..
[03:58] <orbitwhite> worked for me, the reason why its gone talking of interface style is that they started messing with touchscreens imho
[03:58] <PatrickDickey> JoeCoolDesk: you can either try sudo dpkg --configure -a or sudo apt-get install -f and see if one of them finishes the installation.
[03:58] <JoeCoolDesk> install -f brings that same error
[03:59] <CorpSamich> Hey, would someone be able to help me with some Win8 and 12.10 problems with Dual booting?
[03:59] <orbitwhite> D:
[03:59] <PatrickDickey> JoeCoolDesk: is there any other messages right before the ones you pastebinned?
[03:59] <JoeCoolDesk> PatrickDickey: Errors were encountered while processing: mysql-server
[03:59] <JoeCoolDesk> For dpackage configure
[04:00] <PatrickDickey> CorpSamich: what issues are you having? Someone may be able to help out.
[04:01] <PatrickDickey> JoeCoolDesk: Could you pastebin everything that you got when you originally tried to install? I mean after it downloaded the files.
[04:01] <JoeCoolDesk> PatrickDickey, sure.
[04:02] <CorpSamich> Ah, I pretty much followed everything for setting it up to dual boot like I have on my Desktop with Win7, also disabling Fast/safe boot stuff that's been put into Win8. Everything downloaded fine and installed correctly, and I can't seem to find a way to get back to Win8. The bootmanager screen that you'd normally see on Win8 doesn't appear when I restart. Anyway to fix this?
[04:03] <dr_willis> CorpSamich: so the grub menu shows no win8 entry?
=== asilhouette is now known as nirose
[04:03] <JoeCoolDesk> PatrickDickey: http://pastebin.com/NReph3Nr
[04:03] <orbitwhite> there is a topic on google from 2009 with something similar to this apt and mysql problem and guy said it fixed things http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1126169.html thats so weird
[04:03] <PatrickDickey> CorpSamich: when you restart, does it take you to a grub menu, or just boot into ubuntu?
=== nirose is now known as Nirose
[04:03] <CorpSamich> Just into Ubuntu. I see my Toshiba Startup logo and then it boots directly in.
[04:03] <orbitwhite> oops, not the case
[04:07] <dr_willis> CorpSamich:  its possible windows8 is so new - you may need to add a custom entry for it in the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file
[04:07] <kfizz> I'm using "Disks" in Ubuntu 12.10 and I'm trying to set a drive to mount at start up. One of the default options is x-gvfs-show and it's an unrecognized mount option according to dmesg. What is x-gvfs-show? Should I just delete it from the mount options?
[04:07] <dr_willis> kfizz:  id just make a /etc/fstab entry by hand. Ive heard of some people breaking things badly using the gui disk mounting config tools
[04:08] <kfizz> dr_willis, that was my 2nd choice and what I was planning on eventually doing. I had just never seen x-gvfs-show before as a mount option and wasn't sure what it did.
[04:09] <jakepiano> well i have another problem with the ethernet. it was working about an hour ago and now its not recognizing at all. how do i fix it again?
[04:09] <PatrickDickey> Well that was a fun flight out the door. LOL :S
[04:10] <Sylphie> jakepiano, a fix that only lasts an hour maybe wasn't really fixed
[04:11] <PatrickDickey> JoeCoolDesk: has anyone else given you any suggestions? I crashed right after you pastebinned the second link.
[04:11] <JoeCoolDesk> PatrickDickey, no.  Mysql told me to come here.
[04:11] <JoeCoolDesk> http://pastebin.com/NReph3Nr
[04:11] <orbitwhite> JoeCoolDesk, i found exactly similar case like urs, eventually dude built the package my hands from sources and it worked, i'm 100% positive it is ur case
[04:11] <PatrickDickey> Well, what I see is "ERROR: There's not enough space in /var/lib/mysql/" which tells me that your drive might be full.
[04:11] <JoeCoolDesk> orbitwhite: link?
[04:11] <jakepiano> Sylphie no it was working for the past couple days. it just stopped all of a sudden

[04:12] <c2tarun> hi friends, can anyone please tell me how to disable default bluetooth app in ubuntu 12.04 and make blueman as default. I am having two bluetooth apps working right now. http://imagebin.org/242960
[04:12] <graft> hey does anyone know how to install computer modern as a font?
[04:12] <modifier> how to add backup created by aptoncd as repository rather than restoring it to apt ?
[04:12] <orbitwhite> same guy another forum, russian
[04:12] <orbitwhite> http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/admin/7898528#comments
[04:12] <Sylphie> jakepiano, what was the problem?
[04:12] <c2tarun> Startup application is not showing system bluetooth application
[04:12] <dr_willis> c2tarun:  one may be auto starting from /etc/xdg/autostart  (I think) thats the ssytem wide autostart directory.
[04:12] <PatrickDickey> !font | graft
[04:12] <ubottu> graft: Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto - No fonts in Flash? Install "msttcorefonts" (from !Multiverse), "gsfonts", and "gsfonts-x11". For the official ubuntu font, see: http://font.ubuntu.com/
[04:13] <dr_willis> c2tarun:  those are hidden from the users auto start config tools
[04:13] <JoeCoolDesk> PatrickDickey, any way to see disk usage in CLI?
[04:13] <Sylphie> JoeCoolDesk \ "df"
[04:13] <PatrickDickey> JoeCoolDesk: du is the tool. Do you not have a desktop installed?
[04:13] <JoeCoolDesk> PatrickDickey, it's a server.
[04:13] <kdns> For those who were helping me, thanks very much, I found that the messages were created by the daily and weekly cron scripts, and if nullmailer is not present, the messages are not only not sent, but not created (as nullmailer provides the method for the messages to be placed in the queue, without it, the cron script can't create the messages)
[04:14] <kdns> so purging nulmailer was my solution.
[04:14] <PatrickDickey> JoeCoolDesk: Sylphie's response is better.
[04:14] <jakepiano> Sylphie well i was connected to the internet via ethernet and i was running a virtual box, it had a freeze for a moment and then the internet wasn't working at all. once i restarted the computer the ethernet wasn't showing up at all. i just need to know how to get it back to functionality
[04:15] <c2tarun> dr_willis, ok, I have these in that directory: blueman.desktop  bluetooth-applet.desktop  bluetooth-applet-unity.desktop   I think deleting or rename last two will do the job right?
[04:15] <daftykins> jakepiano: do you get anything from 'ifconfig -a' in a terminal?
[04:15] <Sylphie> jakepiano, so you are running linux from a VM of windows?
[04:15] <JoeCoolDesk> Well how about that, no disk space.
[04:15] <dr_willis> c2tarun:  i normally make a autorun.disabled in the parent directory and move them there.
[04:15] <PatrickDickey> JoeCoolDesk: sudo apt-get autoclean will help with that.
[04:15] <orbitwhite> jakepiano, bring us ur lspci please
[04:15] <jakepiano> Sylphie no i have linux as the primary os
[04:15] <modifier> how to add backup created by aptoncd as repository rather than restoring it to apt ?
[04:16] <c2tarun> dr_willis, good idea, thanks :)
[04:16] <PatrickDickey> JoeCoolDesk: Maybe, but it might not work, since you're in the middle of a failed installation.
[04:16] <jakepiano> daftykins the eth0 doesn't show up
[04:16] <jakepiano> daftykins just lo and lan0
[04:16] <Sylphie> jakepiano, do you have a hub or switch with lights to tell whether you are connected?
[04:16] <jakepiano> orbitwhite whats that?
[04:16] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: do you see an indicator for the network in your panel? Either two arrows or a pie slice?
[04:17] <orbitwhite> jakepiano, `lspci` says what devices u have on pci bus including ur network controller
[04:17] <daftykins> jakepiano: this is the host OS ja?
[04:17] <jakepiano> Sylphie yeah the hub has a orange and green light that are lit whether its plugged in or not
[04:18] <orbitwhite> after what i would check if everything is fine with module by grepping it through dmesg log
[04:18] <jakepiano> PatrickDickey no i don't. i know it should be there but its not at all
[04:18] <jakepiano> daftykins yes linux is the host
[04:18] <orbitwhite> could u please show us `lspci` command output?
[04:18] <modifier> anyone - how to add backup created by aptoncd as repository rather than restoring it to apt ??
[04:18] <Sylphie> jakepiano, so if the lights are lit that means you are connected hardware-wise, just something is being lost in the software
[04:19] <JoeCoolDesk> Alright, mysql running.  But now my sites are blank.
[04:19] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: not a problem. pastebin the results of lspci then. We'll help you from there.
[04:19] <orbitwhite> :/
[04:19] <daftykins> jakepiano: ja pastebin the 'lspci' output for the others then
[04:19] <jakepiano> Sylphie yes i believe so.
[04:19] <PatrickDickey> modifier: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/APTonCD may help.
[04:20] <jakepiano> i haven't done a pastebin before what do i do?
[04:20] <dr_willis> !pastebinit
[04:20] <ubottu> pastebinit is the command-line equivalent of !pastebin - Command output, or other text can be redirected to pastebinit, which then reports an URL containing the output - To use pastebinit, install the « pastebinit » package from a package manager - Simple usage: command | pastebinit -b http://paste.ubuntu.com
[04:20]  * orbitwhite :-* ubottu 
[04:20] <PatrickDickey> Um, shoot....  He won't be able to pastebin, since he doesn't have Internet.
[04:20] <dr_willis> ;)
[04:20] <jakepiano> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1533310/
[04:20] <jakepiano> here it is
[04:20] <orbitwhite> he has irc how comes he doesn't have internet
[04:21] <jakepiano> all i typed in to the command was lspci. is that right?
[04:21] <Sylphie> because it's inside a VM
[04:21] <jakepiano> and no i'm not running linux from a vm
[04:21] <jakepiano> its the host
[04:21] <orbitwhite> jakepiano, the problem is with a wired network interface right?
[04:21] <kdns> Good lord, does nobody f***ing google before they come in here?
[04:21] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: You're connected via wireless right now. "lan0" is probably your wireless connection.
[04:22] <orbitwhite> i can't see the wired one =)
[04:22] <kdns> The topic should say: If you haven't googled your problem for at least three hours, go away.
[04:22] <daftykins> kdns: you're shocked? :)
[04:22] <jakepiano> yes it is. but i need to connect to the the internet
[04:22] <jakepiano> orbitwhite yes i believe so
[04:22] <Sylphie> kdns, sometimes you don't know the right question to search for
[04:22] <kdns> daftykins: LOL yeh totally dude... it's been like this in here since forever... I guess it never ceases to amaze me.
[04:22] <orbitwhite> jakepiano, it is a very bad sign, bring us ur `dmesg`
[04:23] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: You need what connected to the Internet? I realize that sounds strange, but if you're on the computer right now, it IS connected to the Internet.
[04:23] <daftykins> definitely no wired interface there
[04:23] <kdns> Sylphie: of course! :D google doesn't answer everything. But it certainly has the answer to 90% of the issues in here.
[04:23] <orbitwhite> he needs his wired interface working i assume
[04:23] <blkadder> You sure?
[04:24] <blkadder> Perhaps it would be easier for all involved if none of the interfaces worked.
[04:24] <orbitwhite> in ur case too
[04:24] <jakepiano> yes i know its connected to the internet. i want to connect via the ethernet port. the university's wifi is very slow. wired is a lot faster.
[04:24] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: if you haven't seen the other requests, could you pastebin the results of dmesg please?
[04:24] <orbitwhite> i suspect we won't see anything interesting in dmesg and ethernet is dead =)
[04:25] <jakepiano> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1533317/
[04:25] <jakepiano> well i had this problem when i first installed ubuntu and it got fixed but i can't remember how. it was through a few commands and downloads
[04:25] <Sylphie> jakepiano, was this a builtin ethernet port, or an addon card?
[04:26] <orbitwhite> motherboard or laptop model at least
[04:27] <jakepiano> it was built in and its built in
[04:27] <jakepiano> sorry its built in and on a laptop
[04:27] <orbitwhite> laptop model plz
[04:27] <jakepiano> i'm on a lenovo g480
[04:27] <orbitwhite> thx
[04:27] <Sylphie> jakepiano, if it's builtin, it's possible it might have gotten shut off in the bios (theoretically)
[04:28] <jakepiano> i checked the bios already. enabled and renabled it. still not working
[04:29] <daftykins> orbitwhite: atheros?
[04:29] <Sylphie> jakepiano, strange, if it wasn't functioning it shouldn't be lighting the switch
[04:30] <orbitwhite> daftykins, AR8162
[04:30] <jakepiano> yeah its really weird. i'm not sure whats going on.
[04:30] <daftykins> Sylphie: they can be broken permanently lit too
[04:30] <jakepiano> well nothing i did messed it up i hope. the only thing i was doing was running windows on a virtual box when it stopped working
[04:31] <PatrickDickey> jake, do you have the vm running right now?
[04:31] <daftykins> orbitwhite: worth grep'ing his 'history' maybe?
[04:31] <daftykins> orbitwhite: since he fixed it already once
[04:31] <orbitwhite> people complain about it saying latest compat-wireless solves the problem but its weird that we don't see the device on the list
[04:31] <JoeCoolDesk> Thanks PatrickDickey, site's back up.
[04:31] <PatrickDickey> Awesome JoeCoolDesk. :)
[04:31] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: do you have the virtual machine running right now?
[04:32] <jakepiano> PatrickDickey no i'm not
[04:32] <Sylphie> jakepiano \ as a workaround, does your Lenovo have any pcm slots for an addon ethernet which could be really cheap
[04:32] <jakepiano> pcm?
[04:32] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: try starting it, and see what happens. (Yes, I have odd solutions)
[04:32] <PatrickDickey> The little slot on the side of the laptop. PCMCIA slot.
[04:33] <Sylphie> jakepiano \ pcmcia or cardbus, those credit card sized ethernet cards
[04:33] <jakepiano> no i don't
[04:34] <Sylphie> jakepiano \ I thought pcm slots came standard on laptops. shame on Lenovo
[04:34] <orbitwhite> that is weird, i have blanks in my knowledges but is it possible due to lack of some firmware that we don't see the device on simple `lspci` output?
[04:34] <RomperStomp> patrick i went to ubuntu-phone no one is answering my question about putting ubuntu on my samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1" the channel seems dead
[04:34] <orbitwhite> but atheros is kinda *opensource* chipset
[04:34] <PatrickDickey> orbitwhite: I think it's tied into the wireless. The wired is an Atheros NIC.
[04:34] <jakepiano> so is there anything to fix the ethernet? or is it just dead?
[04:35] <PatrickDickey> RomperStomp: I don't know what to tell you. That's where they're working on it at. Sorry.
[04:35] <orbitwhite> PatrickDickey, 02:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)
[04:35] <orbitwhite> i suspect its not possible
[04:35] <daftykins> pretty sure wireless and wired chips are never the same
[04:35] <Sylphie> jakepiano \ if it is dead and you have no pcm slots, there's always usb ethernet
[04:36] <logi> hi
[04:36] <daftykins> Sylphie: PCMCIA has been dead for years. PC Express cards are rare as nobody really used them. planning for the hardware to be dead so quickly and easily is a terrible comment to a user :P
[04:36] <arussel> Hi, is there a ip blacklisting package for apache ? somethign that would get blacklisted IPs from a server and add them to my deny host of apache.
[04:36] <logi> who can help me? i'am having a problem installing ubuntu
[04:37] <logi> someone?>
[04:37] <jakepiano> so is there nothing to fix it? i fixed it before. i'm not sure why we can't fix it now
[04:37] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: try sudo lshw -C network and pastebin the results please.
[04:37] <Sylphie> jakepiano \ I'd recommend the Asix ax88178 usb ethernet, as long as you're are using the newest drivers. even slightly old drivers and it won't work
[04:37] <orbitwhite> `lshw -C network`
[04:38] <blkadder> arussel: There might be but it would be pretty trivial to implement yourself.
[04:38] <logi> somebody who can help me?
[04:38] <somsip> arussel: you could try something like this and there are a few variants: http://perishablepress.com/ultimate-htaccess-blacklist/
[04:38] <orbitwhite> logi, what is the problem?
[04:38] <logi> i cant install ubuntu
[04:38] <orbitwhite> that is not the problem
[04:38] <logi> i am trying to install 12.10
[04:38] <jakepiano> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1533345/
[04:39] <PatrickDickey> logi, a little more information is needed. How are you trying to install it, and what kind of errors are you getting?
[04:39] <orbitwhite> jakepiano, `lshw -C network`
[04:39] <logi> when it finishes loading some files at the beginning it will boot me to a black screen
[04:39] <arussel> somsip: thanks for the link
[04:40] <jakepiano> its posted
[04:40] <logi> i use USB btw
[04:40] <PatrickDickey> logi, Try pressing CTRL + Alt+ F1 and tell us if it brings you to a prompt.
[04:40] <somsip> arussel: no worries. Personally I find these to be too much and quite out of date. I'd recommend Fail2Ban
[04:40] <logi> ok i'll try
[04:40] <arussel> blkadder: probably, but I'm a dev, not a sys ad, and this is for a site already in prod, too many chances I screw somehting :-)
[04:40] <orbitwhite> logi, nothing u can see on black screen after bios messages? any wornings or errors during installation process?
[04:40] <phunyguy> can anyone help me with a linux ping command question? I can't seem to tell it to wait 30 seconds for a response, before failing and returning it's failure error code. I tried the -w and -W command line options, and it still ignores that, failing after a few seconds.
[04:41] <Sylphie> phunyguy \ "ping -t timeoutinseconds"
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[04:42] <phunyguy> I have a keepalive script for sshfs, which relies on that ping to see if the network is active.  If not, it kills the sshfs process as to not lock up the system, and free up resources.  When copying files, it creates enough latency to make a ping timeout, therefore killing the connection
[04:43] <phunyguy> Sylphie, I was under the impression that was "ttl", which is how many hops to take before failing
[04:43] <phunyguy> (router hops)
[04:43] <jakepiano> alright well if theres nothing else that can be done thanks for the analysis
[04:43] <blkadder> ttl = time to live
[04:43] <Sylphie> phunyguy \ I thought ttl was "-m"
[04:43] <phunyguy> maybe I read the wrong man page
[04:43] <phunyguy> nope, -t did nothing
[04:44] <Sylphie> oh well
[04:44] <phunyguy> -m is mark
[04:44] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: you could try rebooting again, without the ethernet cable plugged in. Then reboot once with it plugged in. (I'll admit I'm going through things I've done in the past).
[04:44] <Sylphie> jakepiano \ if do you can some way to boot windows w/o a VM?
[04:45] <jakepiano> PatrickDickey yeah ive tried it but i can do it again
[04:45] <orbitwhite> jakepiano, `lshw -C network`
[04:45] <orbitwhite> u forgot that "network" part
[04:45] <jakepiano> Sylphie no not really. i've gone through hell to try and get both working and i finally did, but now with the ethernet not working i'm frustrated
[04:45] <orbitwhite> thats where we stucked
[04:46] <Sylphie> So Jake's ethernet isn't on lspci or lshw?
[04:46] <orbitwhite> we still have to make sure =)
[04:46] <logi> i pressed ctrl+alt+f1 but nothing happened
[04:46] <jakepiano> orbitwhite http://paste.ubuntu.com/1533362/
[04:47] <orbitwhite> now we're sure there is no one
[04:47] <logi> please someone help me
[04:47] <orbitwhite> and it is dead or it is some sort of hardware fail
[04:47] <PatrickDickey> phunyguy: one site I found recommends installing fping instead of ping.
[04:47] <Sylphie> some ethernet cards need a firmware download at boot time
[04:48] <jakepiano> orbitwhite well i had it working an hour ago so i'm assuming its a hardware or software fail
[04:48] <orbitwhite> Sylphie, it is atheros card
[04:48] <phunyguy> oooh cool, thanks, let me try that, PatrickDickey
[04:48] <logi> hi patrick
[04:48] <logi> i did what u told me
[04:48] <logi> but nothing happend
[04:48] <jakepiano> orbitwhite what firmware download could i get
[04:48] <logi> any suggestions??
[04:48] <apocalysque> anyone have any luck getting ubuntu 12.04 to work on PPC?  getting stuck @ boot @ a screen says "calling quiesce" using live boot option.  how can i log the boot to found out what problem is?
[04:48] <PatrickDickey> Hi logi.I saw that. When you did the install, did it actually get to the point where it said "Installation complete. You must reboot the system."
[04:49] <logi> no
[04:49] <orbitwhite> i'm a bit stucked into old times but lenovo wasn't friendly for linux as i remember however atheros was always close to opensource world
[04:49] <logi> i am stucked at the beginning
[04:49] <orbitwhite> and they gave up everything necessary to develop opensource drivers so i doubt there is some lack of firmware for it
[04:49] <Sylphie> jakepiano \ One solution I've seen for atheros ethernet is to use ndiswapper
[04:49] <PatrickDickey> logi, so it never even started to install? You haven't even got to the "Try Ubuntu" or "Install Ubuntu" screen?
[04:50] <jakepiano> ndiswapper?
[04:50] <kdns> jakepiano: maybe try a live USB distro to see if it is hardware or software...?
[04:50] <Sylphie> jakepiano \ ndiswrapper (sorry) in conjunction with a windows driver
[04:50] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: change the network to bridge on the lshw command, and pastebin that please? (On my system, my wired is under bridge --not network)
[04:50] <logi> yeah i got there, then i clicked install Ubuntu then it will load some files right? after that the screen will be black
[04:51] <jakepiano> PatrickDickey what exactly is that command?
[04:51] <PatrickDickey> logi, try rebooting and choose "Try Ubuntu"
[04:51] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: lshw -C bridge
[04:51] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: sudo lshw -C bridge sorry (it will want to be ran as root)
[04:52] <jakepiano> PatrickDickey http://paste.ubuntu.com/1533372/
[04:53] <Sylphie> jakepiano \ if all else fails maybe you could try "ndiswrapper" along with the windows driver
[04:53] <orbitwhite> jakepiano, do u windows on dual boot on ur laptop?
[04:53] <jakepiano> yeah i could try it
[04:53] <orbitwhite> just curious if it works at all
[04:53] <jakepiano> orbitwhite i have windows as a vm
[04:54] <PatrickDickey> ok, I'm at a loss now. jakepiano. You could try booting back into a Live CD, and see if it finds your wired. If it does, then you know it's something with your current installation. If not, then it *could* be hardware related.
[04:54] <jakepiano> alright well i'll see what i can do then
[04:55] <orbitwhite> google says ethernet card on his laptop should be on lspci
[04:55] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: if you boot to a Live CD, do lspci again, and look to see if it shows both connectors. You can also do the sudo lshw -C network as well.
[04:55] <orbitwhite> no doubts
[04:55] <orbitwhite> lspci -nn | grep 0200
[04:55] <orbitwhite> but it is not present and dmesg was keeping silence for all the time
[04:56] <orbitwhite> i bet at this current moment it doesn't work physically due to some hardware related reasons
[04:57] <logi> hey patrick.. i do not hve the option "try ubuntu" I only have "livemode","Install","File integrity check" and "memory test"
[04:57] <PatrickDickey> I'm thinking it's something to do with virtualbox and when that crashed. Maybe ubuntu is still thinking it's a virtual bridge. But, I'm not sure how to find out.
[04:57] <PatrickDickey> logi which version of Ubuntu are you trying to install?
[04:57] <orbitwhite> those r separate things
[04:57] <orbitwhite> nothing related to virtualbox
[04:57] <logi> 12.10 desktop AMD64
[04:58] <PatrickDickey> logi, first do the integrity test, and then "live mode".
[04:58] <Brombomb> I'm running server at home as a media server (DLNA, UPnP).  Is there a way to play audio out to a connected speaker system?
[04:58] <PatrickDickey> logi, you are running a 64-bit computer, right?
[04:58] <Hwkiller> does gwibber's facebook feed work for anyone here in 12.10?
[04:58] <logi> yes
[04:59] <PatrickDickey> Hwkiller: do you have the account authorized in "Online Accounts" (Settings > Online Accounts)
[04:59] <logi> it boots me to a black screen
[04:59] <logi> what should i do?
[05:00] <dr_willis> !nomodeset
[05:00] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[05:00] <PatrickDickey> logi, do you mean when you try live mode? or when you try the integrity test?
[05:00] <orbitwhite> something with video mode
[05:00] <logi> integrity test
[05:00] <orbitwhite> yeah nomodset again maybe hah
[05:00] <PatrickDickey> dr_willis: how would he get that to work in the installer (Live DVD)?
[05:00] <Hwkiller> PatrickDickey: yeah; i've also tried removing all configuration and trying again; removing config from facebook itself
[05:00] <Hwkiller> nothing works
[05:01] <dr_willis> PatrickDickey:  i beluve the url shows how to get into the options screen from the cd.
[05:01] <dr_willis> space at the man=keyboard icon, then F5
[05:01] <PatrickDickey> dr_willis: ok. I hadn't read it.
[05:02] <PatrickDickey> Hwkiller: I'm not sure then. I haven't used Gwibber with facebook statuses. Only empathy with my facebook messenger.
[05:02] <logi> hey patrick..my monitor ledlight is blinking
[05:02] <PatrickDickey> Brombomb: do you have a music application installed on the server?
[05:02] <phunyguy> PatrickDickey, so far so good!  Thanks!~
[05:03] <PatrickDickey> logi: did you check the link that dr_willis gave you? !nomodeset It might be the solution to your problem.
[05:03] <Brombomb> PatrickDickey: I have music files on the server, and DLNA apps (plex/mediatomb)
[05:03] <PatrickDickey> logi: you can type !nomodeset to get the link again.
[05:03] <Brombomb> It's a headless/cli only server
[05:04] <Brombomb> so no
[05:04] <orbitwhite> Brombomb, u can use some console player of ur own choice
[05:04] <Brombomb> but I need something that I can control via UPnP/DLNA any reccomendations?
[05:05] <Brombomb> preferrably with an Android device
[05:05] <orbitwhite> oh, now i got it, i only heard about dlna but maybe some player with web interface could fit :/
[05:05] <PatrickDickey> Brombomb: http://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&tbo=d&sclient=psy-ab&q=command%20line%20music%20players%20ubuntu&oq=&gs_l=&pbx=1&fp=4ed87bf74c3b6306&ion=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&bvm=bv.41018144,d.aWM&biw=1624&bih=891 should give you a start.
[05:06] <PatrickDickey> So, you don't want to play the music through the server. You need a compatible player for your other computer?
[05:06] <Brombomb> I want to play the music off the server but remote control it through an interface (web/mobile)
[05:07] <orbitwhite> from the context i assumed that dlna protocol allows to control player remotely, the player itself needs to be run on media server
[05:07] <henry_> hello
[05:07] <orbitwhite> so android box will act as a remote
[05:08] <henry_> I'm having issues installing nodefront and roots(both won't download), can someone help me?
[05:08] <PatrickDickey> henry_: how are you trying to download them, and what messages do you get when you try?
[05:09] <henry_> I'm using npm install -g nodefront(roots)
[05:09] <henry_> i get issues with js-yaml1.0.3 not being installed(for nodefront) and a couple other errors
[05:09] <PatrickDickey> Brombomb: one of your dlna/ apps should have a configuration for remote access. Then you just need to find a DLNA remote app for your android device.
[05:10] <PatrickDickey> henry_: could you pastebin the exact messages you get from when you try npm install -g nodefront(roots) to the end?
[05:10] <henry_> yupp
[05:10] <henry_> 1 moment
[05:10] <orbitwhite> Brombomb, im totally lost and not sure, but maybe u should look at vlc features
[05:11] <Brombomb> thanks for the suggestions guys
[05:12] <logi> PatrickDickey
[05:12] <logi> what are you saying a while back?
[05:12] <PatrickDickey> No problem Brombomb. Sorry we couldn't be more help. There might be a channel for dlna on here though.
[05:12] <logi> hows the !nomodeset?
=== ozzloy_ is now known as ozzloy
[05:12] <Brombomb> good idea!
[05:12] <PatrickDickey> !nomodeset | logi this is what was suggested that you try.
[05:12] <ubottu> logi this is what was suggested that you try.: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[05:12] <Brombomb> I also asked in the #ubuntu-server channel
[05:13] <henry_> PatrickDickey: http://pastebin.com/8gJLFi2D
[05:13] <orbitwhite> Brombomb, is that something that fits? http://ushare.geexbox.org/
[05:14] <logi> i dont get :D
[05:14] <logi> can you explain in to me
[05:14] <Brombomb> this works out.... As in shares media from server to device...
[05:15] <Brombomb> I need the other direction
[05:15] <orbitwhite> so it should be sortadlna hub that works in both directions right?
[05:15] <logi> i'll just select nomodeset from the F6 menu?
[05:15] <Brombomb> ya more or less....
[05:16] <Brombomb> I've got it serving up media just fine
[05:16] <Brombomb> now I want it to accept "commands" (play/pause) to play the content locally... and come out of speakers attached to the server
[05:17] <henry_> PatrickDickey: My friend has also attempted to manually install js-yaml(before i reinstalled Ubuntu 12.10)
=== luke is now known as RNK6
[05:17] <henry_> PatrickDickey: Even after fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10 it still doesn't want to install for the same reason
[05:17] <logi> patrick what should I do now?
[05:18] <Hannofcart> This is slightly offtopic but I don't know where else to ask... I just installed the Athena Widget library (libXaw7 and libXaw7-dev) which I need for devloping an application. However, I find that libXaw.so installed in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu has no symbols defined in it
[05:18] <Hannofcart> Why?!
[05:19] <logi> should i select acpi=off?
[05:21] <orbitwhite> Brombomb, appears that basically there are DLNA server, DLNA player and DLNA control point which connects first two in various directions, looks like MiniDLNA fits
[05:21] <PatrickDickey> henry_: You might be able to get more help in /join #node.js
[05:21] <dr_willis> Dlna is fun. ;)
[05:22] <henry_> ok will do thank you
[05:22] <dr_willis> minidlna and ushare are both handy if you need a simple dlna server
[05:22] <logi> do i need to do some typing of commands?
[05:22] <PatrickDickey> logi, yes. One second, and I'll look at the link I gave you to make sure of what to do.
[05:23] <logi> ok thanks, you're great :D
[05:23] <orbitwhite> dr_willis, so if there is a NAS stock with MiniDLNA, plasma and android phone, can i show what i filmed with my phone on tv holding only phone in my hands?
[05:23] <ripthejacker> how do i add apps to notification tray whitelist using dconf or gsettings
[05:24] <PatrickDickey> logi: on the page that ubottu gave you, do you see where it says to enable it on the Live CD?
[05:24] <PatrickDickey> How to enable kernel options on the livecd (before install)
[05:24] <bluebomber> I have an LG Blu-Ray burner drive that reads and burns CD-Rs and DVD+Rs fine in Ubuntu (using Brasero), and it recognizes a BD-R disc inserted, but cannot burn to it. Can anyone help?
[05:25] <logi> yeah
[05:25] <logi> then?
[05:25] <ripthejacker> please help how to edit dconf ?
[05:25] <orbitwhite> bluebomber, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CdDvd/Burning
[05:25] <dr_willis> orbitwhite:  Hmm.. I got an Xios ARM based HTPC-micro box the other day. It does DLNA via xbmc, and has android 4.0.4 i bevlive
[05:25] <PatrickDickey> logi: When you get to the screen that has "live mode" "install" etc, that's where you'll Press F6. You should see the option of "nomodeset" there. Click it, then click whichever option you want above (Live mode or install).
[05:26] <dr_willis> orbitwhite:  i got xbmc onmy android phone and tablets now also
[05:26] <logi> i was redirected to the ubuntu logo with moving dots below it
[05:26] <orbitwhite> dr_willis, so dlna allows u to stream something from one device to another? D:
[05:27] <PatrickDickey> logi, did you get to that screen at all before?
[05:27] <orbitwhite> like from tablet#1 to phone
[05:27] <dr_willis> orbitwhite:  i stream from one xbmc box to the other  all the time.
[05:27] <orbitwhite> and backwards
[05:27] <logi> and then an error message says "could not load file..... " i cannot see it clearly cause it is so fast
[05:27] <logi> i did
[05:28] <dr_willis> dlna = upnp -  a video 'streaming' service ..
=== pug is now known as Guest41110
[05:28] <logi> and my screen will be black again
[05:28] <PatrickDickey> Is it black now?
[05:28]  * orbitwhite gone to read about dlna protocol i can't understand what it does and why, wtf why not to mount something and listen from there lol
[05:29] <logi> yeah and my monitor's led is blinking
[05:29] <logi> i have no response
[05:29]  * PatrickDickey thought about setting dlna up on my home server...
[05:29] <dr_willis> orbitwhite:  mount how? :) it replaces the need to mount. since things can appear/vanish on the fly.
[05:29]  * ripthejacker needs help editinf dconf or gsettings
[05:30] <ripthejacker> *editing
[05:30] <orbitwhite> why someone needs replace for mount :/
[05:30] <dr_willis> My android phone connects to teh  home network. I can have it play a video from thephone to the tv via dlna
[05:30] <dr_willis> orbitwhite:  ever have a mounted network server disconnect?
[05:30] <orbitwhite> oh thats what i was asking about
[05:30] <orbitwhite> now i got it
[05:30] <PatrickDickey> logi, The only other thing I can suggest is downloading a different DVD. The Alternate or Server DVD, or Minimal install DVD, and installing from that. When you burn it, make sure you set the burn speed to the LOWEST setting.  You can always install ubuntu-desktop afterwards.
[05:30] <dr_willis> Samsung calls their dlna stuff 'allshare'
[05:30] <Brombomb> but I have my server hosting the content so I can get it on my phone/ps3/tv
[05:30] <orbitwhite> no i never had mounted server to disconnect
[05:31] <orbitwhite> i got serious vpn network around everywhere in my place
[05:31] <ripthejacker> please help with dconf
[05:31] <logi> how about havin it installed through USB?
[05:31] <orbitwhite> resistant to disconnects lol
[05:31] <Brombomb> but what I want now is to have the content on the server, play locally on that server, but control it with my devices (android, ps3 etc)
[05:31] <logi> can you suggest any bootable USB maker?
[05:31] <Brombomb> what OS logi
[05:31] <logi> ubuntu 12.10
[05:31] <logi> desktop amd64
[05:32] <dr_willis> logi:  dozens of linux to usb tools at the 'pendrivelinux'  web site
[05:32] <dr_willis> logi:  or you can image teh iso straight to USB
[05:32] <PatrickDickey> Brombomb: He's trying to install Ubuntu 12.10, but it won't load the installer. It just goes to a black screen--regardless of what he does.
[05:32] <logi> how's that?
[05:32] <PatrickDickey> !unetbootin | logi this is what I use to make bootable USB Drives
[05:32] <ubottu> logi this is what I use to make bootable USB Drives: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[05:33] <logi> it says, file could not be loaded... etc
[05:33] <orbitwhite> unetbootin also works fine
[05:33] <PatrickDickey> I think it might be a bad DVD burn, myself. Even the integrity check won't load up.
[05:33] <logi> does ubuntu have issues with AMD FM2's?
[05:34] <orbitwhite> i heard something about amd issues with windows
[05:34] <orbitwhite> windows issues with amd*
[05:34] <logi> btw patrick thank you :D
[05:34] <logi> what about ubuntu?
[05:35] <orbitwhite> everything should be great when it comes to basic components support such as cpu
[05:35] <PatrickDickey> logi, you could always try 12.04 and get it installed. Then upgrade to 12.10 from there.
[05:35] <orbitwhite> especially cpus and memory
[05:35] <logi> ok maybe i could download another one
[05:35] <logi> thanks :D
[05:36] <PatrickDickey> No problem. Like I said before, burn it at whatever the slowest speed possible is.
[05:36] <orbitwhite> there is something wrong with installation process or media u install from
[05:36] <orbitwhite> consider some "unetbootin" as an option
[05:36] <logi> i think my installer is corrupted or something
[05:37] <Brombomb> gotta love using a 55" TV as a monitor
[05:37] <orbitwhite> logi, http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
[05:37] <logi> hey guys. what do you think about the LTS?
[05:37] <logi> that's the one I used :D
[05:37] <orbitwhite> lts is for long term support
[05:37] <logi> thanks orbit
[05:38] <logi> what about that?
[05:38] <PatrickDickey> That's what I'm recommending you try.
[05:38] <logi> oh i see
[05:38] <PatrickDickey> 12.04 is the LTS, and then 14.04 will be the next one.
[05:38] <logi> oh ok.
[05:39] <logi> actually this is my first time to use open source os thats why i have many questions
[05:39] <PatrickDickey> logi: Personally, I'd stay on it for a bit also. At least until you know everything's working right. Then you can always upgrade.
[05:39] <orbitwhite> logi, there would be much more later, don't worry about it
[05:40] <logi> yeah. everyone's moving to open source
[05:40]  * PatrickDickey has beeon on Ubuntu for a few years, and I still have questions--and problems.
[05:40] <logi> ok :D
[05:41] <orbitwhite> slackware was a good start for me, but laziness brought me to ubuntu
[05:42] <PatrickDickey> I've played with slackware a bit. Only for recompiling kernels.
[05:42] <logi> what's the difference of an alternate installer from the desktop?
[05:42] <Brombomb> dang it broke my system
[05:42] <orbitwhite> it includes much to play with u don't want actually as for me =)
[05:43] <PatrickDickey> It's just a different type of installer logi. You can try either one. The "desktop" gives you a chance to try it before you buy it, so to speak. With the alternate, you're installing it.
[05:43] <PatrickDickey> Brombomb: what broke your system?
[05:43] <logi> what do you recommend?
[05:43] <Brombomb> system disk check "Fix itself"
[05:43] <zebaszp> go
[05:43] <PatrickDickey> logi: Try the desktop one first. Then install from there. If that doesn't work, then get the alternate.
[05:44] <logi> it can always be dual booted with windows right?
[05:44] <PatrickDickey> logi: Yep. That's what a lot of people start out with. It will handle everything for you.
[05:44] <zebaszp> it's
[05:44] <logi> ok thanks.
[05:44] <orbitwhite> Brombomb, sometimes when something goes bad with hdd, fsck finishes it to the end
[05:45] <PatrickDickey> logi: You'll get to a screen that says something like "Ubuntu has detected another operating system." Choose the option to install alongside Windows.
[05:45] <logi> ok thanks
[05:45] <orbitwhite> PatrickDickey, won't it install on ntfs this way?
[05:46] <zebaszp> orbitwhite,
[05:46] <orbitwhite> i mean on mapped ntfs partition as squashfs image or something
[05:46] <PatrickDickey> orbitwhite: no, it will repartition the space, and make that ext4, I think. I've always created my partitions first, but I don't think we want to go there tonight. ;-)

[06:11] <Sylphie> zebaszp \ sounds like you need a new dvi>vga convertor, if you've got a vga monitor
[06:11] <zebaszp> I did mention it, but I can paste it again
[06:12] <zebaszp> I don't want a new adapter, the video card has a native VGA port which works fine on Windows but Ubuntu doesn't recognize it, which is why I'm trapped in this little hell
[06:13] <zebaszp> It used to work just fine before
[06:13] <PatrickDickey> zebaszp: Is it a nvidia or ati card?
[06:13] <zebaszp> nvidia g210
[06:13] <dr_willis> IF he says S3 im running.. ;)
[06:13]  * PatrickDickey has an S3 somewhere in a box.... Waiting for Spring cleaning.
[06:14] <Sylphie> zebaszp \ if you boot the install disc, does the video work?
[06:14] <dr_willis> Id be curious if older ubuntu's or other disrtos properly see the vga port and work.
[06:14]  * orbitwhite suggest to send a gift with s3 to dr_willis 
[06:14] <orbitwhite> s*
[06:14] <zebaszp> oh god, I hadn't thought of that, how silly of me :P
[06:14] <zebaszp> my guess would be yes, since it worked before
[06:14] <PatrickDickey> I can say that Ubuntu 12.04 sees VGA ports and works. I've used it on my mythbuntu box. Up until about a month ago.
[06:15] <zebaszp> there must be some X.org misconfiguration or something
[06:15] <dr_willis> Try a 12.04 live cd - and see if it still works.. could be somthing  weird going on.

[06:16] <Sylphie> does the nvidia driver even have a confguration item for which output to use?
[06:16] <BONG_IT> i cant find my installation of software
[06:17] <PatrickDickey> logi: I won't try it for another couple of weeks or so. And I'll only try it, because I'm on the Ubuntu Manual project, and we are going to release a version for it.
[06:17] <BONG_IT> where i can find my softwares installation
[06:17] <PatrickDickey> which software did you install, and how?
[06:18] <zebaszp> I used the little adapter (which now displays everything in an eye-straining purple tone), but the nvidia config tool shows only one port: the current monitor

[06:22] <Sylphie> zebaszp \ if th nvidia util sees only one output, then X isn't going to see more than one, so it's unlikely your problem is a misconfiguration

[06:32] <nytrix> im a regular user on my machine, how do i wsitch to admin in terminal to install something? is it su username?
[06:32] <Brombomb> using the gmediarenderer
[06:32] <PatrickDickey> now for the slightly more serious answer mfilipe. It creates the partitions that you need/request. As for aligning them, I'm not sure what you mean. It creates and sets the proper flags, and creates a bootloader to boot them.
[06:33] <PatrickDickey> nytrix: You'll use sudo and your login password. su - is not recommended with ubuntu.
[06:33] <orbitwhite> i always use su and `sudo su` but im retarded
[06:33] <nytrix> i use sudo but doesnt ask for admin password
[06:34] <PatrickDickey> it should ask for your password.
[06:34] <nytrix> just asks for regular usr passwd
[06:34] <mfilipe> I'm going to install Ubuntu on my new laptop which uses SSD. I read that ssd align is very important for better performance. So, I wanna now if the Ubuntu installer calculates the ssd align automagically.
[06:34] <PatrickDickey> nytrix: that's because you're the admin.
[06:34] <nytrix> nytrix is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
[06:34] <orbitwhite> mfilipe, not that really matters actually
[06:34] <PatrickDickey> nytrix: Are you the only user on the computer?
[06:35] <nytrix> no
[06:35] <mfilipe> orbitwhite, really? why?
[06:35] <PatrickDickey> nytrix: Do you know the login information for the other user?
[06:35] <orbitwhite> mfilipe, because i didn't mentioned anything wrong
[06:35] <nytrix> and i dont want to keep logging in and out everytime
[06:35] <nytrix> yes
[06:35] <Sylphie> nytrix \ interpol is unlikely to come visit you
=== Guest16048 is now known as Finklepants
[06:36] <PatrickDickey> nytrix then you can use su - username. it's just not recommended. The question that I have is, why don't you set yourself as an admin?
[06:36] <nytrix> so i have to log in and back in as admin to perform admin commands in terminal?
[06:36] <orbitwhite> mfilipe, correct options for operating with ssd storage media really do matter, but there r tons of howtos on google about it

[06:39] <devvrat_> belive me
[06:40] <xx4h> devvrat_, what is slow.
[06:40] <PatrickDickey> devvrat_: what graphics card do you have installed?
[06:40] <devvrat_> opening the application moving scoller etc
[06:40]  * PatrickDickey had that issue with an older ATI card, and the open source drivers.
[06:40] <devvrat_> ati card
[06:40] <xx4h> devvrat_, maybe you have to install gpu-driver?
[06:40] <PatrickDickey> Which ati card, devvrat_
[06:41] <devvrat_> dont know
[06:42] <devvrat_> i have tryed many driver but dosent work
[06:42] <Brombomb> bad idea adding the pulse user to the root group?
[06:42] <PatrickDickey> devvrat_: Open a terminal window (CTRL+Alt+T) and type lspci | grep VGA in. Tell us what it says
[06:43] <PatrickDickey> devvrat_: you can copy and paste that, to make it easier.
[06:43] <orbitwhite> Brombomb, adding users to root group is always not a perfect solution talking of security
[06:43] <Finklepants> i tryed all of that nosence already, i know this was i know bug or something but cant find if its fixed. it worked great in 11 but went to 12 and wifi keeps hanging up
[06:44] <devvrat_> ATI RC410 (radeon xpress 200M)
[06:45] <orbitwhite> Finklepants, not a very good idea but often latest compat-wireless helps to solve something related to stable work
[06:46] <Finklepants> does that have chance of breaking wifi completely?
[06:47] <orbitwhite> define breaking
[06:47] <Sylphie> Finklepants \ I have seen linux wreck hardware before. Life is full of risks
[06:48] <Finklepants> k given it a shot
[06:48] <orbitwhite> http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/ath9k
=== sha is now known as Guest16547
[06:50] <PatrickDickey> devvrat_: That's an old card. Ubuntu may not support it anymore, as ATI doesn't necessarily support it now.
[06:51] <PatrickDickey> devvrat_: If Ubuntu does support it, it'll be with Unity 2D at the most, and they're phasing that out. You *might* be able to use something like lubuntu or xubuntu though.
[06:51] <orbitwhite> or get mate
[06:52] <PatrickDickey> devvrat_: http://askubuntu.com/questions/215181/no-unity-after-ubuntu-12-10-upgrade might help out though. I used it with my card, for a bit. But I have a newer "old" card.
[06:53] <devvrat_> okk thanks for help
[06:53] <PatrickDickey> No problem. Sorry that I can't be more helpful.
[06:53] <devvrat_> no pro.
[06:56] <cellofellow> My dash and hud, alt tab, most of unity really, has been really quite dragging lately. Is there a way to clean it up, remove crufty stuff in there somewhere so it will speed back up?
[06:57] <PatrickDickey> cellofellow: it sounds like you're having the graphics card issues too. Which card do you have?
[06:57] <cellofellow> PatrickDickey: HD 4000
[06:58] <cellofellow> Intel
[06:58] <miroesq> I was told that I should never log in as root , but rather log in as a normal user and use sudo. Does that mean I should not enable the root account to begin with as well?
[06:58] <PatrickDickey> Intel or ATI Radeon?
[06:58] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: you shouldn't need to enable the root account at all. In fact, it isn't enabled in a default installation.
[06:59] <cellofellow> miroesq: yes, don't enable root, you can do everything root can do without running user programs by using sudo.
[06:59] <cellofellow> s/user programs/user programs as root/
[06:59] <cellofellow> PatrickDickey: Intel HD 4000
[07:00] <miroesq> i was really using root so i can log in with ssh and move files around, change permissions. it was just easier for me to use than linux
[07:00] <cellofellow> miroesq: sudo -s
[07:00] <PatrickDickey> cellofellow: Not sure then. You could check the forums to see if anyone has issues with that card.
[07:00] <miroesq> cellofellow: my ssh is a GUI. I use winscp
[07:01] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: what cellofellow said. Or just sudo works too. You log in with the user account, and just sudo comand.
[07:01] <hagzag_> Hi, I have question regarding apt-get urls behind explicit proxy is this the right place ?
[07:02] <PatrickDickey> hagzag_: what's the question. We might be able to answer it.
[07:02] <cellofellow> miroesq: if you are scping only then root account, while still unadviseable, is less of a problem than if you intend to log in a full desktop session.
[07:02] <zebaszp> hello there!
[07:02] <PatrickDickey> wb zebaszp. Did everything work out?
[07:03] <miroesq> cellofellow: how do i disable the root account then or should i just leave it as is and not log in with it?
[07:03] <zebaszp> I ended up uninstalling the nvidia driver from a tty
[07:03] <zebaszp> sure enough, the desktop's back
[07:03] <zebaszp> and my goodness, galluim drivers work a lot better than I recalled
[07:03] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: how did you enable the root account?
[07:04] <cellofellow> miroesq: probably best way to disable root account is sudo passwd root --delete
[07:04] <_dmn> How to change a file which needs root permission using the GUI?
[07:04] <hagzag_> I see your discussing Nvidia I have thinkPad W520, and I havent yet found a way to configure it [tried a ton of howtos]
[07:04] <hagzag_> _dmn = use "gksudo nautilus"
[07:04] <miroesq> cellofellow: I created a password then i enabled the account
[07:04] <miroesq> sudo passwd root
[07:04] <miroesq> sudo passwd –u root
[07:05] <cellofellow> miroesq: yeah, just use the --delete option on passwd
[07:05] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: sudo passwd -dl root will disable the root account.
[07:05] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[07:05] <miroesq> thank you very much guys
[07:05] <zebaszp> I've backed up and deleted xorg.conf, and purged the nvidia packages, I'll reboot and try to install them back
[07:05] <zebaszp> brb
[07:06] <cellofellow> I've been using gnome-shell on my computer at work, which is I'll admit a much faster machine than this (this is an i5 with 4GB ram, the other is a Phenom 8 core with 32GB ram) but it really shouldn't be this much slower with Unity.
[07:06] <hagzag_> apt-get urls behind explicit proxy anyone ?
[07:07] <_dmn> hagzag_: Thanks a lot, it worked.:)
[07:07] <hagzag_> _dmn: np, enjoy
[07:09] <PatrickDickey> hagzag_: you're behind a proxy, and want to get to apt-get right?
[07:10] <hagzag_> yes, but I nned to provide a list of url's to our GSO Dept so they will add the urls
[07:10] <hagzag_> the apt-get configuration part of the proxy should be simple :)
[07:11] <hagzag_> the big Q with all the mirrors which url's should I be enabeling
[07:11] <PatrickDickey> hagzag_: will they take domains, or do you need the exact urls?
[07:11] <hagzag_> I can try domains and see if it flys :)
[07:11] <PatrickDickey> If they'll take entire domains, then it's ubuntu.com. Otherwise it's archives.ubuntu.com security.ubuntu.com and a few more. I'd have to do an update to figure it out.
[07:12] <hagzag_> so what you mean is add *.ubuntu.com should suffice ?
[07:12] <PatrickDickey> Yep. That should work.
[07:12] <hagzag_> thanks wil try that then
[07:14] <miroesq> PatrickDickey: what about when executing a script, I should be logged in as root then, correct?
[07:14] <mvt007geek> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[07:14] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: nope. you'll use sudo if it requires root access.
[07:14] <zebaszp> while I wait for the nvidia package to download, I had a little question that's been bugging me for some while
[07:15] <PatrickDickey> hagzag_: here's my list of archives. YMMV though. what you could do, is try apt-get update, and copy the list of sites.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/1533629/
[07:15] <miroesq> PatrickDickey: yes, but the password is only good for 15 minutes, i ran an install script that lasted for about an hour
[07:16] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: It'll prompt you whenver a command requires the password. Or it should. If not, then you can change the commands inside of the script to include sudo.
[07:16] <zebaszp> Deja Dup gives me a "/usr/bin/duplicity" error ever since the 2nd backup (I configured it with Ubuntu One)
[07:16] <PatrickDickey> and miroesq what script are you running, if you don't mind my asking.
[07:16] <miroesq> freeswitch and fusionpbx
[07:17] <miroesq> PatrickDickey: is there a way to increase the amount of time from 15 to 2 hours or so?
[07:17] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: not that I'm aware of. I've never tried though.
[07:18] <miroesq> PatrickDickey: i will not be able to change anything in the script as i am so not technical enough, so i think i will enable the root and disable it once i am done with any script installs
[07:18] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: does the script ask you for sudo password at all?
[07:19] <miroesq> don't know. i had installed it using root :)
[07:20] <zebaszp> YES! YES!
[07:20] <zebaszp> finally! my desktop, back to it's full glory!
[07:20] <PatrickDickey> miroesq: It should either prompt you, or tell you that you need to run sudo. And I think it will keep that script running as root while it's going.
[07:20] <PatrickDickey> zebaszp: Glad to hear it. :D
[07:20] <zebaszp> admitedly, I'm using one of the repo drivers instead of the xorg-edgers one, but still
[07:21] <zebaszp> thanks a lot for your support, you are all amazing people
[07:21] <PatrickDickey> Glad to help. :)
[07:21] <zebaszp> I wish I could contribute to the community in more meaningful ways, but I'll just keep promoting Ubuntu for the time being
[07:22] <PatrickDickey> zebaszp: I'm sure you can contribute. Everything you've learned here, will help someone else.
[07:23]  * PatrickDickey breaks his computer on a regular basis....  And learns from it.
[07:23] <zebaszp> I'll drop by the IRC more often, I'd never actually used it before, it's great
[07:23] <zebaszp> Trial and error. Mostly error.
[07:24] <PatrickDickey> Yep it is. I got hooked on it (irc) back in the days of MSN chats. I used to run a room there.
[07:24] <miroesq> PatrickDickey: i just looked at the script and i did execute everything having to do with it using sudo. so what does that mean?
[07:24] <zebaszp> I'll just listen to the Jonoboard for a while, just to celebrate how awesome communities are (ours and in general)
[07:25] <PatrickDickey> It means that you probably didn't need to be root, miroesq.
[07:25] <miroesq> PatrickDickey: mind you, i am not talking about what is inside the script as i don't know that. i am just talking about chmoding, moving and running it
[07:25] <Shazer[2]> Hey guys
[07:25] <Shazer[2]> I'm just wondering how I go about making sure everything I install on Ubuntu goes to another HDD
[07:25] <Shazer[2]> Not my SSD
[07:25] <Shazer[2]> Like it did last time
[07:26] <PatrickDickey> Shazer[2]: when you get into the Installation, it should prompt you for where you want to install everything. If not, I'd use an alternate installation disc. Choose the "Something else" or "manually partition" option.
[07:27] <Shazer[2]> PatrickDickey: I'm already installed now :/
[07:27] <Shazer[2]> Is there a way to do it now?
[07:28] <PatrickDickey> What all do you want to move? everything, and not use the SSD at all, or just things like your /home directory?
[07:29] <zebaszp> I seem to be missing one resolution, any idea how to add it back? I'm looking at the wiki, but so far nothing
[07:30] <PatrickDickey> zebaszp: I'm not sure. If it's not in the wiki, then I don't really know. They may not know that it works.
[07:31] <PatrickDickey> Shazer[2]: http://askubuntu.com/questions/106527/how-to-move-ubuntu-installation-from-one-hdd-to-another or maybe http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1598869
[07:31] <Brombomb> woohoo!  sweet sweet music
[07:31] <PatrickDickey> Glad to hear it Brombomb.
[07:31] <mladoux> @zebaszp you could try this --> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Use_cvt.2BAC8-xrandr_tool_to_add_the_highest_mode_the_LCD_can_do
[07:32] <Brombomb> I used that gstreamrenderer and the trick was unmuting my sound cards heaphone channel
[07:32] <PatrickDickey> Cool :D it's usually the simple things.
[07:32] <zebaszp> I was looking at that :P
[07:32] <Brombomb> so it serves the library content to my phone, which then acts remote to send commands back to the same server instructing it what to play.
[07:33] <logi> patrick
[07:33] <mladoux> zebaszp, yeah, that works in most cases, but I've personally run into one or two where it does not.
[07:33] <PatrickDickey> logi, how's it going?
[07:34] <Brombomb> now to download the Ubuntuphone source and load that up...
[07:34] <mladoux> that's when you need to dig and hope that monitor specs are published with all the right bits and pieces. They almost never are.
[07:34] <x-os_pal> hey all! just installed bodhi to use strickly for studies..i'm comming from arch and i just need someone to explain how the whole root account works here on ubuntu. i heard something about auto-generated root passwords for securty and i just want to do some work as straight root. any links are appreciated.
[07:34] <cobra-the-joker> Hey there every one ... how can i install cpanel on ubuntu 12.10 ?
[07:34] <PatrickDickey> x-os_pal: you don't normally use root, you use sudo
[07:34] <PatrickDickey> !sudo | x-os_pal
[07:34] <ubottu> x-os_pal: sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[07:34] <mladoux> x-os_pal, sudo -i will give you a root shell
[07:35] <logi> i got 16x lowest writing speed
[07:35] <logi> is that ok?
[07:35] <PatrickDickey> logi: if that's the lowest speed your drive shows (smallest number) then yes.
[07:35] <Shazer[2]> PatrickDickey: sorry
[07:35] <Shazer[2]> My computer died
[07:35] <Shazer[2]> What did you say was an alternative?
[07:36] <Theodore> hello
[07:36] <x-os_pal> thanks for the quick replies ubottu and mladoux...i understand that but i want full access to root as root. it's definately possible because i doubt system admins use sudo for everything...
[07:36] <PatrickDickey> Shazer[2]: no worries, Mine dies every day. :) I'll scroll up and get the reply for you.
[07:36] <Theodore> is ubuntu for android a cell os or a operating system for cells?
[07:36] <Shazer[2]> Thanks PatrickDickey :)

[07:36] <cobra-the-joker> Cpanel on ubuntu ...any one ?
[07:37] <mvt007geek> can someone tell me what sh -c 'zcat ./ubuntu-11.10-preinstalled-desktop-armel+omap4.img.gz | dd bs=4M of=/dev/sdb
[07:37] <mvt007geek>   do exactly?
[07:37] <somsip> !phone | Theodore
[07:37] <ubottu> Theodore: Ubuntu for phone has been announced, see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone to find out more and to sign up for progress updates. Discussion is in #ubuntu-phone
[07:37] <PatrickDickey> x-os_pal: The first link that ubottu gave you talks about enabling the root account.
[07:37] <Shazer[2]> Hmm
[07:37] <DWSR> I assume that http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/200712-180/ would imply that the 2950 works with any LATER versions of Ubuntu?
[07:37] <Shazer[2]> I want to install Ubuntu on SSD but everything that gets installed like Chrome or anything I install on Ubuntu goes on HDD
[07:37] <mladoux> sudo -i will give you a full root shell. Root is locked off in ubuntu by default, so sudo is the only way to access it. It's the same as using su
[07:38] <logi> what is the another application you can use for burning ISO's?
[07:38] <mvt007geek> can someone tell me what sh -c 'zcat ./ubuntu-11.10-preinstalled-desktop-armel+omap4.img.gz | dd bs=4M of=/dev/sdb do exactly? i want to install it on sd card to use on pandaboard
[07:38] <PatrickDickey> Shazer[2]: if you just did the installation, I'd say reinstall.  Put / on the SSD, and /var/usr/home on the other drive. You'll have to create partitions for each though.
[07:38] <mladoux> the -i stands for interactive.
[07:38] <x-os_pal> thanks all!
[07:39] <PatrickDickey> mvt007geek: you can google zcat, and find out from there.
[07:39] <zebaszp> the voice of Jono saying "community" is surprisingly addictive
[07:39] <mladoux> well, i guess you could do it with an ssl key login, but yeah
[07:39] <logi> application that can burn ISO?? SOMEBODY??
[07:39] <PatrickDickey> cobra-the-joker: did you download cpanel or are you at the starting point (just wanting to do it)?
[07:40] <zebaszp> logi: Brasero comes preinstalled, I think
[07:40] <somsip> logi: brasero, xfburn
[07:40] <mladoux> logi -- brasero is the standard for that, but xfburn is a good alternative
[07:40] <mvt007geek> PatrickDickey: i wabt to know the difference between that and this command: gunzip -c ubunut_omap4_image_file.img.gz | sudo dd bs=4M of=/dev/sdb
[07:40] <PatrickDickey> cobra-the-joker: http://forums.cpanel.net/f34/installing-cpanel-ubuntu-server-67159.html
[07:40] <logi> ok :D
[07:40] <mvt007geek> PatrickDickey: want to know which one is better to use?
[07:40] <cobra-the-joker> PatrickDickey: i downloaded from the usual wget method ... but then it say that it is not supported
[07:41] <cobra-the-joker> so no cpanel for ubuntu ?
[07:41] <PatrickDickey> cobra-the-joker: look at the link I just gave you http://forums.cpanel.net/f34/installing-cpanel-ubuntu-server-67159.html it might help.
[07:41] <cobra-the-joker> it says that you cant install it there :D
[07:43] <Thor> cobra-the-joker: http://forums.cpanel.net/f145/debian-support-ubuntu-server-lts-support-153517.html is also useful here
[07:43] <PatrickDickey> mvt007geek: I'm not sure which is better. I'd say you could ask in a #perl room though. Assuming it's a perl file that you're working with.
[07:43] <mvt007geek> perl?
[07:43] <PatrickDickey> It's a scripting language.
[07:43] <Thor> cobra-the-joker: Cpanel used to support debian, but not anymore.

[07:47] <zebaszp> not even close :P Argentina
[07:47] <mvt007geek> here is 11 am :)
[07:48] <Thor> PatrickDickey: france would be 8:47 am ;P
[07:48] <PatrickDickey> Wow. I didn't realize that you were that far East. I'm in the middle of the US.

[07:48]  * PatrickDickey needs to change his wallpaper to the CIRAF map. :P
[07:48] <PatrickDickey> Cold. LOL
[07:48] <zebaszp> "that far east"? it's UTC -3
[07:49] <PatrickDickey> Right, I'm UTC -6 or 5 depending on the time of year.
[07:49] <Thor> zebaszp: I thought argentina was more east than that O.o

[07:51] <zebaszp> I have no idea what I'm looking at, besides "a map" :P
[07:51] <Thor> lol
[07:52] <zebaszp> what is CIRAF?
[07:52] <PatrickDickey> It's for Shortwave Radio Signals. You find your number (or numbers around your area), and look in shortwave radio schedules to find out when they're transmitting to you.
[07:52] <Thor> http://www.jgiesen.de/astro/astroJS/timezone/index.htm is more useful

[07:53] <zebaszp> Thor, yeah, I know, but I don't really give a damn as long as nights are dark and days are bright :P
[07:53] <PatrickDickey> lol No worries zebaszp. The only reason I know, is because I have an ancient (like made in 1942) shortwave radio. Along with a couple of new ones.
[07:53] <Thor> :)
[07:54] <Thor> zebaszp: timezones never make sense other than that night look dark :P
[07:54] <PatrickDickey> alimj: It might be apt-cache, but I'm not sure. Or dpkg. I know you can search in apt-cache for programs.
[07:55] <zebaszp> I know, but I couldn't care less about a 1-hour difference :P
[07:55] <alimj> PatrickDickey: I use apt-cache for searching available packages; however, I do not believe that it chould be apt-cache
[07:55] <alimj> PatrickDickey: I would like to install this software on another platform

[08:15] <delfries> would it be an issue though?
[08:15] <MonkeyDust> Theodore  #ubuntu+1 for 13.04
[08:15] <Theodore> yeah its the beta night build
[08:15] <Theodore> the raring version
[08:16] <delfries> well thats fine. i'm asking if there would be issues in putting 12.04 on a disk and installing over 12.10
[08:16] <Theodore> no i would do a full format
[08:16] <Theodore> or install to its own partition or a 2nd partition on the same drive
[08:16] <Theodore> :)
[08:17] <amagee> hey, i'm trying to get dual monitors working on ubuntu 12.04, and now i'm using an intel graphics card
[08:17] <delfries> how do i do a ful format?
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[08:17] <amagee> the "displays" widget only finds one screen
[08:17] <amagee> as does xrandr
[08:18] <Theodore> when you load the disc
[08:18] <MonkeyDust> delfries  use gparted on a live cd, delete the partition
[08:18] <Theodore> say format over entire capacity of drive
[08:18] <Theodore> don't use partitioning
[08:18] <delfries> ok that will work i think

[08:38] <daftykins> Eagleman: if they don't support it, there's no way around it.
[08:39] <daftykins> Eagleman: however if you had a gmail account, you could have that check the POP account and automatically store those emails with a given label so you don't have to worry about using a desktop client
[08:39] <Eagleman> daftykins, there is no way setting up a mail system to recieve pop3 and then retrieve the stored pop3 messages with imap
[08:40] <daftykins> Eagleman: IMAP is a protocol that needs to be supported on the mail server.
[08:40] <daftykins> Eagleman: you could create your own mail server, but that'd just complicate matters.

[09:02] <circle> May as well ask here. I'm planning a format/reinstall; I have two HDDs, and I want to dual boot Linux and Windows. What do you guys think would be the best partition setup?
[09:02] <circle> I was thinking HDD 1  is just pure windows (320GB). Second HDD I use for Linux, with a parition for /home, /boot, a swap, and a storage.
[09:03] <MonkeyDust> circle  start here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PartitioningSchemes
[09:03] <zigovr> hi all, I have an encrypted partition (/dev/sda7), I added it to my cryptab file
[09:03] <circle> MonkeyDust: I'll check it out
[09:03] <zigovr> however at boot it is not automatically opened, I need to type "M" and then open it (cryptsetup luksOpen) manually
[09:04] <zigovr> I did run update-initramfs several times already
[09:04] <ActionParsnip> circle: hdd1:  Windows sytem and 20Gb for Ubuntu system and 30Gb for /home. Hdd2: partition for windows page file and windows %temp%, partition for swap space, rest for user docs
[09:05] <circle> ActionParsnip: interesting
[09:06] <ActionParsnip> circle: swap and windows pagefile / temp on a different drive gives a speed boost, keeping user docs in its own partition eases backups
[09:06] <ActionParsnip> circle: having a small partition for /home and then symlinking the folders to the other partition will make the access transparent too
[09:07] <zigovr> ok problem solved, my file was called cryptab instead of crypttab -_-
[09:07] <circle> ActionParsnip: that seems quite complex, but I will consider ity
[09:07] <ActionParsnip> circle: its how i'd do it.
[09:08] <ActionParsnip> circle: if the data partition is NTFS then both OSes can use the same data asd the Windows OS is unable to access Ext4

[10:05] <jaker3333> ActionParsnip:  i have 11.04 and i want it to be 10 yrs at least before i upgrade
[10:05] <gatuus> do ou know if it is really necessary to put the "ubuntu" user when creating a custom image of ubuntu with cloud-init?
[10:05] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: there will be holes discovered in it later and you will be vulnerable. Why not clean install with Precise
[10:05] <gatuus> "do you.."
[10:06] <mokush> ActionParsnip: I just restarted the ssh service. should I also log-out and try again?
[10:06] <jaker3333> ActionParsnip:  took me month to make it do what i want
[10:06] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: don't you think Wikipedia get attacks, on a daily basis?
[10:06] <jaker3333> months*
[10:06] <jaker3333> i use windows XP on another PC. never bothered to update it
[10:06] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: then it was probably EOL before you even started
[10:06] <jaker3333> an OS released on 2001
[10:06] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: XP is still supported, its being phased out now (early stages)
[10:07] <daftykins> april 2014 XP finally dies
[10:07] <daftykins> \o/
[10:07] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: using natty you will get no updates and no suport here or any of the other official channels. You will simply be told to upgrade
[10:07] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: I'd say it depends on a lot of factors. But, at some point, they won't make updates for the version anymore. So, when you run into problems, you won't be able to get current help.
[10:07] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: the OS will run but the security holes in the packages will never get fixed
[10:08] <jaker3333> PatrickDickey:  will i be able to use latest brower in like 5 yrs ?
[10:08] <jaker3333> or it won't work on my 11.04?
[10:08]  * PatrickDickey knows of a company whos kiosks are still running Hardy Heron
[10:08] <Theodore> hi
[10:08] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: you may be able to use the archived versions of browsers but they may fail to run as they will expect certain versions of libs in the OS
[10:08] <jaker3333> all i care about it browing the net on linux
[10:08] <Theodore> how are you all tonight?
[10:08] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: how does it take months, just to get web access?
[10:09] <jaker3333> once i used Internet explorer to view a file and the server launched an pplications from my temporarly folder to hack my pc
[10:09] <ActionParsnip> Theodore: 10am here, otherwise ok ;)
[10:09] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: I'd say it won't work. As distributions stop supporting the OS, so will browser makers. Heck, Google won't allow you to connect with older versions of Internet Explorer anymore.
[10:09] <jaker3333> it disabled all the programs and alit ctrl delete.. told me to press the OKay button on the screen to continue
[10:09] <daftykins> :D
[10:09] <jaker3333> i forced shut down and logged to another account and scanned teh pc
[10:09] <jaker3333> it found the virus in ie temp folder
[10:10] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: how does it take months to configure a PC if you only need web access?
[10:10] <jaker3333> ActionParsnip:  cuz i'm not smart as you
[10:10] <jaker3333> i take ti step by step
[10:10] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: the newer packages and kernel may make things work out of the box
[10:10] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: By configure, are you saying lock down all non-essential services, or do you mean just getting your stuff the way you want?
[10:11] <Theodore> ActionParsnip, im doing good too
[10:11] <jaker3333> PatrickDickey:  yes i make it as light as i can and i block everhing on the network except 1 port
[10:11] <Theodore> ActionParsnip, its 2:11AM here in southern california
[10:11] <jaker3333> i customize the browser too
[10:11] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: you can backup the config folder for the browser and restore it in the new OS
[10:11] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: Some of that will remain, if you upgrade. And if not, you should be able to fix everything back up again pretty quickly.
[10:12] <jaker3333> i only run two things.. wine and a browser on it
[10:12] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: wine is fun, what do you use?
[10:12] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: why wine?
[10:12] <jaker3333> to run 1 windows program
[10:12] <jaker3333> one
[10:12] <jaker3333> browser is native
[10:12] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: which one, if you don't mind my asking?
[10:13] <jaker3333> na. it's a secert
[10:13] <jaker3333> also that program runs best on wine 1.3
[10:13] <jaker3333> the GUI breaks on 1.5
[10:13] <jaker3333> so my luck
[10:14] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: no worries. Wine will still work. And you can install wine 1.3 on newer versions. You might have to do it manually, but you should be able to do it.
[10:14] <jaker3333> ok
[10:14] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: Does it work on 1.4.1? (wine)
[10:14] <jaker3333> i tried but the GUI is missing some edges
[10:15] <jaker3333> anyway.. i'm extremely happy with 11.04
[10:15] <jaker3333> never gave me a problem
[10:15] <PatrickDickey> edges, as in the window is too big, or something else? And more to the point, have you filed a bug with the wine developers about it?
[10:15] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: i recommend a clean install of Precise. If you must hold on to Natty then wait til April next year and install 14.04 (LTS also)
[10:15] <jaker3333> 120MB without page file at start up
[10:15] <jaker3333> better than XP or even win98
[10:15] <jaker3333> total RAM is 2GB
[10:17] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: You're preaching to the choir here. I'm running a DVR on an old Dell computer (like 2001 built). And an Amahi Home Server on a computer I built in 2003.
[10:17] <jaker3333> also the best part is faking your browser user agent on the net
[10:17] <jaker3333> it's showing win5.1 i think .. it means XP
[10:17] <jaker3333> so i someone trying to attack your broswer it won't work on linux
[10:17] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: i cant think of a modern browser that can't do that....
[10:17] <jaker3333> if*
[10:18] <jaker3333> ActionParsnip:  yeah i know but i meant like what they did on my xp os by hacking me through IE
[10:18] <jaker3333> .exe won't work on linux
[10:18] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: it will but it will only affect ~/.wine :)
[10:18] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: Yes it will.  Sort of.. You have wine installed. So, in theory it will run.
[10:19] <jaker3333> yeah but when i double click on it it says it can not open the file
[10:19] <jaker3333> must right lick on and chooose run on wine
[10:19] <jaker3333> so it won't
[10:20] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: the exploits in the app will affect your ~/.wine folder. You don't necessarily have to double click it
[10:21] <jaker3333> anyway ActionParsnip  i will keep it for at least 5 yrs
[10:21] <jaker3333> thanks for the advice
[10:21] <jaker3333> if nothing get hacked i will add another 5 yrs
[10:21] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: your call but there will be zero support here and zero updates to packages
[10:21] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: if you just need web acces, you could try xpud
[10:22] <jaker3333> what is xpud ?
[10:22] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: go find out
[10:22] <jaker3333> ubuntu loads apps x2 faster than windows
[10:22] <jaker3333> very light on RAM
[10:22] <jaker3333> and very low on CPU load

[10:23] <sevenhill> jaker3333,  open isn't mean free always
[10:23] <PatrickDickey> jaker3333: And, in truth, if you're that worried about security, you could use something like TOR (the Onion Router).
[10:24] <ActionParsnip> jaker3333: its been that way for a long long time
[10:24] <llutz> PatrickDickey: how is TOR security related?
[10:26] <PatrickDickey> llutz: In the sense that it hides your IP address for one. I may have misspoke on how well it's related though.
[10:28] <ponzellus> llutz: and your traffic gets encrypted, at least from your pc to the (trusty?!) node ;)
[10:28] <llutz> ponzellus: it doesn't
[10:30] <ponzellus> llutz: that's what this page says, though https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en

[10:52] <luckymurali> how can i set it right
[10:53] <luckymurali> im using ubuntu 11.04
[10:53] <PatrickDickey> VP1: You have to go to Windows to change file permissions on a NTFS drive. Or format it into a POSIX - friendly filesystem.
[10:53] <ActionParsnip> luckymurali: natty is eol, no longer supported

[11:19] <codephobic> hi
[11:20] <codephobic> I'm not sure whether this is an ubuntu problem or an issue with my ReadyNas Duo, but several mp3 folders I moved onto my NAS are now missing tracks.
[11:21] <codephobic> All in all, maybe 4-5hrs of CD rip sessions worth of tracks
[11:21] <codephobic> is there a known problem with transferring large amounts of files from a desktop to a Nas using Ubuntu?
[11:23] <codephobic> Also, is there anyway I can find out if files have been recently deleted accidentally (or maybe as a result of a crashed file transfer session with ubuntu)?
[11:24] <Space_Man> thanks somsip
[11:24] <blami> codephobic: I wouldn't recommend to move them using nautilus. Everytime I move a larger amount of files using nautilus something is missing
[11:25] <blami> codephobic: probably because of the fact the nautilus is designed by GNOME people who like to add ten or twenty layers of abstraction to everything to be sure there's enough space for code flaws and bugs
[11:25] <codephobic> blami, it seems I've been the victim of Nautilus.
[11:26] <codephobic> I've never really had a single major problem with linux, in all my dabblings.
[11:26] <blami> codephobic: anyway, I recommend to try just rsync it (if NAS supports that) or simply do cp in terminal. Also mc might work
[11:26] <codephobic> mc?
[11:26] <blami> codephobic: midnight commander ...
[11:27] <codephobic> I've never used that, I'm not that familiar with the utilities in ubuntu.
[11:27] <codephobic> hence my use of nautilus to transfer files, rather than using terminal
[11:27] <codephobic> I really didn't know how buggy it was
[11:27] <codephobic> very shocked
[11:28] <blami> codephobic: I had similar problem multiple times when I was copying something to CIFS/Samba volumes
[11:29] <codephobic> blami, sounds very much like my problem. I'm using cifs/samba shares on the NAS too
[11:29] <blami> codephobic: I think it's caused by some timeout which leads to server deleting the file but client sending next file after resume
[11:29] <codephobic> hmm, I'm really shocked and saddened by this. First time I've lost confidence in Linux.
[11:29] <blami> codephobic: when I mounted the volume manually using mount command from terminal and then copy files using bare cp command, everything worked well
[11:30] <codephobic> terminal works fast and smoothly, but sometimes it's easier - much easier - to select and place files in multiple category folders visually.
[11:30] <blami> codephobic: I know :)
[11:30] <codephobic> damn, should just have booted into windows...

[11:46] <codephobic> I'm actually very shocked - still shocked - by Nautilus' sabotage. First time ever, since I began using Ubuntu as my primary desktop, that I've had a problem that I didn't think was "acceptable".
[11:46] <ActionParsnip> codephobic: nautilus doesn't destroy data.

[11:47] <agsel> how do I reinstall unity on 12.04?
[11:47] <ActionParsnip> agsel: its default installed
[11:47] <agsel> or is there a repair option?
[11:47] <agsel> ActionParsnip: I know, but it's kind of screwed up
[11:47] <codephobic> ActionParsnip, it seems to have failed to transfer my files, whilst reporting to me otherwise... resulting in the data being lost.
[11:47] <ActionParsnip> agsel: sudo apt-get --reinstall install `dpkg -l | grep unity | awk {'print $2'}`
[11:48] <jrib> codephobic: did you file a bug about nautilus' crashes?
[11:48] <agsel> ActionParsnip: whatever configuration I try to set, it doesn't work. keyboard shortcuts, some compiz options etc
[11:48] <ActionParsnip> codephobic: then that sounds like the drive is faulty, nautilus just moves the data between the 2 places
[11:48] <codephobic> jrib, I didn't. I googled the issue and found bug reports covering my experience, so I left it at that and just tried to be more cautious.
[11:48] <arabi> http://pastie.org/5687748   all time I am getting the following error , while updating, installing all time :(
[11:48] <jrib> codephobic: which ones?
[11:49] <ActionParsnip> hariom: use TAB and ENTER to navigate the text UI
[11:49] <ActionParsnip> hariom: a URL will be generated, what is it please?
[11:49] <codephobic> ActionParsnip, I'm pretty confident that the Nas is ok. I use it every day and I run checks every other week (health checks on disks/raid).
[11:50] <ActionParsnip> arabi: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[11:50] <ActionParsnip> codephobic: i suggest you check the disk health.
[11:50] <codephobic> jrib, the issue regarding stalling/crashing when lots of files are being transferred and the issue with browsing directories with lots of files ... iirc, I saw them on launchpad
[11:50] <codephobic> ActionParsnip, I checked - one of the first things I did before coming here
[11:50] <arabi> ActionParsnip, Ubuntu 12.10 \n \l
[11:51] <MonkeyDust> codephobic  to trnasfer a lot/large files, better use rsync
[11:51] <codephobic> ActionParsnip, both disks are fine, I even used windows to transfer over my web files then checked them against what I was expecting.

[11:52] <codephobic> MonkeyDust, I didn't know that it was so risky.
[11:52] <arabi> ActionParsnip, I tried what is saying on that post
[11:52] <jrib> codephobic: I'm asking for a link or bug number; I don't know what you found
[11:53] <hariom> ActionParsnip: It didn't give url at the end. Simply says: Your ALSA information is located at
[11:53] <hariom> Please inform the person helping you.
[11:53] <arabi> but still not working... i also followed some stack overflow posts :( still no way
[11:54] <ActionParsnip> hariom: ok, remove the '--upload' bit  and run it, select to not upload, open the resultinmg file in gedit and pastebin that normally
[11:54] <codephobic> jrib, oh, well, I'll have to google them as I checked the issue a few months ago (I came in here and mentioned the problem too - but didn't think it that great, since the files did actually complete their transfer).
[11:54] <hariom> ActionParsnip: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2060996
[11:54] <jrib> codephobic: ok
[11:55] <ActionParsnip> hariom: oh, its a virtual pc?
[11:56] <ActionParsnip> hariom: are you running Ubuntu in virtualbox?
[11:56] <hariom> ActionParsnip: yea, but sound was working fine before
[11:56] <ActionParsnip> hariom: why did you not mention that at all?
[11:56] <hariom> ActionParsnip: Because I didn't think it could be problem. I have 5 VMs and they have audio perfectly running
[11:57] <ActionParsnip> hariom: its still detail about the setup, please give full details in future
[11:57] <ActionParsnip> hariom: try:   killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*    wait 10 seconds and reboot

[11:58] <ActionParsnip> hariom: all from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure   which I imagine you have been to..
[11:58] <codephobic> I was only transferring 1-2gb at a time
[11:58] <ActionParsnip> codephobic: try pcmanfm2
[11:59] <hariom> ActionParsnip: Is this ppa from backport? Why not standard lucid one
[11:59] <codephobic> ActionParsnip, is it fully compatible with Unity/Ubuntu?
[11:59] <MonkeyDust> codephobic  yes, it's in the repos
[12:00] <ActionParsnip> hariom: its a later version of alsa, Lucid has a painfully old Alsa version
[12:00] <codephobic> MonkeyDust, thanks.
[12:00] <ActionParsnip> codephobic: why would it not be. Of course
[12:00] <codephobic> ActionParsnip, I don't know, I guess after this I'm a bit wary of assuming things "hang together" properly.

=== jack is now known as Guest34182
[12:05] <codephobic> ActionParsnip, I never cared that it was slow, I figured it was still quite an ok product... I'm just a bit shaken out of my general (naive) view that things more or less work to a reliable standard in Ubuntu/Linux... Obviously I could have transferred things in a more laborious (command line) fashion, but given that it seemed to do the job ...
[12:06] <ActionParsnip> codephobic: it does, there are alternatives though. Could even use Rox etc :)
[12:07] <codephobic> ActionParsnip, I do like a lot of what it does, but losing files and misreporting transfers ... I don't think that's quite right.
[12:07] <jrib> codephobic: I think you should create a bug report (or find one more relevant).  I really don't see how the bug you linked is the same.  You should explain that nautilus somehow showed you that the transfer had completed and the files were available on the nas when in fact they weren't.  You also said it crashes, so I don't know if that played a part.  But you should mention it.  Especially if this is
[12:07] <codephobic> Anyway, I'm just shaken, as I say...
[12:07] <jrib> something that you can recreate, it would be useful to pin down and fix it
[12:08] <codephobic> jrib, I'll give it a go, I'm just not too well informed on the 'innards' of nautilus to provide much light in a bug report...

[12:10] <codephobic> right now, I just wanted to share my experience, get some ideas on alternatives and maybe even other potential causes...
[12:10] <jrib> codephobic: #ubuntu-bugs can help in creating a bug report.  Hopefully, eventually the bug gets triaged and you'll get asked more details that you may have left out

[12:58] <lovre> !lts
[12:58] <ubottu> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)
[12:58] <Sail> ok so i am doing ubuntu minimal install
[12:58] <lovre> what does it mean LTS is long term support, does it mean non-lts versions dont get updates? I never understood this clearly...*
[12:59] <cfhowlett> lovre, lts gets support for 60 months.
[12:59] <cfhowlett> lovre, non lts only gets 18
[12:59] <auronandace> lovre: lts releases are supported longer
[12:59] <cfhowlett> lovre, lts is also, generally speaking, a more polished release, i.e. less bleeding edge
[12:59] <Sail> ok so i am doing ubuntu minimal install now i am done with installtions i dont have xserver install now i want to install python-gnome2 can anybody show me the way
[12:59] <lovre> cfhowlett: what does that really mean? that non-lts will not get packages upgrades after that time?
[13:00] <jpds> Sail: sudo apt-get install python-gnome2 ?
[13:00] <lovre> cfhowlett: so if i want my system to be as stable as possible, i should remain on LTS version till the end, and then switch to another LTS?
[13:00] <radopi> lovre: yes
[13:00] <Godfather_> auronandace: i stopped it and then "startx" i get a black screen

[13:00] <Sail> jpds: i did tht but its showing blank desktop no applet nothing just blank desktop
[13:00] <lovre> cfhowlett: i see
[13:01] <cfhowlett> lovre, note that a new LTS release comes out every two years ...
[13:01] <lovre> cfhowlett: i am currently on 12.04.1 which is LTS. I did a dist-upgrade and it didnt allow me to upgrade to 12.10. Is this normal?
[13:01] <jpds> lovre: Yes.
[13:01] <auronandace> !dist-upgrade | lovre
[13:01] <ubottu> lovre: A dist-upgrade will install new dependencies for packages already installed and may remove packages if they are no longer needed. This will not bring you to a new release of Ubuntu, see !upgrade if that is your intention.
[13:01] <cfhowlett> lovre, so even though 12.04 is supported until 17.04, the next lts release will be 14.04 and 10.04 is still supported until 13.04
[13:01] <Godfather_> I get into the console "Protocol Not Specified"

[13:04] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: have you been running GUI apps with sudo. eg:  sudo nautilus
[13:04] <Godfather_> ActionParsnip: let me retry with my user

[13:05] <Godfather_> so i don't remember

[13:06] <lovre> another question :) when i install a program from the synaptic, i get the latest version. What if i want an older one?
[13:06] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: if you press CTRL+ALT+F1   can you log in there?
[13:06] <Godfather_> ActionParsnip: yes
[13:07] <cfhowlett> lovre, not sure why you'd want to but you can manually install older versions
[13:07] <Godfather_> but as i told you i can login with my usually user
[13:07] <Godfather_> i can login with another user
[13:07] <Godfather_> not with my typically user
[13:07] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: ok, log in as your user and run:  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME
[13:07] <lovre> cfhowlett: if i manually install, will i get updates for that software automatically? i guess not?
[13:07] <MonkeyDust> lovre  then you have to look outside the repos, but at your own risk
[13:07] <Godfather_> ok
[13:07] <ciccio> ciaohallo
[13:07] <cfhowlett> lovre, as monkeydust said, expect unintended consequences ...
[13:07] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: also run:  lspci | grep -i vga   when it is done, what is output?
[13:07] <lovre> cfhowlett: i see
[13:08] <lovre> clear

[13:09] <Godfather_> can i go to ctrl+alt+f2

[13:09] <Godfather_> to see this?

[13:13] <Guest78016> HI, when i start vmware in ubuntu 12.04 it shows message to install kernel module updater but virtual network device and few other devices are not working and error appears..as"unable to start services"
[13:13] <daftykins> Guest78016: often you have to run a configuration script vmware_config.pl or something first. i'd recommend you read the readme/docs
[13:13] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: what happened to 'its not an ati' ?
[13:13] <auronandace> Guest78016: virtualbox and qemu are in the repos, any reason you are using vmware?
[13:14] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: probably the chown
[13:14] <Godfather_> ActionParsnip: i thought it wasn't an ati
[13:14] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: if you run:  history | grep sudo | egrep 'nautilus|gedit'        do you get any output?
[13:15] <auronandace> Godfather_: amd took over ati
[13:15] <Godfather_> ActionParsnip:  yes, 2 lines
[13:16] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: then you are running GUI apps with sudo, which causes issues
[13:16] <Godfather_> auronandace: yes, but i believed it wasn't ati/amd
[13:16] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: use gksudo for GUI apps, sudo is NOT for GUI apps
[13:17] <Godfather_> ActionParsnip: anyway its very sick to break a system just for using a GUI APP with sudo, don't you think so?
[13:17] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: you will probably find that there were some files in your home folder which were owned by root:root due to them being mangled by sudo
[13:17] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: its what happens. Technically you can use gksudo for both
[13:17] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: kdesu in kde is the kde equiv
[13:18] <_porque> can someone help me with a bash where I need to get the remote from git remote -v, does someone know how?
[13:18] <YamakasY> _ruben: he man, also here ?
[13:18] <Godfather_> ActionParsnip:  i usually do 'sudo -s', and then i open some GUI APP, this could be a problem, isnt?
[13:19] <auronandace> !gksudo | Godfather_
[13:19] <ubottu> Godfather_: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[13:19] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: possibly. sudo -i   will use your user configs rather than root's
[13:21] <Godfather_> ok
[13:21] <Godfather_> thx to ActionParsnip auronandace  very very thx
[13:21] <Godfather_> i will use sudo -i or gksudo insited
[13:21] <auronandace> !yay | Godfather_
[13:21] <ubottu> Godfather_: Glad you made it! :-)
[13:21] <Godfather_> ubottu: thx to you also
[13:21] <ubottu> Godfather_: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)

[13:22] <meet> i have winxp desktop and ubuntu 12.04. how to share files between the two on my home network to which they both are connected?

[13:22] <auronandace> !samba | meet
[13:22] <ubottu> meet: Samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT.
[13:23] <meet> auronandace, there is no other way than samba?
[13:23] <iceroot> meet: just create a share on windows or on ubuntu (right click on a folder) then the other machine should be able to see it using the "network environment" in the explorer
[13:23] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: I actually email authors of how tos who use 'sudo gedit' in their guides to avoid this stuff :)
[13:24] <iceroot> meet: it will automaticly install samba when you create a share on ubuntu, so you dont have to deal with installing samba or configuring it by yourself
[13:24] <ActionParsnip> meet: could use an sftp server if you install openssh-server you will get one
[13:24] <Godfather_> ActionParsnip: i read http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo very interesting
[13:24] <ActionParsnip> meet: or you could run an FTP server (not secure but fine for LAN access)
[13:24] <meet> iceroot: and how do i access windows xp folders here?
[13:24] <Godfather_> its very common to see sudo gedit .. :-D
[13:25] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: yes, very annoying but i'm trying to clean it up one page at a time
[13:25] <iceroot> meet: open nautilis, click on "network" and it will show "WORKGROUP" or whatever your domain is called, click on that and you will see the windows machine and its share
[13:25] <Godfather_> ActionParsnip: its your page?
[13:25] <iceroot> meet: or just use \\windowshost  in the file-browser
[13:26] <ActionParsnip> Godfather_: no, its just one that highlights the issue well
[13:27] <Godfather_> ok
[13:27] <ActionParsnip> meet: did you share folders in windows?
[13:27] <meet> ActionParsnip: yes. but the folders are not visible. only the winxp machine is visible
[13:28] <WeechWeb> meet: Have you rightclicked/share folder
[13:28] <scarofthesun> hello
[13:28] <WeechWeb> Hello
[13:28] <meet> WeechWeb: in winxp i put them in the shared folders.
[13:28] <ActionParsnip> meet: if you run:  smbtree   in ubuntu, do you see the shares?
[13:28] <WeechWeb> Ok
[13:29] <ActionParsnip> meet: if you have a 3rd party firewall, is it allowing the traffic?
[13:29] <meet> ActionParsnip: i just installed ubuntu yesterday so no idea if by default is on.
[13:29] <WeechWeb> No
[13:29] <WeechWeb> meet: its not on by default
[13:30] <meet> ActionParsnip: smbree returned my pc name not the winxp machine in the list
[13:30] <ActionParsnip> meet: are both systems on the same network?
[13:30] <meet> yes
[13:30] <ActionParsnip> meet: cna you ping the XP system?
[13:30] <WeechWeb> meet: have you got a win PC to test it with, see if it can connect
[13:30] <WeechWeb> meet: to check if it is ubuntu or weather it is the whole network
[13:31] <meet> i shared a folder and was immediately visible on my android phone through the lan file browser. but my ubuntu machine is not being shown on winxp. WeechWeb , ActionParsnip
[13:32] <meet> ActionParsnip: ping as in ping ip address right?
[13:32] <WeechWeb> meet: yes
[13:32] <WeechWeb> meet: like ping 192.168.0.1 (example IP)
[13:32] <WeechWeb> meet: run this on your windows PC pinging your ubuntu pc and the outher way round
[13:33] <ActionParsnip> meet: whichever makes it work
[13:33] <atlef> my nas seems to be mounted ad afp and not smb, how do i change that
[13:33] <atlef> *as
[13:33] <meet> WeechWeb: how to find my ubuntu ip?
[13:33] <WeechWeb> meet: is it a GUI based ubuntu
[13:33] <meet> WeechWeb: yes
[13:34] <MonkeyDust> meet  knowing IP is the very basic thing if you want to setup a network, better do some reading, first
[13:34] <WeechWeb> meet: ifconfig eth0
[13:34] <meet> WeechWeb: considering the level of my problems i am having you should have guessed ;)
[13:34] <ActionParsnip> meet: run:  ip addr
[13:34] <_porque> does anyone here know of a bash command to open a browser pointing to my git repo? like https://github.com/blabla/test.git
[13:34] <ovidiu-florin> Hello World, how does ubuntu update an application that is running, without stopping it? what happenes in the background?
[13:34] <meet> MonkeyDust: i know that for windows but not for ubuntu
[13:34] <ioria> meet: do you have a network icon ?

[13:35] <ioria> meet: check info
[13:35] <meet> ioria: yes. in nautilus the windows network is visible but no machines or folders
[13:35] <WeechWeb> ovidiu-florin: i think it kills it
[13:35] <MonkeyDust> ztane  http://askubuntu.com/questions/48624/what-are-zombie-processes
[13:35] <ioria> meet: no .... in the bar
[13:35] <WeechWeb> meet: just use this http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/17012/how-to-find-your-ip-address-in-ubuntu/
[13:36] <ActionParsnip> meet: do you have a 3rd party firewall (not the windows firewall)
[13:36] <ponzellus> _porque: what about <your-browser-of-choice> https://github.com/...
[13:36] <ovidiu-florin> WeechWeb: no, it doesn't
[13:36] <meet> ActionParsnip: nope
[13:36] <ActionParsnip> meet: ip addr     in terminal will show the ip address
[13:36] <WeechWeb> meet: they are right, its basic networking, do you also know how to get the ip from your windows pc? ;)
[13:37] <meet> WeechWeb: yes
[13:37] <ztane> MonkeyDust: init-+-firefox---43*[{firefox}]
[13:37] <ztane> MonkeyDust: obviously not reaping
[13:37] <_porque> ponzellus, I need to make it run on anyones computer here...so I need to make it find if that folder is a git and get the remote...I already have this: https://gist.github.com/4538691
[13:38] <MonkeyDust> ztane  you can just ignore zombie processes, they'll go away
[13:38] <_porque> ponzellus, Now I need to get the remote and use xdg-open https://github.com/....
[13:38] <WeechWeb> meet: have you got your computers ip yet? if that command isnt working/spewing out to much data try ipconfig i find its layed out better
[13:38] <ztane> MonkeyDust: i cant
[13:38] <ztane> MonkeyDust: in this case they hold locks for example
[13:38] <meet> i am pretty sure there's no problem with the network. they are on the same network. as i said on my android I can access from both.
[13:38] <_porque> so the users here will enter a the git folder and type, open and it will open the browser in the git.com/blabla/test.git
[13:38] <ztane> or have pids matching pidfiles
[13:39] <WeechWeb> meet: test it to see if they can though
[13:39] <WeechWeb> meet: because it may be smething like ubuntu can ping windows but not the outher way round, or something wierd,
[13:39] <meet> WeechWeb: the ping's all right
[13:40] <meet> i mean both can ping each other
[13:40] <_porque> ponzellus, the problem also is that when I get the remote values I need bash think it is a path so I get No such file or directory
[13:40] <WeechWeb> meet: have you got FTP or anouther way to test
[13:41] <meet> WeechWeb: no.
[13:41] <ztane> obviously init must be stuck at something, but what??
[13:41] <ActionParsnip> meet: what is the name of the remote windows pc and what is the share name you made?
[13:41] <meet> my ubuntu pc is not visible in my network places on winxp.
[13:42] <meet> ActionParsnip: share name is folder name?
[13:42] <ponzellus> _porque: ah ok, didn't see that in your first question :D not a bash scripting expert, sorry :)
[13:42] <ActionParsnip> meet: its the name you gave the share when you shared it
[13:42] <_porque> ponzellus, np ;)
[13:42] <meet> ActionParsnip: i am trying to share the videos folder in my home directory on ubuntu.
[13:43] <meet> same name
[13:43] <ActionParsnip> meet: so is the share called 'videos'?
[13:43] <meet> ActionParsnip: yup
[13:43] <WeechWeb> meet: if its not streaming cant you try FTP? or is it streaming
[13:43] <ActionParsnip> meet: and what is the XP hostname?

[13:45] <WeechWeb> meet: or open terminal
[13:46] <meet> ActionParsnip: i am sharing a folder from ubuntu. so should that command be \\myubuntu\videos?

[13:50] <meet> ActionParsnip: on the workgroup i am able to see only my ubuntu pc and not winxp machine.. what do i try next?
[13:50] <ActionParsnip> meet: what workgroup is the XP system in and which is the Ubuntu system in ?
[13:50] <meet> ActionParsnip: they are the same name
[13:52] <ioria> meet: sorry, but i think that you should have a windows network  icon and inside it mshome and workgroup's icons

[14:08] <WeechWeb> meet: dont worry, once you get the hang of it its good, acleast u learnet
[14:08] <blez> anathema_ I need the same thing.
[14:08] <challengerX> anathema : first install windows then ubuntu

[14:17] <cfhowlett> BluesKaj, greetings!
[14:18] <BluesKaj> hi cfhowlett
[14:18] <jrib> _porque: put something like "echo var is $var" after every line where you set a variable, then show the output.  So for example: echo remotes is "$remotes"
[14:19] <_porque> jrib, ok
[14:20] <_porque> jrib, doing this with the remote_url I get this: bash: planobe/walk-manager-3.git: No such file or directory
[14:20] <_porque> remote_url is
[14:21] <jrib> _porque: oh right, now I see it.  Your remote_url line is weird...
[14:22] <jrib> _porque: you can put "echo" before "$remotes" if you want
[14:23] <_porque> jrib, same thing
[14:23] <jrib> _porque: show the new version
[14:23] <_porque> jrib, http://askubuntu.com/questions/243464/bash-function-to-open-git-repository-with-browser

[14:25] <_porque> jrib, maybe, I'm new to bash, what I need is to get its value
[14:25] <_porque> jrib, not execute it
[14:26] <jrib> _porque: in your terminal you would do: « echo foo bar | cut -d" " -f1 », but you instead are doing: « foo bar | cut -d" " -f1 ».  do you understand?
[14:26] <_porque> jrib, yes, I get it...
[14:26] <_porque> jrib, is there a way to "save" the return from this execution?
[14:27] <Eagleman> output it to a file ?
[14:27] <jrib> _porque: what you had before in your gist post was fine, just put "echo" before "$remotes"
[14:28] <_porque> jrib, but it will print the value in the terminal, I need it to concatenate with another string: I need something like this: https://github.com/bla/my_project.git, where my_project.git will be dynamic, depending on the folder you are
[14:28] <Eagleman> Can i safelly delete  postfix-script and post-install in /etc/postfix/ ?
[14:29] <_porque> jrib, this: $remotes | cut -d" " -f1 is getting the value from "git remove -v" origin

[16:26] <bluegoon> Hi guys
[16:26] <TheGrey> o/ Can I ask something?......I've been running ubuntu and intermittently I have no connection with my mouse and keyboard...How can I find out a solution or bug report?
[16:26] <bluegoon> I cant type the 'hash' and 'at' symbols
[16:27] <FlowRiser> TheGrey, are they both on usb ?
[16:27] <ezio> TheGrey, you have to sit down and have a long talk with them.  that's the only way to develop a connection with your mouse and keyboard.
[16:27] <NET||abuse> hi folks, was going to try StarTrekOnline and had some issues with it, anyone here play STO? I can't click on Options or Patch on the launcher window
[16:27] <ezio> you should tell them about the dangers of drugs and strangers, too
[16:27] <TheGrey> FlowRiser: yes they're both on usb
[16:28] <FlowRiser> TheGrey, can you find them by running lsusb ?
[16:28] <NET||abuse> I'm using GC_DONT_GC=1  flags on the launcher for wine.
[16:28] <NET||abuse> i've install ie8 and vcrun 2008
[16:28] <ActionParsnip> harushimo: install the libsdl1.2-dev  package and you'll get it
[16:28] <MonkeyDust> NET||abuse  ask in #winehq
[16:28] <ezio> TheGrey, how are you doing anything without a mouse and keyboard?
[16:28] <NET||abuse> hmm, ok
[16:28] <NET||abuse> didn't know about that channel :)
[16:28] <harushimo> ActionParsnip: thank you
=== ryanclancy000 is now known as Guest63235
[16:28] <FlowRiser> ezio, good point O.o
[16:28] <NET||abuse> MonkeyDust: thanks for the pointer
[16:28] <TheGrey> FlowrRiser: Yes, they are both Razer USA, Ltd.
[16:28] <ActionParsnip> NET||abuse: did you check the appdb?
[16:28] <TheGrey> ezio: this is me after a reboot
[16:29] <bluegoon> How do you type the AT sign on a UK keyboard?
[16:29] <arand> harushimo: Normally install the packages libsdl-image1.2 and/or libsdl-mixer1.2 if you just need the libraries, libsdl1.2-dev if you want the development files for compiling as well.
[16:29] <ActionParsnip> bluegoon: shift + seconds key on right on the middle row
[16:29] <ezio> TheGrey, huh?  how are you typing anything
[16:29] <ezio> into linux
[16:29] <ActionParsnip> bluegoon: not counting the enter key
[16:30] <FlowRiser> TheGrey, Razer ?  oh, damn... they have all sorts of weird functions; tried searching the developers website for linux drivers ?
[16:30] <harushimo> arand: I need the development one too
[16:30] <TheGrey> ezio: This is a reboot...there is no problem atm. It happens intermittently. I'm looking for a solution
[16:30] <NET||abuse> ActionParsnip: yeh i didn, didn't see my issue, but generally they just said you probably need to try GV_DONT_GV=1 and have vcrun2008 and IE8 through winetricks
[16:30] <ActionParsnip> bluegoon: http://www.goodtyping.com/teclatUKok.png   image searching is your friend
[16:30] <harushimo> arand: pygame requires it
[16:30] <TheGrey> FlowrRiser; cheers will do!
[16:30] <arand> harushimo: Then just the -dev package (as ActionParsnip said)
[16:30] <ezio> TheGrey, ah ... intermittently ... are you sure the os isn't frozen solid?
[16:30] <ezio> TheGrey, when this happens have you tried ctrl+alt+f1
[16:31] <harushimo> arand: I am. I'll install the other two packages what you said
[16:31] <TheGrey> ezio: right cheers
[16:32] <ezio>  try that ... see if you get a terminal
[16:32] <ezio> if you do then you can just reboot your dm by /etc/init.d/ldm restart
[16:33] <ezio> if you have the standard install
[16:33] <arand> harushimo: Hmm, it might be that you want libsdl-image1.2-dev and libsdl-mixer1.2-dev separately as well, yeah (I've no experience with pygame though).
[16:33] <Bouib> hello$
[16:34] <harushimo> arand: that's okay. I'll figure it out but you gave me direction on the problem

[16:38] <bean__> DJones: he does NOT want pound as @
[16:39] <xomrk> not work
[16:39] <jrib> xomrk: have you tried basename...?

[16:39] <xomrk> what that is?
[16:39] <jrib> xomrk: a command.
[16:40] <xomrk> i create a script to find and copy songs

[17:18] <Guest97701> ActionParsnip: all i need to know tht its not important to install unity or gnome to get mate desktop?

[17:21] <ActionParsnip> Guest97701: mate is a fork of gnome, so it will use gnome stuff from the official repos mixed with the stuff from the ppa
[17:22] <Guest97701> ActionParsnip: so it means i have to install gnome first to use mate?
[17:23] <ActionParsnip> Guest97701: no, just add the ppa then install mate, it will install what is needed

[17:23] <ActionParsnip> Guest97701: no worries
[17:24] <Kion1> ActionParsnip: No, Uninstall from a dual boot working system
[17:24] <Kion1> ActionParsnip: It is for a friend, that will update his computer and will give the old to somebody
[17:25] <ActionParsnip> Kion1: yes, how did you install ubuntu? there are 2 ways to install it, so there are 2 removal methods...
[17:25] <dangersalad> anybody here started playing with the ubuntu phone sdk
[17:25] <Kion1> ActionParsnip: sorry, did not read correctly, my bad, I am not shure, I guess he had windows preinstalled and booted with a cd...
=== me is now known as Guest49426
[17:26] <ActionParsnip> Kion1: ok, so in Ubuntu if you run:  sudo fdisk -l    do you see Linux partitions and NTFS partitions?
[17:26] <Kion1> ActionParsnip: yes, he has a windows partition and a linux partition
[17:27] <ActionParsnip> Kion1: then boot to windows and delete the Linux partitions. You will need to use a Windows CD to reinstate the boot loader
[17:27] <dangersalad> I am trying to get the XmlListModel from the demo working and it is not pulling data
[17:27] <ActionParsnip> Kion1: you can then make a partition of the freed space for user data storage etc
[17:28] <Kion1> ActionParsnip: Yes my first thought was to format the linux partition and use it from windows, my only obscure area is how to fix the boot loader
[17:28] <ActionParsnip> Kion1: you'll need the windows CD, or supergrub (may work)
[17:29] <Kion1> ActionParsnip: I thought of modifying grub to automaticlly choose windows with time =0, but I know this is not elegant but rather rudimentary
[17:29] <ActionParsnip> Kion1: when you delete the ubuntu parftitions, all the config files will go too
[17:30] <Kion1> ActionParsnip: I see, including groob...
[17:30] <ActionParsnip> Kion1: if you have a windows CD, you can put the boot loader back on the mbr, the ##windows can help you with that
[17:31] <ActionParsnip> Kion1: grub will be on the mbr still, but there is no /boot partition to look at etc, so it will just sit and expect you to boot it manualy by typing the boot command
[17:31] <Kion1> ActionParsnip: Ok thanks!   so step 1 , format the ext4 partition, step 2 reinstall windows boot loader with their disk
[17:31] <ActionParsnip> commands*
[17:32] <hje841> How do you deploy a gSOAP webservice written as a stand alone server in C++?
[17:33] <Kion1> ActionParsnip: Thanks!

[17:35] <biglinux> hello

[17:37] <FunGoat_> Is it possible to create a live USB for another distro via startup disk creator? Doesn't let me select iso in question. Does it only work for Ubuntu ISO's?
[17:37] <bazhang> FunGoat_, try unetbootin for that

[18:34] <zex> I do not have 15 TB on my ubunti server
[18:34] <histo> zex: you need to get the ubuntu machine to see the content first outside of plex.  Test one thing at a time.
[18:34] <cleardown> should i disable
[18:35] <orbitwhite> Benkinooby, which card u have?
[18:35] <zex> yes that is what I am trying histo

[18:38] <DWSR> histo: Doesn't FreeNAS support NFS shares?
[18:38] <DWSR> histo: Because that would probably be the easiest.

[18:38] <zex> it does support NFS

[18:40] <phunyguy> I have another question for the group.  On my work PC, I have to proxy EVERYTHING, so I have that set up system-wide via system-settings.  However there is one small thing that doesn't get proxied, and I can't figure out how to make it proxy.  The flash plugin says that extra stuff needs to be downloaded, and i can run this action now, or close.  It never runs when I tell it to, it just times out.
[18:40] <DWSR> ActionParsnip: It's a Dell PowerEdge 2950. I wasn't aware that Ubuntu's base drivers were so poor that they don't support 6 year old hardware.

[18:41] <DWSR> ActionParsnip: I just need to change the refresh rate.
[18:41] <blkadder> zex: And what share are you trying to see?
[18:41] <orbitwhite> Benkinooby, this could also help, read it carefully it may contain keys to whats goint on http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#firmware
[18:42] <blkadder> The /mnt/FreeNas?
[18:42] <zex> yes
[18:42] <blkadder> Ok first that is exported as NFS.
[18:42] <histo> zex: what are you posting your fstab from Freenas
[18:42] <blkadder> So what is all of this stuff about Apple shares?
[18:42] <zex> yes
[18:42] <histo> zex: Why?
[18:43] <blkadder> I asked him to histo
[18:43] <histo> zex: there isn't a problem with freenas there is a problem with Ubuntu.
[18:43] <blkadder> I wanted to see how he had stuff exported.
[18:43] <zex> cause I have an apple Macbook?
[18:43] <zex> correct
[18:43] <blkadder> Right but your server is exporting NFS.
[18:43] <blkadder> Not AFP
[18:43] <histo> zex: so Ubuntu can see the share but plex cant
[18:43] <histo> blkadder: doesnt' matter
[18:43] <DWSR> zex: ls /mnt/FreeNas
[18:43] <DWSR> Does that give you back the contents of your share?
[18:44] <blkadder> histo: Depending on how he is trying to mount it it might.
[18:44] <zex> plex askes the location of the share
[18:44] <zex> ot location of the folder where you media is located
[18:44] <histo> zex: But am I right that Ubuntu can see the share and browse it
[18:44] <mbeierl> Using lubuntu 12.10 - I accidentally clicked on a notification where it said "don't show this message again."  Does anyone know how to get that back, or to reset the notification settings?
[18:44] <histo> ?
[18:45] <zex> yep if I use Nautilus
[18:45] <blkadder> zex: Is the issue that you can't see it on your Macbook or on Ubuntu?
[18:45] <DWSR> zex: You can either tell Plex the share name for Ubuntu remotely.
[18:45] <histo> blkadder: he can't see it in a program called plex
[18:45] <MonkeyDust> what's plex?
[18:45] <DWSR> zex: Or you can tell Plex the local folder it's located in (/mnt/FreeNas)
[18:45] <blkadder> But he can see it in the OS?
[18:45] <DWSR> MonkeyDust: plexapp.com
[18:45] <histo> zex: You need to mount the share on your ubuntu machine.
[18:45] <orbitwhite> D:
[18:45] <zex> I am tryung to see the share from ubuntu for plex . SHare is on my freenas
[18:45] <histo> zex: then just point plex at the mounted folder
[18:46] <DWSR> histo: Unless of course he's having permissions issues.
[18:46] <zex> where does ubuntu map the share to is I use nautilus/?
[18:46] <zex> I have looked under /mnt but it is nt there
[18:46] <DWSR> ActionParsnip: aticonfig --initial "no supported adapters detected"
[18:46] <histo> zex: it's in a folder under your home
[18:46] <blkadder> zex: Go to a shell on the Ubuntu server and do a "mount" and send me the output.
[18:46] <ActionParsnip> zex: look in /run
[18:47] <zex> http://pastebin.com/KPu71akc
[18:47] <ActionParsnip> zex: you will find a folder for your user and then a folder called gvfs

[18:48] <zex> omg
[18:48] <zex> one sec
[18:48] <ActionParsnip> zex: try:  sudo updatedb; locate gvfs   what is output?

[18:50] <ShapeShifter499> hi again
[18:50] <ActionParsnip> histo: once it's mounted in gui, it goes into the folder in /run which can be used
[18:50] <ShapeShifter499> ubuntu 12 should run in virtual pc 7 right?
[18:50] <histo> ActionParsnip: I think it goes in a .gvfs folder in the users home I believe
[18:51] <histo> ActionParsnip: with some uuid numbering or somehting
[18:51] <zex> ok I can see the map : /run/user/arthur/gvfs/afp-volume:host=Freenas.local,user=anonymous,volume=Movies$
[18:51] <ActionParsnip> histo: not any more, look at the mount output
[18:51] <MonkeyDust> ShapeShifter499  you mean as a virtual machine in win7?
[18:51] <zex> but plex does nto see that
[18:51] <histo> ActionParsnip: When did they switch the way nautilus does it?
[18:51] <ActionParsnip> zex: could run:  ln -s /run/user/arthur/gvfs/afp-volume ~/NAS
[18:51] <histo> zex: just mount it manually like I instructed
[18:51] <ActionParsnip> histo: no idea
[18:51] <histo> zex: first unmount it
[18:52] <zex> histo let me try one sec please
[18:52] <ActionParsnip> zex: try the command, it should work

[18:53] <johndoe_> Hi. I've been using dhclient in a script to search for dhcp servers for some network surveillance. Now, dhclient was turned into an upstart script and I get complains using my script. How can I run a dhcp client on a specific interface and only on that interface at any time?
[18:53] <ShapeShifter499> I really want to use my old powerbook g4 /w powerpc for video streaming/media center, airplay, and a server but the tools for airplay and media only seem to work on mac os 10.5 and no where else, so I'd have to run ubuntu in the background with virtual pc 7 or qemu, which from research is slow on this comp
[18:53] <ShapeShifter499> MonkeyDust, no I mean the old vitual pc 7 for powerpc machines
[18:53] <zex> mount: can't find //192.168.254.8/Movies in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[18:54] <zex> also tied this mount: can't find //freenas.local/Movies in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[18:54] <histo> zex: sudo mount
[18:54] <MonkeyDust> ShapeShifter499  what do you mean by 'ubuntu in the background'? of what exactly?
[18:54] <ActionParsnip> zex: did the symlink work ok?
[18:55] <zex> the link is there
[18:55] <zex> yes and I can see the content
[18:55] <histo> ActionParsnip: he needs to learn how to mount it then he can put it in his fstab on the ubuntu box. rather than having to browse to it first in nautilus then openinjg plex
[18:55] <zex> but how do I add that folder to Plex? as the broswer interface does nto go past this position in link

[18:56] <user82> battery out in reboot?
[18:57] <zex> I can oly get to : /run/user/arthur
[18:57] <ShapeShifter499> MonkeyDust, my setup would be Mac OS X 10.5 with xbmc + airserver for the media center and ubuntu 12 running in some virtualization (qemu, a older virtualbox version, or virtual pc 7) for the server tools
[18:57] <zex> can not see gvfs folder
[18:57] <histo> zex: sudo mount 192.168.254.8:/path/to/Movies /where/ever/you/want/to/mount
[18:57] <histo> zex: that would use NFS

[18:58] <ShapeShifter499> MonkeyDust, right now I'm installing Mac OS X 10.5 on this old powerbook g4, haven't looked into running ubuntu in virtual pc yet so I don't know if that would work

[18:59] <ubuntu-tester> user82: what capacity system reports?
[18:59] <zex> http://pastebin.com/XRrq3QRq
[18:59] <ShapeShifter499> MonkeyDust, from what I researched VirtualPC7 is the last version that works for powerpc systems and I'm not sure if ubuntu will work on it
[18:59] <blkadder> That is a FreeNAS server config issue.
[18:59] <histo> zex: is the share in /mnt/FreeNAS
[18:59] <user82> ubuntu-tester gnome energy monitor says: energy(design) 51.4Wh(correct) Capacity when fully charged: 134.2Wh(totally wring)
[19:00] <histo> zex: or is it /mnt/FreeNas/Movies
[19:00] <user82> so the percentage is totally wrong...the time left not
[19:00] <zex> in /mnt/FreeNas/Movies
[19:00] <ShapeShifter499> MonkeyDust, also Virtual PC 7 seems to be the fastest virtualization software I can use
[19:00] <MonkeyDust> ShapeShifter499  give it try and post your findings as a review
[19:00] <zex> I di d
[19:00] <zex> I did sudo mount 192.168.254.8:/mnt/FreeNas/Movies /mnt
[19:00] <zex> and it did nto bitch
[19:01] <blkadder> Then try mount 192.168.254:/mnt/FreeNas/Movies
[19:01] <histo> zex: now plex should be able to browse /mnt and see the content
[19:01] <zex> let me see
[19:01] <histo> blkadder: please
[19:01] <ShapeShifter499> MonkeyDust, ok, sure
[19:02] <zex> ffs when I browse to /mnt I soo nothing
[19:02] <zex> see nothing
[19:02] <zex> when i go cd /mnt I get -bash: cd: /mnt/: Permission denied
[19:02] <ActionParsnip> zex: i'd just mount it using GUI, then use the symlink :)
[19:02] <histo> ActionParsnip: then he needs to do that everytime before using plex.
[19:02] <blkadder> ls -al /mnt
[19:03] <ActionParsnip> histo: least there is a way to get it flying til the mount can be made
[19:03] <histo> I thought he wanted to do this in fstab anyways.... Maybe i'm confused. I just want him to mount it normally first
[19:03] <histo> zex: please type just "mount" in a terminal and pastebin the output.
[19:03] <zex> 192.168.254.8:/mnt/FreeNas/Movies on /mnt type nfs (rw,addr=192.168.254.8)
[19:04] <zex> seems it is mounted... but now how do I point plex to that mount point?
[19:04] <telematika> alo
[19:04] <histo> zex: can you ls /mnt/  do you see any files?

[19:08] <histo> zex: no you have to use sudo to get a directory listing currently?
[19:08] <histo> there is a permissionis issue please do blkadders command
[19:08] <zex> ye I had to use sudo

[19:10] <zex> let me chekc it out thanks guys!!!
[19:12] <histo> zex: also why wouldn't you put the plex media server on the freenas box.
[19:12] <zex> you can't :P
[19:12] <histo> zex: and then the clients on the other boxes.
[19:13] <histo> zex: do they even make a ubuntu app to browse your media then?
[19:13] <zex> nope :P hence the drive to see if I get the share to work
[19:14] <histo> zex: What are you going to use as a plex client?
[19:14] <zex> appletv
[19:14] <zex> from that link they suggest this sudo mount -o soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 192.168.1.1:/viveks /nfs
[19:14] <histo> ahh
[19:14] <zex> I get access denied by server while mounting 192.168.254.8:/viveks
[19:14] <zex> I have one question
[19:15] <histo> zex: becuae /viveks is the directory yours is /mnt/FreeNas/Movies  remember
[19:15] <zex> I have a TV that is NDLA enabled
[19:15] <zex> will it be able to see the plex ?
[19:15] <histo> zex: then there are easier ways to do this.
[19:15] <raven> anyone who knows about xslt?
[19:15] <zex> server?
[19:15] <zex> please tel me
[19:15] <histo> zex: I don't know if plex does dlna or what protocal its using.
[19:15] <zex> I think it is
[19:15] <histo> zex: then yes
[19:16] <histo> zex: You have an issue understanding the mount command. Let me give you an example.
[19:17] <histo> zex: mount -o options,that,you,want ip.address.of.freenas:/path_to_share_on_freenas_box /directory_that_you_want_to_mount_to_must_exist

[19:22] <rich> Hi there, I was looking for some help installing ubuntu on vm fusion, am I in the right place?
[19:22] <histo> zex: This is all due to a misunderstanding of how the mount command works.
[19:22] <histo> rich: what sort of problems are you having?
[19:23] <zex> lok guys I had it for one day. I am no expert hence soem of the problems
[19:23] <zex> thansk for the help
[19:23] <histo> zex: I would just read up on the mount commmand and understand that first
[19:24] <histo> zex: and what it does. Then you will see how silly this all is once you understand it.
[19:24] <zex> will do thanks guys

[20:25] <ActionParsnip> Tion: so you propose a possible non booting OS for hunan readability.  For the audience of ubuntu.  Not going to happen
[20:25] <Guest11330> is it possible to install ubuntu 12.04 with other bootloader than grub 2?
[20:25] <niclas> I recently started using Ubuntu (coming from Windows) and I'm stuck on trying to get Python 3.3 and Django 1.5 working. Could someone help me out a bit?
[20:25] <tion> this bug wasnt adfressed has NSA likes to have really access to HW UIDS
[20:26] <tion> thats the only reason
[20:26] <tion> that and to piss me off
[20:26] <ActionParsnip> Guest11330: sure.  LILO is in the repos too
[20:26] <bekks> tion: Of course you can still use the ancient /dev/sdXY notation.
[20:27] <POVaddct> tion: UUIDs are _not_ hardware IDs
[20:27] <tion> not for long since ubuntu is going TM way
[20:27] <POVaddct> tion: at least filesystem UUIDs aren't
[20:27] <ActionParsnip> Tion: you can still mount in the old style yourself

[20:28] <ubuntu-tester> POVaddct: ...and that label has to be UUID to be reliable
[20:28] <jaker555> how to give root persmission to a folder ?
[20:28] <ActionParsnip> Jaker555: do you mean ownership
[20:28] <jaker555> ownership yes
[20:29] <jaker555> if i change it to my admin account other than " root " it breaks ubuntu
[20:29] <Guest11330> ActionParsnip , so i first install ubuntu with grub 2 which is the the one that comes with live cd and then change it to lilo using software source?
[20:29] <ActionParsnip> Jaker555: look into chown. Be careful
[20:29] <tion> can i resize / once i upgrade FS to ext4?
[20:29] <bekks> jaker555: Which folder do you talk about?
=== milind is now known as abyss42
[20:29] <jaker555> yes but what do i do with chown ? i use $user for my admin account
[20:29] <jaker555> in var/log/gdm <- locked to root
[20:29] <jaker555> if i change it to my jaker account it breaks ubuntu
[20:29] <POVaddct> ubuntu-tester: i agree that fs UUIDs are more reliable than fs labels. but they would be more human readable.
[20:29] <ActionParsnip> Guest11330: yes. Imstall lilo and remove grub
[20:29] <jaker555> the theme disappear
[20:29] <ubuntu-tester> Midec: what installation media do you have?
[20:30] <bekks> jaker555: Then just leave it as it is. What do you want to achieve actually?
[20:30] <tion> UIDS are machine code
[20:30] <ActionParsnip> Jaker555: why not just run: gksudo gedit       then open the file
[20:30] <bekks> tion: Thats just not true. :)
[20:30] <Midec> ubuntu-tester: what do you mean?  i am using a USB stick to do the install(i am a big noob at this)
=== root is now known as Guest19118
[20:31] <michele> i already have ubuntu-server installed. how do I launch the tasksel for "ubuntu software selection" (like http://askubuntu.com/questions/153265/what-does-the-basic-ubuntu-server-package-contain-in-software-selection-during ) ?
[20:31] <POVaddct> tion: UUIDs are not code at all. they are just big numbers, randomly generated.
[20:31] <tion> yes
[20:31] <tion> they are made by machines for machines
[20:31] <jaker555> actionparsnip i don't have time for that
[20:31] <jaker555> logs are not important
[20:31] <bekks> jaker555: Then just leave it as it is. What do you want to achieve actually?
[20:31] <jaker555> i want full access
[20:32] <jhalfrezi> not quite successful :(
[20:32] <bekks> jaker555: So you want to access it with another user, as well?
[20:32] <ActionParsnip> Tion: the UUID is generated when the partition is made. Thats how each one has a UUID
[20:32] <POVaddct> tion: then "machine code" is the wrong term because it refers to something executable
[20:32] <jhalfrezi> as soon as I plug in the eth0 cable, the wireless disappears
[20:32] <Guest11330> ActionParsnip , i want to try this because using an usb stick with ubuntu 12.04 makes my computer freeze at boot. i cant even enter bios. what do you think?
[20:32] <jhalfrezi> from the network manager
[20:32] <jhalfrezi> and if it is connected, it disconnects itself
[20:32] <ActionParsnip> Jaker555: you have it via sudo and gksudo
[20:33] <tion> i was being ironic/sarcastic
[20:33] <jhalfrezi> and if I happen to modify the wireles config an choose to save for all users, it goes on step ahead and deletes _all_ configurations
[20:33] <jhalfrezi> which is quite like the intended purpose, inversely speaking
[20:33] <Haematoma> ActionParsnip: For dealing with USB HDDs, is there an advantage of using UUID over serial no. to identify a particular drive.
[20:33] <tion> machine code isnt human readable
[20:33] <Haematoma> ?*
[20:33] <bekks> Haematoma: Sure.
[20:33] <bekks> tion: But UUID are human-readable.
[20:33] <tion> can i resize / once i upgrade FS to ext4?
[20:34] <Haematoma> bekks: what would that advantage be?
[20:34] <jaker555> ok ignore it guys.. i will try ti find out how to chown it
[20:34] <jaker555> in after few hours of serach
[20:34] <tion> just like code bars are human readable
[20:34] <bekks> Haematoma: Uniquely identifying your USB filesystem.
[20:34] <ActionParsnip> Jaker555 : its an extra word in a command.  Yet you have time to ask and wait for an answer in IRC
[20:34] <POVaddct> hehe
[20:34] <tion> can i resize / once i upgrade FS to ext4?
[20:34] <bekks> tion: Then stop argueing, and just do not use them.
[20:34] <jaker555> no probvlem guys
[20:34] <ActionParsnip> Jaker555: not weird?
[20:34] <jaker555> you just stress us too much so we stick with linux
[20:34] <bekks> tion: And stop asking your question on and on again.
[20:35] <Haematoma> bekks: so uuid implicitly tells us the partition filesystem?
[20:35] <tion> ive got this question a timer till someone ansers
[20:35] <bekks> Haematoma: The UUID is stored in the filesystem header. It tells us: "This filesystem has the UUID xyz."
[20:36] <Haematoma> bekks: kk, that makes sense
[20:36] <bekks> tion: Then please dont mind setting you onto ignore until then.
[20:36] <tion> Haematoma, dont tell you anything other that an serial number
[20:36] <Guest11330> ActionParsnip , i want to try this because using an usb stick with ubuntu 12.04 makes my computer freeze at boot. i cant even enter bios. but i boot plop whithout the usb stick and connect it when at plop menu.what do you think?
[20:36] <POVaddct> tion: looks like ext4 can be resized online (in mounted state) if it is not the root filesystem: http://askubuntu.com/questions/24027/how-to-resize-a-ext4-root-partition-at-runtime
[20:36] <slowz> tion, you can resize ext4 so long as its not mounted
[20:36] <bekks> Haematoma: A _unique_ number.
=== mike_ is now known as Guest96729

[20:38] <mcclainreynolds> I have the iso downloaded
[20:38] <mcclainreynolds> I'm on a mac
[20:38] <slowz> tion, i would use a live cd with gparted. i dont know anything about eseus
[20:38] <FloodBot1> mcclainreynolds: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[20:38] <POVaddct> this is ubuntu support, we don't know about obscure windows tools

[20:39] <slowz> usb stick?
[20:39] <BroUnicorn> Yeah
[20:39] <jhalfrezi> does anyone know why when network-manager detects link eth0, it immediately disconnects the wireless?
[20:39] <BroUnicorn> I'm mcclain btw
[20:39] <tion> can i use my usb mp3 player to install gparted on?
[20:39] <jhalfrezi> any suggestions on how to keep both network would be great :)

[20:40] <Guest11330> ActionParsnip , never mind i ll have to try it anyway.

[20:49] <fidel_> BroUnicorn: hdiutil should be able to convert dmg to iso afaik
[20:49] <fidel_> its a osx cli tool
[20:49] <Midec> ubottu:  I did, i said i was using 12.10 32bit, and im trying to install 12.04 64bit, and i get the error "input/output error during read on /dev/sda"     it happens right after i manually set up the partitions, and when i just do erase disc and install ubuntu,
[20:49] <ubottu> Midec: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[20:50] <ioria> Midec: are you installing from usb ?
[20:50] <Midec> ioria: yes i am
[20:50] <Bino1710> @hillary - did you  ever have the printer working with any version of ubuntu?
[20:50] <BroUnicorn> fidel_: I just used that to convert the iso to an img… do I have to redo it?
[20:50] <bekks> BroUnicorn: Isnt Mac capable of dealing with iso files?
[20:50] <phunyguy> Why do I always have to tell Ubuntu to restart TWICE before it actually acknowledges a restart command?
[20:50] <bekks> BroUnicorn: No, you dont have to convert it again.
[20:50] <phunyguy> ALWAYS.
[20:50] <fidel_> BroUnicorn: then ignore my input - i might misinterpreted it
[20:50] <hillary> yes last week it was working with this 12.04 lts very well
[20:51] <slowz> Midec, ive had that error before. it was a disk going back. i know that not much help but that was my issue with the input/output error
[20:51] <BroUnicorn> bekks: I'm following the instructions on http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx -it states that OSX may append .dmg, but it doesn't say whether this is an error or not
[20:51] <slowz> *disk going bad*
[20:51] <hillary> yesterday it stopped detecting even the scanner
[20:51] <Midec> slowz:  what did you do to fix it?
[20:51] <Bino1710> sound like you may have to reinstall the drivers
[20:51] <slowz> Midec, bought a new disk
[20:51] <ioria> Midec: maybe bad sectors
[20:51] <bekks> BroUnicorn: No, it is not an error.
[20:52] <Midec> slowz:  so how come i can normally use the laptop as it currently is?  i just get this error when im trying to do a fresh install.
[20:52] <BroUnicorn> bekks: So I should just carry on?
[20:52] <bekks> BroUnicorn: Yes.
[20:52] <Midec> slowz:  should i just reformat it while i am logged on normally, and then proceed?
[20:53] <slowz> Midec, i did cheat and give myself some time by partitioning only the last half of the disk. the bad area was only on the first part of the disk
[20:53] <bekks> Midec: You cannot format anything while being logged in.
[20:53] <tion> can i use tune2fs  using uuIDs?
[20:53] <ioria> Midec: did you download from official mirror ?
[20:53] <Midec> bekks:  i thought i could use gparted or something?
[20:53] <bekks> Midec: Just boot from the installation cd.
[20:54] <bekks> Midec: You cant use gparted from a running system.
[20:54] <hillary> what do i do
[20:54] <Midec> ioria: yes, i downloaded yesturday from the website
[20:54] <Midec> bekks:  so should i just throw gparted on a usb and boot it, then try?
[20:54] <bekks> Midec: Yes.
[20:55] <Midec> bekks:  alright i'll try that, i guess if that doesn't work, ill have to go out n' buy a new hard drive :/
[20:55] <bekks> Midec: No.
[20:55] <ioria> Midec: try before the alternate
[20:55] <bekks> Midec: If that "doesnt work", you have to deactivate swap, and try again.
[20:56] <tion> uuids are spam
[20:56] <Midec> bekks:  so when i am setting up partitions don't include a swap?
[20:57] <bekks> Midec: Thats not what I said. An existing swap partition is maybe used by a livecd. So you have to deactivate it before being able to perform actions with gparted.

[21:06] <mrmycorn> 12.1
[21:06] <nick__> MonkeyDust: I have quite a problem with it, I have set another download location but everytime I restart Deluge it's back to the defualt. I have read it's a bug within GTK?
[21:07] <Ronalds_M> hello
[21:07] <Ronalds_M> I lost chromium tabs after update
[21:07] <Ronalds_M> no tabs showing by default
[21:09] <MonkeyDust> nick__  it's odd, the location stays as i changed it - did you click 'apply'? - there's also 'move completed to'
[21:11] <milton> hello...
[21:11] <milton> anyone help me with a flash problem?
[21:11] <nick__> MonkeyDust: Yep, I clicked apply. When I exit Deluge and starts it up again, it's back to defualt.
[21:11] <Ronalds_M> I lost chromium tabs after update, is it design flaw or something?
[21:12] <nick__> MonkeyDust: But from what I can see, it should help to downgrade GTK+ to 2.24.10
[21:12] <ilikepandas> software center was released in summer of 2011 correct?
[21:13] <MonkeyDust> nick__  don't downgrade, you'l ruin your system - delete ~/.config/deluge   then restart deluge and change the location
[21:14] <BroUnicorn> so I got to step 8 on this
[21:15] <BroUnicorn> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx. I typed the code. It asked for my password for sudo. I entered it but nothing happened....

[21:18] <nick__> MonkeyDust: Didn't fix it, hmm :(
[21:18] <nick__> MonkeyDust: Is there any other torrent clients worth using?
[21:18] <ilikepandas_> but its not clear when software center first released, since ubuntu used synaptics package manager which is kind of similar to install software.
[21:18] <dr_willis> dozens of torrent clients out there.
[21:18] <BroUnicorn> dr_willis: Thanks! I reran the command. I entered my password (I believe, although I can't see anything being typed). Now it's just sitting there.. so we'll see if it corrects it.

[21:19] <ilikepandas_> why am i getting ping timeout
[21:19] <MonkeyDust> nick__  transmission is the most common
[21:19] <nick__> MonkeyDust: I fixed it!
[21:19] <BroUnicorn> dr_willis: That's definitely true. I'm just wondering whether it's working or not since it didn't pop up any type of message..
[21:19] <MonkeyDust> nick__  how did you do it?
[21:20] <ilikepandas_> nick__: utorrent is master.
[21:20] <dr_willis> BroUnicorn:  dd command dosent give any feedback by default.  Theres ways to moniotors its progress.
[21:20] <nick__> MonkeyDust:I found this: "From the user perspective, I found out that the following allows me to use the directory I choose: select "Other", choose a directory, then switch to "File System" in the drop-down and switch back to the chosen directory again." and it seems to work!
[21:20] <dr_willis> utorrent does exist for linux.

[21:20] <xangua> there is utorrent server dr_willis
[21:21] <BroUnicorn> dr_willis: Okay, that's good to know. I believe it finished now, however a box popped up that says "The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer."
[21:21] <tomrt> hi, all !
[21:21] <BroUnicorn> (Initialize… ; ignore ; Eject) << Those are the three options provided.
[21:21] <dr_willis> BroUnicorn:  if its done.. time to test it out
[21:22] <tomrt> I'm new to ubuntu, I try it since one week
[21:22] <BroUnicorn> dr_willis: I guess that was just it's way of telling me that there was now an operating system on my flash drive. :P
[21:22] <mbeierl> Ok - How do I share printers in ubuntu now?  I have the check box on the server checked - share printers with other systems.  On the client I have the option show printers shared by other systems checked.  Yet... nothing.  This used to work in 10.04
[21:22] <mbeierl> at 12.04 now
[21:22] <BroUnicorn> I'm going to test it out now.
[21:23] <tomrt> on ubuntu 12.10, it seem lightdm is freezing sometimes
[21:24] <tomrt> juste after login, impossible to move windows
[21:24] <blami> tomrt: or it crashes completely, 50% of my boots end up in console
[21:25] <blami> tomrt: by the chance do you have intel gpu?
[21:25] <ilikepandas_> ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 has major changes in that unity is no more. And graphics changed too
[21:25] <tomrt> no crash, just freeze, the only way to resolve the problem is to restart lightdm
[21:25] <tomrt> with "sudo restart lightdm"
[21:26] <KI4RO> mbeierl, Did you share them in CUPS?
[21:26] <orbitwhite> someone please kill me, i'm missing for classic interface i got used to =)
[21:26] <blami> ilikepandas_: I blame intel driver rather than xorg or unity
[21:26] <tomrt> I'm on an intel Core i7, is this a usual problem ?
[21:27] <blami> ilikepandas_: I had to disable intel_iommu and txt extension completely
[21:27] <tomrt> blami : I'm on an intel Core i7, is this a usual problem ?
[21:27] <BroUnicorn> dr_willis: Well, it definitely didn't work. I believe I messed up the usb when I used ctrl-c, as now it tells me the disk is unreadable every time I plug it in.
[21:27] <BroUnicorn> dr_willis: How do I go about cleaning it off?
[21:28] <BroUnicorn> dr_willis: OR could this also be due to having a file that is Ubuntu.img.dmg?
[21:28] <dr_willis> BroUnicorn:  No idea.  I dont use OSX.  i would think the tool would look for the right file name
[21:29] <mbeierl> KI4RO: Share them on the server or do something on the client?  I haven't changed the server
[21:30] <mbeierl> KI4RO: the check box on the server says to share printers, and the printer itself has a check box saying share this printer
[21:30] <dcope> anyone using SnapRAID?
[21:31] <mbeierl> KI4RO: Basically, following this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu
[21:31] <BroUnicorn> Does anyone know how I can completely clean a usb to factory?
[21:31] <mbeierl> BroUnicorn: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX where X is the if of the usb once mounted?
[21:32] <BroUnicorn> the if?
[21:32] <usr13> BroUnicorn: The device name
[21:32] <hilo> good afternoon Ubuntu
[21:32] <mbeierl> BroUnicorn: if = the input source.  in this case a pseudo device that emits all zeros
=== bearovercloud_ is now known as bearovercloud
[21:33] <usr13> mbeierl: Just a reformat would do, wouldn't it?
[21:33] <dr_willis> BroUnicorn:  is on OX-S so i dont know the right dev names.  on it
[21:33] <BroUnicorn> Then I totally messed up as I actually typed "if=" when running the dd command originally to put it on my usb
[21:33] <t4b__> BroUnicorn, think of "if" as input file, I think that's what it means and it makes sense :-)
[21:33] <BroUnicorn> lol
[21:34] <mbeierl> usr13: yes, but that is typically a quick format.  If one wants all the data erased so that it is filled with zeros and not recoverable....
[21:34] <hilo> I have a server running ubuntu 10.04. The swapiness is set to 1. The machine is still swapping. Currently, there is over half the physical ram completely unused, but the system swapped almost a gig. What's going on here???

[21:36] <tomrt> blami : thanks for your help, finally found out many other having the same problem on a Intel i7 on Ivy bridge and ubuntu 12.10
[21:36] <tomrt> I'll try 12.04
[21:36] <hilo> feeshon, not sure how
[21:37] <BroUnicorn> mbeierl: I'm attempting to restore it to how it was before I attempted to put Ubuntu on it so that I can try to put ubuntu on it again
[21:37] <blami> tomrt: I am on i5 Ivy Bridge as well

[21:44] <deitarion> Can anyone recommend a tool for blinking my Scroll Lock LED to indicate something like new mail? Ubuntu no longer provides packages for "blinkd" or "ledcontrol", I'm not sure if they ever provided "mailleds", and I don't want to waste CPU with constant fork()ing by using (while true; do xset led named "Scroll Lock"; sleep 0.4; xset -led named "Scroll Lock"; sleep 0.4; done)
[21:44] <tomrt> blami : maybe one solution -> edit /etc/init/lightdm.conf and copy "sleep 2" just before "exec lightdm"
[21:46] <koumi> hey some times when I suspend Ubuntu it crashes and the image stays still  does it happen also to you guys
[21:47] <kmicu> Anyone have patch for current compiz grid behavior described here https://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz-plugins-main/+bug/878820
[21:47] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 878820 in compiz-plugins-main (Ubuntu) "Window Management, Keyboard shortcut - The grid keybindings are behaving inconsistently" [High,Triaged]
[21:47] <BroUnicorn> Would someone mind walking me through the steps of making my usb a boot drive?
[21:47] <BroUnicorn> I managed to clean it off
[21:47] <kmicu> Or maybe some windows manager where I can divide windows by 2/3 and 1/3 ;]?
[21:47] <orudie> I remember a long time ago a rotating cube for ubuntu was called compiz-fusion or something like that. is that still around ?
[21:48] <usr13> BroUnicorn: So you want to install Ubuntu on a USB flash drive.  Right?
[21:48] <thec4ke> compiz doesnt work with unity
[21:48] <BroUnicorn> usr13: Yes. This is correct.
[21:48] <BroUnicorn> usr13: :D
[21:48] <orudie> I really do not like unity
[21:48] <deitarion> thec4ke: Really? Did 12.10 replace Compiz with something else? I know 12.04 uses Compiz to provide the compositing for Unity.
[21:48] <ero-jiji> is it possible to share a folder in my /home folder with another user? say my user account is "desktop" and i want to share /home/ftp with user account "test"
[21:48] <orudie> is there a way to completely turn off unity, and what are the drawbacks of turning it off ?
[21:49] <thec4ke> orudie: give mint a try
[21:49] <thec4ke> its basically ubuntu with a normal desktop
[21:49] <deitarion> orudie: You don't need Mint to use Compiz.
[21:49] <orudie> what is mint ?
[21:49] <designbybeck____> CTRL + ALT + L to lock the screen... is there another keystroke or is there another one?
[21:49] <designbybeck____> or another way?
[21:49] <usr13> BroUnicorn: It's the same process, you just choose the USB drive as target.
[21:50] <deitarion> orudie: It's another Linux distro (based on Ubuntu) which, apparently, is so primitive that you have to reinstall to upgrade to each new release.
[21:50] <BroUnicorn> usr13: I'm not sure what you mean..
[21:50] <kmicu> thec4ke: deitarion I have compiz with unity @ 12.10 with retarded grid plugin...
[21:50] <BroUnicorn> usr13: I should follow the same instructions I was following?
[21:50] <BroUnicorn> usr13: I don't know what to do differently.
[21:50] <thec4ke> www.linuxmint.com/
[21:50] <usr13> BroUnicorn: And in the end you tell it to write grub to the USB drive.
[21:50] <orudie> why do I need mint ?
[21:50] <orudie> Can't I just disable unity ?
[21:50] <deitarion> kmicu: In other words, Compiz works with Unity... just not necessarily every Compiz plugin.
[21:50] <BroUnicorn> usr13: To write "grub"?
[21:50] <deitarion> orudie: Of course. What desktop do you want?
[21:50] <thec4ke> if you just want compiz lubuntu and xubuntu support it iirc
[21:51] <usr13> BroUnicorn: Yes, grub.  (grub is the boot loader).
[21:51] <orbitwhite> i run mate on 12.10
[21:51] <kmicu> deitarion: grid works, but devs are hibernated https://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz-plugins-main/+bug/878820
[21:51] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 878820 in compiz-plugins-main (Ubuntu) "Window Management, Keyboard shortcut - The grid keybindings are behaving inconsistently" [High,Triaged]
[21:51] <BroUnicorn> usr13: Okay. How would I go about doing that?
[21:51] <thec4ke> pretty sure anything besides mutter will break anything gnome 3 based
[21:51] <BroUnicorn> usr13: All I know how to do is follow the directions ubuntu provides.
[21:51] <thec4ke> ie unity
[21:51] <deitarion> orudie: My brother ditched Unity simply by running `sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop` and then picking Lubuntu at the login screen.
[21:51] <orudie> damn. I am really not familiar with using linux desktop. So i am not even familiar with what is lubuntu or xubuntu
[21:52] <ero-jiji> is it possible to share a folder in my /home folder with another user? say my user account is "desktop" and i want to share /home/ftp with user account "test"
[21:52] <thec4ke> its ubuntu with a different desktop environment
[21:52] <deitarion> orudie: Ok, why don't I give you a quick intro to it, then.
[21:52] <usr13> BroUnicorn: I'm not sure what else to tell you. If you have a specific question, ask and I'll do my best to answer.
[21:52] <thec4ke> xubuntu = xfce desktop, lubuntu = lxde desktop
[21:52] <thec4ke> i personally prefer lxde, others will like xfce
[21:52] <thec4ke> theres tons of desktop environments in linux, you can choose whichever suits you best
[21:52] <deitarion> orudie: Basically, on Linux, everything is built from bits and pieces you can mix-and-match. "Lubuntu" and "Xubuntu" are Ubuntu with a different set of bits and pieces installed by default.
[21:53] <BroUnicorn> usr13: In step 8 on page http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx I'm unsure what to put in place of the if and of
[21:53] <kmicu> Really? Everyone here manage them windows placement with mouse? x]
[21:53] <usr13> BroUnicorn: Oh, I don't know any thing about a mac.  Sorry.
[21:53] <deitarion> kmicu: One sec while I find what you're responding to before I reply.
[21:53] <orudie> so whats ubuntu 12.04 installed with by default ?
[21:53] <BroUnicorn> usr13: Okay haha. thanks anyhow
[21:53] <thec4ke> orudie: unity
[21:54] <thec4ke> thats what you have now :p
[21:54] <usr13> BroUnicorn: You'll have to ask someone that is experiended with mac
[21:54] <orudie> ok I've heard of unity
[21:54] <orudie> what is gnome ?
[21:54] <orudie> and what is X?
[21:54] <thec4ke> gnome is what unity is based off o
[21:54] <BroUnicorn> Can anyone here help me make a usb boot loader from a mac?
[21:54] <thec4ke> basically its ubuntu's extensions to gnome 3
[21:54] <deitarion> kmicu: I think I might have the perfect solution for you.
[21:54] <BroUnicorn> *bootable usb
[21:54] <usr13> orudie: gnome is a Desktop Environment
[21:54] <usr13> orudie: X is the X-server (GUI engine)
[21:54] <thec4ke> X is a basic set of tools for creating and running desktop environments
[21:55] <deitarion> kmicu: I wrote a little tool called QuickTile which gives tiling keybindings which cycle through different widths and use, by default, a grid with three columns and two rows.
[21:55] <thec4ke> basically all desktop environments in linux run over X
[21:55] <orudie> so if I type "startx" I am starting what? gnome ?
[21:55] <thec4ke> youre running whatever your system is set to run by default
[21:55] <deitarion> orudie: "startx" means "Start a GUI". What it launches depends on how your system is set up.
[21:55] <thec4ke> ubuntu runs a display manager
[21:55] <thec4ke> then runs unity
[21:55] <kmicu> deitarion: real keyboard driven windows manager! ;] please share
[21:55] <thec4ke> the display manager just deals with logging in and out
[21:56] <usr13> orudie: X  is a network transparent window system
[21:56] <deitarion> kmicu: It's actually an addon for existing WMs. If you want a full replacement window manager, then look into AwesomeWM, Bluetile, or Xmonad.
[21:56] <deitarion> kmicu: http://ssokolow.com/quicktile/
[21:56] <thec4ke> basically if you want unity to go away you need to install a different desktop environment
[21:56] <thec4ke> lxde and xfce are good options for ubuntu
[21:57] <deitarion> kmicu: Using QuickTile, you'd just turn off the tiling plugin or unbind its keys and let QuickTile handle the keybindings.
[21:57] <kmicu> deitarion: no whole window manager, but placement manager
[21:57] <thec4ke> mint offers mate and cinnamon which are imo the best two DEs atm, which is why i recommended mint
[21:57] <thec4ke> i think you can get packages for them for ubuntu but they arent officially supported
[21:57] <kmicu> "for people who don't want to use the Compiz Grid plugin"
[21:57] <deitarion> kmicu: So QuickTile will probably do what you want then. It just handles moving and resizing windows in response to keybindings, leaving your regular WM in place.
[21:57] <kmicu> I love it
[21:58] <kmicu> deitarion: THX
[21:58] <deitarion> kmicu: No problem. The docs aren't Ubuntu-specific, so let me tell you exactly what to apt-get.
[21:59] <orudie> so there is gnome3 (unity), and compiz is what /
[21:59] <orudie> ?
[21:59] <BroUnicorn> I don't know what to put in for my if and of when attempting this sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m
[21:59] <kmicu> "Just unpack and run. No installation necessary." ;)
[21:59] <BroUnicorn> I'm trying to make a bootable usb
[21:59] <deitarion> kmicu: You still need the libraries it depends on, though.
[21:59] <kmicu> all deps ok
[22:00] <usr13> orudie: startx will initialize an X session.  The startx script that starts the X Window System.
[22:00] <voltagex> how can I get verbose log output from modem-manager?
[22:00] <BroUnicorn> What do I put in place of the if and of? I'm on a mac. I'd really appreciate some help
[22:00] <thec4ke> compiz is a "window manager"
[22:00] <thec4ke> its what draws the windows
[22:00] <thec4ke> decides what they look like and how they behave
[22:01] <thec4ke> combining the window manager with the desktop programs (start menu, task bar, etc) make the desktop environment
[22:01] <thec4ke> for instance gnome/unity uses "mutter" as a wm
[22:01] <thec4ke> that with the programs on the desktop, ie the "launcher" make the DE
[22:02] <deitarion> kmicu: Just in case, QuickTile will start without python-xlib or dbus-python, it'll just be missing features.
[22:02] <thec4ke> in the past and still in some DEs you could change the WM in DE to something else entirely
[22:02] <thec4ke> like in gnome2, the default wm was metacity
[22:02] <thec4ke> and you could change it to compiz if you wanted all the effect
[22:02] <kmicu> deitarion: I read "Usage" but what is binding for tile left 2/3 :)
[22:02] <thec4ke> with gnome3 using any other wm besides mutter will probably break it
[22:02] <kmicu> 1 to 9 is regions, but what is whole left/right side?
[22:03] <deitarion> kmicu: Pressing a binding repeatedly cycles through different proportions.
[22:03] <thec4ke> xfce, lxde, and mate will probably let you use whatever wm you want
[22:03] <kmicu> deitarion: but only in region?
[22:03] <kmicu> and we have 9 regions
[22:03] <slowwritespeed> Is it possible to install ubuntu to USB? not liveUSB.. or boot drive.. but like as both where ubuntu is installed and my primary means of storage (yes, I know it'll be slow)
[22:03] <deitarion> kmicu: I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "only in region"... and could we go to PMs to avoid cluttering the channel?
[22:03] <kmicu> I want whole 1,2,3 :)
[22:04] <slowwritespeed> and if so .. how?
[22:04] <usr13> slowwritespeed: Yes
[22:04] <usr13> slowwritespeed: Same process, just that you choose the USB device as target.
[22:04] <OerHeks> slowwritespeed, just choose your usb device as target to install, it must be 5 Gb +
[22:04] <thec4ke> slowwritespeed: look up "persistent storage" in regards to pen drive linux
[22:04] <deitarion> kmicu: Could we go to PM before I ask for clarification?
[22:05] <slowwritespeed> I've a 32GB SD card.
[22:05] <usr13> slowwritespeed: And in the end, tell it to write the grub boot loader to the USB device
[22:05] <fetzbeast> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZrBRQn6K0A
[22:06] <deitarion> slowwritespeed: The main question is whether your motherboard knows how to boot off an SD card. If it does, just install onto the SD card as if it were a regular hard drive. IF not, you have to install the OS to the SD card and GRUB to something the motherboard DOES know how to boot off of.
[22:06] <Caz> Hi there
[22:06] <usr13> deitarion: Good point.
[22:07] <deitarion> slowwritespeed: Just make sure you DON'T create a swap partition or you'll wear out your SD card REALLY fast.
[22:10] <BroUnicorn> SO I did everything exactly like it said on here http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx. However upon step 8 completing a text box pops up that says the disk I inserted is unreadable by the computer.

[22:20] <nisio> have u tried updating the wifi drivers for ubuntu
[22:20] <usr13> danme: ifconfig  #See what IP you have.
[22:20] <danme> usr13: it is connecting to the wifi but wont reach the Net
[22:20] <usr13> danme: Tell us....
[22:21] <usr13> danme: inet addr: ______________?
[22:21] <danme> this happened since when i have changed the wifi router. but windows CAN connect so i wonder whats wrong.....
[22:21] <usr13> danme: .... for the wireless device.  (Maybe wlan0?)
[22:21] <danme> *CAN reach the internet
[22:22] <usr13> danme: Are you getting an IP?  If so, what IP do you get?
[22:22] <F3Speech> danme: have u tried rebooting your router?
[22:22] <nisio> this happened to me but the oppisite way round , and when I updated my drivers it worked
[22:22] <danme> usr13, i will come back immediately, i need to use another laptop because i have to restart this laptop to check ubuntu
[22:22] <danme> F3Speech: yes

[22:24] <BluesKaj> no need for capitals
[22:24] <nisio> same laptop?

[22:25] <danme> different laptops as wel
[22:25] <danme> *well
[22:25] <danme> ok
[22:25] <danme> wait
[22:25] <danme> thanks
[22:25] <Hexch> as usr13 mention then change it under /etc/resol.conf
[22:25] <usr13> danme: See that the IP you get is in the subnet that the router uses.  For instance, if the router is 192.168.1.1  you should be getting an IP of 192.168.1.xxx  (where xxx is a number between 2 and 254)
[22:26] <nisio> did it work?
[22:26] <usr13> danme: See if you can ping the router.  ping -c3 192.168.1.1
[22:26] <danme> ok. sorry people just wait i preparing the laptops
[22:26] <danme> *im
[22:27] <usr13> danme: See if you can resolve domain name:  host av.com   #If you can not resolve domain name, look at /etc/resolv.conf for [valid] nameserver
[22:27] <mtu> hiyas. i have a strange problem regarding acpi. something that's _not_ acpid is catching a button event and doing something it shouldn't. if i stop acpid and press the wireless button, it still turns off the wireless, but it shouldn't.
[22:28] <danme> but why this is happening only with linux? (fedora and ubuntu) Windows works good on both laptops (windows 7 and 8)
[22:28] <usr13> danme: We don't know.
[22:28] <Hexch> danme: the real question what you did under installation.
[22:28] <nisio> have you got a password set up for your router
[22:28] <danme> i just installed as normal of course
[22:28] <mtu> any idea what service/daemon could be catching the wireless button acpi event and doing stuff, that's _not_ acpid?
[22:29] <Hexch> danme: can you try what usr13 were pointing out?
[22:29] <danme> yes i will try now
=== ducktator is now known as cakeboss
[22:29] <Hexch> gr8
[22:30] <usr13> danme: It is more than likely a nameserver issue.  It is possible that the new modem/ap is giving out bogus IP info.  If that is the case, you should be able edit the modem/ap's configs and change it so that it uses proper nameserver.
[22:30] <danme> need to installed mirc on other laptop first :)
[22:30] <danme> thx :)
[22:30] <hje841> will this result in a new compiler named g++-4.7 along side g++ (version 4.6.3) ? http://askubuntu.com/questions/76885/where-can-i-find-a-g-4-7-package
[22:30] <usr13> danme: mirc?
[22:30] <danme> usr13: but why "bogus"? windows can work with it
[22:31] <danme> usr13: mirc yes. to connect here on irc
[22:31] <danme> i nned to use windows bcos linux wont work
[22:31] <danme> as im saying..
[22:31] <danme> *i need
[22:31] <nisio> drivers. possibly
[22:31] <Hexch> danme: I've seen 100 ubuntu laptop and dosen of windows connecting to an campus wlan, but apple shity devices couldnt
[22:32] <orbitwhite> mtu, so u press hotkey for wireless and it goes on and off?
[22:32] <usr13> danme: Windows may be ignoring the nameserver info.  I don't know. If you tell us what IP information the Windows PC's use and we comapre it to the IP information your Linux PC's use, we could see what the difference is.  Then we could decide if the modem/ap's configuration needs to be fixed or not.
[22:32] <danme> Hexch: well for me is the contrary
[22:32] <Hexch> so you need to focus on your problems insted of symptoms
[22:32] <danme> ok justv wait guys
[22:32] <danme> *just
[22:32] <danme> Hexch 'k
[22:32] <Hexch> :)
[22:32] <mtu> orbitwhite: yes, but acpid is not running. syslog doesn't show what's catching the keypress.
[22:33] <orbitwhite> mtu, anything on dmesg at all related to it pops up?
[22:33] <usr13> danme: You need three things. 1) An IP. 2) A gateway IP, (same as modem/ap).  3) A nameserver, (one that works).
[22:34] <danme> user13: ok wait dude, im almost done
[22:34] <orbitwhite> mtu, could u plz show us ur `rfkill list all` also
[22:34] <orbitwhite> lscpi and laptop model could help too also
[22:35] <wagle> i'm running 10.04 nautilus..  trying to connect to a sambda server..  if i click on the home dir, it autotries to login as the same username and fails..  how do i get it to let me enter username and password?
[22:36] <jhutchins> wagle: I think newer versions handle it better - 10.04 is pretty old.
[22:37] <jhutchins> wagle: We are I think five versions ahead of that now.
[22:37] <univyrse> how do I change to a different DE in 12.10? I can't find any settings and there's no option at the login screen
[22:37] <wagle> i like having a useful gui
[22:37] <usr13> wagle: http://askubuntu.com/questions/50197/cannot-connect-to-samba-share-from-nautilus
[22:37] <jhutchins> univyrse: Do you know which dm you have?  There should be a menu if you have more than one desktop installed, but some of them are very subtle.
[22:38] <jhutchins> wagle: By which you mean to imply that at least one of the current GUIs is crap - with which I agree, but there are good ones available and forks galore.
[22:38] <univyrse> whatever 12.10 installs by default
[22:38] <slowwritespeed> ok.. sorry, quick question: how to format an empty SD card to ext4 in ubuntu?
[22:38] <slowwritespeed> it is fat right now
[22:38] <orbitwhite> wagle, from-under 12.10 i can say that mate de is a compromise for me, give it a try on vm, maybe it will allow u to upgrade =)
[22:39] <jhutchins> univyrse: That's probably gdm, which SHOULD have an option.  (I don't have a test box at hand atm).
[22:39] <stqn> Hi, is there a channel about publishing/developing for the ubuntu software center? And is “Ubuntu Application Development” ( http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=417 ) the appropriate forum? The Community page ( http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/get-help/community/ ) is desperately empty…
[22:39] <jhutchins> univyrse: What alternative desktop do you have?
[22:39] <univyrse> cinnamon
[22:39] <univyrse> installed from the ppa
[22:39] <usr13> slowwritespeed:  mkfs.ext4
[22:39] <jhutchins> univyrse: Have you restarted gdm since?
[22:39] <stqn> univyrse: you can for example sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[22:40] <univyrse> stqn, I'm not trying to install xubuntu
[22:40] <jhutchins> stqn: He's having trouble figuring out how to tell gdm to use a different desktop, and I don't have gdm at hand to tell him.
[22:40] <danme2> usr13: ok here i am. tell me what i need to do
[22:40] <univyrse> I have cinnamon installed, i just don't know how to switch into it from unity
[22:40] <jhutchins> Wait, I can do this...
[22:40] <wagle> jhutchins: its about time for me to try again..  especially since EoL for 10.04 is april or somesuch
[22:40] <usr13> danme2: iwconfig  #See if the essid is correct.
[22:40] <hje841> how do I install g++-4.7 in 12.04 along side the existing 4.6.3? without breaking anything
[22:40] <mtu> orbitwhite: rfkill list all looks like you'd expect on a thinkpad - tp_bluetooth_sw, tpacpi_wwan_sw and phy0 wireless. the key press i'm talking about changes phy0 soft block from no to yes
[22:41] <xangua> univyrse: in the login screen there is an icon next to your username, select it and you'll be able to select the session you want (and it will also set as the default)
[22:41] <danme2> usr13: yes it is correct, im already connected to wifi, ubuntu says.
[22:41] <danme2> just cant reach websites
[22:41] <mtu> orbitwhite: hard block is only active if i turn the hardware switch, obviously. let me check dmesg.
[22:41] <univyrse> there is no icon
[22:41] <wagle> its just that this is everything i want/need, and the new gui was a severe regression
[22:41] <stqn> univyrse: ah, I see… there’s an “ubuntu” icon on the page where you login after boot, click on it…
[22:41] <orbitwhite> mtu, seems like somewhat good start i hope

[22:45] <BroUnicorn> Okay
[22:45] <danme2> usr13: modem is apart from ap. ap gets recognized here as 192.168.1.1
[22:45] <mtu> orbitwhite: dmesg appears to be showing the same stuff as syslog. the only interesting things: "iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: L1 Disabled; Enabling L0S" and "e1000e 0000:00:19.0: irq 45 for MSI/MSI-X". but that doesn't tell me anything about the acpi event.

[22:45] <thec4ke> univyrse: what does ls /usr/share/xsessions say?
[22:45] <danme2> usr13: but i dont know whats the ip of modem
[22:45] <BroUnicorn> How do I install ubuntu using a cd-r
[22:45] <BroUnicorn> and bootcamp
[22:45] <danme2> usr13: no it does not host av.com
[22:45] <univyrse> gnome.desktop ubuntu.desktop
[22:45] <usr13> danme2: Can you ping the modem/ap?    ping -c3 192.168.1.1
[22:45] <jhutchins> uni4dfx: It should be there anyway so you can pick between "Ubuntu" (Unity?), gnome, gnome classic...
[22:46] <univyrse> does that mean cinnamon isnt installed correctly?
[22:46] <jhutchins> univyrse: Drat nick completion....
[22:46] <orbitwhite> mtu what is the laptop model and card?
[22:46] <univyrse> oh
[22:46] <thec4ke> univyrse: you probably need to manually add a session definition
[22:46] <orbitwhite> soz 4 being slow english is not my primary
[22:46] <danme2> usr13: yes i can ping the ap 192.168.1.1
[22:46] <jhutchins> univyrse: Try adding something light like lxde or xfce to see if it shows up.  Could be the ppd packages don't update gdm correctly.
[22:46] <usr13> danme2: cat /etc/resolv.conf   #What do you have as nameserver (IP Address).

[22:52] <g-zus> I'm trying to share my wlan0's network with the local network via eth0/eth1. but somehow, everytime I plug in a cable on eth0, the wireless connection is disconnected (I presume, by network-manager)
[22:52] <ubuntu-tester1> danme2: try 208.67.222.222
[22:52] <g-zus> any idea how to solve this problem?
[22:52] <jhutchins> Miebster_: The vmware packages are distributed by vmware, unless you set up a local repository you need to use theirs.
[22:53] <danme2> usr13: i have three rows here. but the first word under "Gateway" is 192.168.1.1
[22:53] <usr13> danme2: What country are you in?  USA?

[22:53] <danme2> no italy
[22:53] <mladoux> Miebster_, apt-get install vmware-view-client
[22:53] <Miebster_> jhutchins: sorry wrong paste, vmwares website links to http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/vmware-view-client when you try to download it
[22:53] <ubuntu-tester1> g-zus: pastebin tail -50 /var/log/syslog righr after that
[22:53] <usr13> danme2: I see.  Ok. can you ping 208.67.222.222 ?
[22:53] <orbitwhite> mtu, i'm not sure yet if it needs some firmware to be loaded, but are you 100% sure that module doesn't show any signs of erorrous work while everything is ok on rfkill?

[22:59] <univyrse> jhutchins, yes

[23:01] <usr13> danme2: ipconfig /all    #And write down all the IP info.  Gateway, DNS  etc...
[23:01] <mladoux> Miebster_, glad to help
[23:01] <danme2> usr13: i have the ISP's modem, which is only wired. so, i used to have an older ap before that was relaying for me as wifi. but now i have replaced the wifi ap with a wifi modem/router and wont work anything with linux :-/ only windows can make it work
[23:02] <g-zus> ubuntu-tester1: no, the line 11 is when the eth0 got plugged in and dhcp acquired the ip; the line 12 is when I unplugged the cable from eth0
[23:02] <orbitwhite> mtu, it is strange because according to google u're the only person with such problem, if i'm not missing something ofcourse
[23:02] <usr13> danme2: firefox 192.168.1.1
[23:02] <danme2> oh well, my android phone works as well
[23:02] <danme2> usr13 ok wait i try all what u said
[23:03] <orbitwhite> mtu, i can't be precise, but did u touch the driver, i mean did u set it up manually?
[23:03] <shelfries> hi could somebody walk me through partitioning my drive to install windows+
[23:03] <usr13> danme2: If you connect to wired, you may get proper IP info.  But ... well, you can just see what IP info MS Windows gets and duplicate that.
[23:03] <shelfries> ?
[23:03] <danme2> usr13: firefox 192.168.1.1 gives me the new ap login page
[23:03] <usr13> danme2: Login and see how it's configured.
[23:04] <g-zus> ubuntu-tester1: just to clarify even further line 11 refers actually to the wireless disconnection, it happens just after eth0 got plugged and dhclient received a dhcp offer
[23:04] <Miebster_> Unity strikes again.  I can't change VMWare View Client to non full screen because the unity tool bar covers up the window bar with maximize, restore, minimize, and there is no context options. Any ideas?
[23:04] <ubuntu-tester1> g-zus: strange. your eth socket state is somehow connected with the radio killswitch. maybe somw weird option in BIOS?
[23:04] <mtu> orbitwhite: well, it's probably not a common problem to want to stop the wireless soft button from switching the wireless on and off...
[23:04] <mladoux> I've seen that issue with some coffee shop wireless gateways, windows can access, linux can't. Not sure what causes it.
[23:05] <danme3> usr13: firefox 192.168.1.1 gives me ap's login page
[23:05] <g-zus> ubuntu-tester1: yes, that's what it seems :) I don't think there is any BIOS option that I haven't noticed, but I could well look again :)
[23:05] <usr13> danme3: I know.
[23:05] <orbitwhite> mtu, sorry for being useless lol but is it everything ok with button itself? loool
[23:05] <danme3> usr13: ok so what do i need to do?
[23:05] <mtu> orbitwhite: yeah, i'll look elsewhere. thanks anyway. see ya!
[23:05] <usr13> danme3: Login and see how it'
[23:05] <usr13> s set up
[23:06] <ubuntu-tester1> g-zus: also try googling '<model> radio killswitch'
[23:06] <xentity1x> My package system is broken. I tired disabling other software sources and running sudo apt-get install -f, but it didn't fix it. This is what I got http://pastebin.com/UVHCuWC6. Can anyone help?
[23:06] <usr13> danme3: ping -c3 192.168.1.254   #Can you ping that IP?
[23:06] <danme3> usr13: wait i will just pastebin here route -n and windows's ipconfig /all
[23:06] <usr13> danme3: Ok good
[23:07] <ubuntu-tester1> Miebster_: turn launcher auto-hide in sys. settings
[23:07] <danme3> usr13: no i cant ping that
[23:07] <usr13> pastebin windows ipconfig /all
[23:07] <danme3> ok
[23:07] <shelfries> hi could somebody walk me through partitioning my drive to install windows+
[23:08] <usr13> shelfries: to install windows?
[23:08] <usr13> shelfries: MS Windows?
[23:08] <shelfries> yes
[23:08] <usr13> shelfries: The MS Windows installer will do it for you.
[23:09] <usr13> shelfries: Or,   /join #windows
[23:09] <g-zus> ubuntu-tester1: thanks, will try :) going to check the bios. brb.
[23:09] <TimeRider_UK> huh?
[23:10] <shelfries> usr13 it says my hard drive isn't partitioned correctly. and i would but i'm running linux they prolly wouldn't be able to help me partition hard drives when i'm running linux
[23:10] <mladoux> I'd install windows first, then linux after, that way you don't have to deal with the Windows boot loader.
[23:10] <TimeRider_UK> can browse at home bt not coffee shop? static dns set maybe?
[23:10] <TimeRider_UK> fdisk
[23:10] <usr13> shelfries: How can you be running Linux and installing MS Windows at the same time?
[23:10] <TimeRider_UK> sorry, reading back all over
[23:11] <TimeRider_UK> virtualising :)
[23:11] <usr13> shelfries: Are you trying to set up a dual-boot system?
[23:11] <TimeRider_UK> gparted - or parted
[23:11] <TimeRider_UK> or fdisk
[23:11] <ubuntu-tester1> shelfries: are you trying to install windows side-by-side with ubuntu or to a separate physical disk?
[23:12] <shelfries> no not currently. i jacked up my computer pretty nicely when i was attempting to dual boot and ended up with ubuntu installed. i want to get back to windows so i can run ubuntu in a virtual box
[23:12] <xentity1x> My package system is broken. I tired disabling other software sources and running sudo apt-get install -f, but it didn't fix it. This is what I got http://pastebin.com/UVHCuWC6. Can anyone help?
[23:12] <usr13> shelfries: And you have installed Linux first?  If so, did you leave free space at the front of the drive?  Or do you have a second HD?  If not, I suggest you install a second HD.
[23:12] <shelfries> but i can't do that until i get windows back on and i can't get windows back on until the hard drive is partitioned correctly. how do i do that?
[23:12] <shelfries> usr13 how do i do that
[23:13] <jrib> xentity1x: do you have any idea why?  Give background
[23:13] <TimeRider_UK> shellrisk: make do primary partitions, install windows firs, then install ubuntu, you'll get a boot menu to start either then
[23:13] <usr13> shelfries: Are you sure you don't have MS Windows still installed and are just unable to boot to it?  (If that is the case, you should be able to fix that...)
[23:13] <TimeRider_UK> I can't type...
[23:13] <TimeRider_UK> darn
[23:13] <ubuntu-tester1> shelfries: boot from live cd/usb, run gparted, remove all partitions (with ALL your data, beware!), then install win
[23:14] <usr13> shelfries: Actually, your best bet is to just set MS Windows up as the guest OS.  You already have Linux installed, just install vbox and install MS Windows as guest OS.
[23:14] <xentity1x> jrib, I'm not exactly sure. It happened when I installed WINE from the software center. At the bottom of the pastebin it shows the deb files that cause errors while processing.
[23:15] <jrib> xentity1x: why did you mention you disabled software sources?
[23:15] <danme3> usr13: Ok, here's ROUTE -N (UBUNTU) -> http://pastebin.com/n6dDvWdw and here is IPCONFIG /ALL (WINDOWS) -> http://pastebin.com/xq64ufHi
[23:15] <shelfries> usr13 no i'm sure i dont have windows. and i'm confused on the boot part. how do i boot from a live disc and then run gparted?
[23:16] <usr13> shelfries: The package is virtualbox
[23:16] <TimeRider_UK> .. you all gonna confuse him
[23:16] <ubuntu-tester1> !livecd | shelfries
[23:16] <ubottu> shelfries: The Ubuntu Desktop CD is a "LiveCD" which can be run without altering existing files on your harddrive. Especially useful for testing your hardware's compatibility, it also includes an install option.
[23:16] <xentity1x> jrib, I saw an error message that said to try disabling third party repositories and running apt-get install -f.
[23:16] <danme3> usr13: i messaged you
[23:16] <xentity1x> jrib, it did't really seem to help
[23:17] <jrib> xentity1x: pastebin: dpkg -l '*:i386' | grep '^ii'
[23:17] <danme3> usr13: Ok, here's ROUTE -N (UBUNTU) -> http://pastebin.com/n6dDvWdw and here is IPCONFIG /ALL (WINDOWS) -> http://pastebin.com/xq64ufHi
[23:17] <xentity1x> jrib, what does that do?
[23:17] <shelfries> yeah i'm confused.
[23:17] <shelfries> ubottu how do i get that?
[23:17] <ubottu> shelfries: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[23:17] <jrib> xentity1x: it just prints information
[23:17] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : so many ways you can achieve what you want from linux
[23:18] <TimeRider_UK> me thinks you new
[23:18] <shelfries> yeah i'm new to this
[23:18] <shelfries> i need like a step by step of how to do all this
[23:18] <TimeRider_UK> me thinks you should: run gparted - partition your drive... THEN install windows to one partition, then reboot and install Ubuntu to the other
[23:18] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : you've partitioned a drive before?
[23:19] <ubuntu-tester1> shelfries: how did you get your current system's distro
=== thiago is now known as Guest55742
[23:19] <xentity1x> jrib, http://pastebin.com/hX5Npwb4
[23:19] <shelfries> on windows yes. but on linux and gparted it won't let me because its mounted
[23:19] <Nerdshank> anyone good with wireless problems?
[23:19] <shelfries> ubuntu-tester well i had a fiasco and managed to somehow get 12.10 installed. i'm not sure how
[23:20] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : as mentioned above, boot from your install disc.. it wil let you run gparted
[23:20] <usr13> Nerdshank: What do you need?
[23:20] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : I'm assuming it was the ubuntu live install you used
[23:20] <jrib> xentity1x: see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libdrm/+bug/1068165
[23:20] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1068165 in libdrm (Ubuntu) "package libdrm2 2.4.39-0ubuntu1 failed to install/upgrade: trying to overwrite shared '/usr/share/doc/libdrm2/changelog.Debian.gz', which is different from other instances of package libdrm2:amd64" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[23:20] <shelfries> i installed 12.10 from a boot disc i created TimeRider_UK
[23:20] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : run gparted now though to familarise yourself and you can ask questions in here.. it's quite straight forwrd
[23:21] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : 12.10 shoul give you a desktop with option to simply run, OR install.... simply run/test
[23:21] <TimeRider_UK> Where are you in the world Shel?
[23:21] <Nerdshank> usr13: got atheroes AR9485 wireless card, really bad connectivity and random timeouts freeze up pc too sometimes
[23:21] <shelfries> i'm a student, and its installed
[23:21] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : but you have the disc?
[23:21] <usr13> Nerdshank: iwconfig  | pastebinit   #Let's have a look at connection info.
[23:22] <TimeRider_UK> sel the cd/dvd?
[23:22] <xentity1x> jrib, how can you tell from what i just showed you?
[23:22] <Nerdshank> usr13, i know this was a know bug for this card but havent found solution
[23:22] <jrib> xentity1x: it was unrelated, I stumbled upon the bug while waiting for you to pastebin
[23:22] <jrib> xentity1x: there's a workaround in the comments
[23:22] <usr13> Nerdshank: What version of Ubuntu?
[23:22] <shelfries> yes i have the disk, so boot it and i can just run it and partition the system?
[23:22] <xentity1x> jrib, thanks
[23:23] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : yes you can
[23:24] <Nerdshank> usr13, atm 11.10 - was on 12.04 this is where the problem laid, not sure if 11 does it too this is a fresh install
[23:24] <shelfries> ok so when i do that how do i partition the hard drive and where do i go from there?
[23:24] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : I'd suggest erase all partitions, then create 2 primary ones
[23:24] <ubuntu-tester1> danme3: seems like your wireless connection is up. bring it down, bring eth up, record ifconfig and route -n, pastebin
[23:24] <BroUnicorn> Hey
[23:24] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : that way you can choose your OS as familiarise yourself with Linux/Ubuntu
[23:24] <BroUnicorn> So I changed over to windows
=== F3Speech is now known as F3Away
[23:25] <Nerdshank> usr13, but so far its not as bad
[23:25] <shelfries> TimeRider_UK so i have a 500 gb hard drive. for the two partitions should i just do half and half?
[23:25] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : Install Windows first, then install linux to the second partition, Ubuntu will realise windows in present and give you an option on boot
[23:25] <usr13> Nerdshank: iwconfig  | pastebinit   #Let's have a look at connection info.
[23:25] <BroUnicorn> I'm running the universal usb pendrive installer. However when locating the iso file that is on my desktop the iso file doesn't show up..
[23:26] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : half and half is fine, it'll do for you for now, you may decide later to have more (or less) space for either OS... Depends on what you want to use it for... go 50/50 for now though :)
[23:26] <TimeRider_UK> .. I smell coffee... but I don't have coffee machine on... hmmmmmm
[23:26] <ubuntu-tester1> BroUnicorn: are you in win now?
[23:26] <Nerdshank> usr13, no extensions returned
[23:26] <BroUnicorn> usr13 I moved my iso file over to windows.
[23:26] <usr13> Nerdshank: So, it's not working at all then?
[23:26] <BroUnicorn> Sorry, not trying to interrupt. Accidentally hit enter
[23:26] <shelfries> TimeRider_UK ok so when i do the partitions in linux, i shut down, insert windows cd/usb and install it?
[23:26] <DaemonicApathy> BroUnicorn: Did you put it on the correct Desktop?
[23:26] <usr13> BroUnicorn: Thats' ok.
=== F3Away is now known as F3Speech
[23:27] <Nerdshank> no its working very intermittently
[23:27] <BroUnicorn> Yes. It's on my Windows desktop. I run the pendrive installer and select ubuntu, then attempt to find the iso file on my desktop. Yet, it isn't there.
[23:27] <ubuntu-tester1> BroUnicorn: what's exact iso filename?
[23:27] <d4rkwizz4rd> hi people
[23:28] <usr13> Nerdshank: You don't see  wlan0  ?
[23:28] <Nerdshank> usr13, maybe its just a 12.04 issue?
[23:28] <Nerdshank> usr13, no not
[23:28] <BroUnicorn> ubuntu-12-1.10-desktop-i386
[23:28] <usr13> Nerdshank: Should work on either one.
[23:28] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : yes.. partition using your ubuntu disc.. shutdown, instal windows to first partition, shutdown, install ubuntu to second partition.. reboot and play :)
[23:28] <Nerdshank> usr13, sec just ran it again it showed
[23:28] <ero-jiji> is it possible to share a folder in my /home folder with another user? say my user account is "desktop" and i want to share /home/ftp with user account "test"
[23:29] <shelfries> TimeRider_UK ok so what type of partitions do these need to be? NTFS?
[23:29] <ubuntu-tester1> BroUnicorn: looks like wrong name.
[23:29] <shelfries> do i need to change anything in the bios?
[23:29] <DaemonicApathy> shelfries: Have you been through the installer yet?
[23:29] <BroUnicorn> ubuntu-tester1 Does the name have to be exact?
[23:30] <shelfries> and then how will it know to install to the right partition?
[23:30] <TimeRider_UK> I'd leave em blank and let the OS choose it's default
[23:30] <Nerdshank> usr13, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1535959/
[23:30] <shelfries> just leave them as unallocated space then right?
[23:30] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries windows will ask you, as will Ubuntu
[23:30] <BroUnicorn> That was the issue.
[23:30] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : so yes leave em blank, but TWO partitions
[23:30] <BroUnicorn> Thank you very much.
[23:30] <ubuntu-tester1> yes, installer only shows iso files that  match target system/arch
[23:31] <shelfries> and both primary. ok i'll try that then
[23:31] <shelfries> Thanks
[23:31] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : you're welcome, you have another computer so you can get back in here if you get stuck?
[23:31] <Nerdshank> usr13, idk seems to be ok in 11 im think its just an issue with 12
[23:31] <Danawar3> Hey #ubuntu my ubuntu machine is running rather slow and at times when i try to use it, it just locks up what would the reason be for this or how can i troubleshoot it?
[23:32] <usr13> Nerdshank: Link Quality=48/70  Signal level=-62 dBm   (Doesn't look good..)  Weak signal.
[23:32] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : and don't worry about the confusion earlier, pretty much everyone WAS right, just so many different ways of achieving a similar goal
[23:32] <ero-jiji> is it possible to share a folder in my /home folder with another user? say my user account is "desktop" and i want to share /home/ftp with user account "test" (its not possible for me to move the folder)
[23:32] <shelfries> TimeRider_UK yeah i do. and alright sounds good
[23:32] <BroUnicorn> When this program turns the usb into a ubuntu pendrive will I be able to boot on my Mac?
[23:32] <usr13> Nerdshank: Can you improve your location?  (Or the router's location?  Maybe a higher shelf?)
[23:32] <Nerdshank> usr13, ya thats one of the problems i get even sitting only 2 feet from route
[23:33] <TimeRider_UK> shelfries : Have fun, you stick at playing with linux, you gonna love it... I've not looked back in YEARS :)
[23:33] <usr13> Nerdshank: Ok, not good.
[23:33] <usr13> Nerdshank: I see:   http://askubuntu.com/questions/121487/atheros-ar9485-wireless-card-doesnt-work-in-an-asus-k53e
[23:33] <DaemonicApathy> ero-jiji: GUI or CLI?
[23:33] <TimeRider_UK> .. anyone got any cigarette papers I can have?
[23:33] <univyrse> i remember the night I switched to linux
[23:33] <usr13> Nerdshank: And for 12.04 I see:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1983003
[23:34] <TimeRider_UK> univyrse : how long ago?
[23:34] <ero-jiji> DaemonicApathy GUI via x2go
[23:34] <usr13> Nerdshank: Fully updated?   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[23:34] <TimeRider_UK> My first UNIX experience was like 22 years ago.. eek!
[23:34] <univyrse> i thought I could switch back, so I just stuck with linux. I miss playing video games a lot, but this year will be great with gaben and steam
[23:34] <univyrse> TimeRider_UK, around 10.04 was released
[23:34] <univyrse> whenever that was
[23:34] <DaemonicApathy> ero-jiji: You don't have local access?
[23:35] <TimeRider_UK> univyrse : Yeah, but hey.. Wine if set up right will play TF2 etc BETTER than windoze!
[23:35] <Nerdshank> usr13, yes its updated lol i laided it on top of router and only getting 59/70
[23:35] <BroUnicorn> I'm excited for this to install. I'm a computer science major at UT Knoxville. I went into one of the labs for the first time the other day... every single lab computer has ubuntu installed. First time I'd ever seen it, and I was completely convinced to switch.
[23:35] <TimeRider_UK> univyrse : Thing OI love with Linux... it's so open source, there literally is NO limit to what you really can do
[23:35] <Perfie> LOL
[23:35] <univyrse> I hate wine
[23:35] <ero-jiji> dae its a remote server that i was using as a backup ftp target, the original ftp root was put in /home/ftp of the main dir. and the way it was partitioned all the space was put into /home
[23:35] <Perfie> univyrse, wine hates you
[23:35] <univyrse> I would rather devs make linux games
[23:35] <BroUnicorn> Now I do have a question... since I'm putting ubuntu on a pen drive.. I won't be able to save any programs on it would I?
[23:36] <usr13> Nerdshank: Not good.  I dono.  Maybe you need another wireless card?
[23:36] <ero-jiji> DaemonicApathy its a remote server that i was using as a backup ftp target, the original ftp root was put in /home/ftp of the main dir. and the way it was partitioned all the space was put into /home
[23:36] <Perfie> and besides, only old farts and wanna bee classy people drink wine
[23:36] <Perfie> but that ain't classy
[23:36] <TimeRider_UK> univyrse : hell yeah, that's the way it should be, crumbs, we have compilers here for everything.. if the company has source... make...

[23:36] <TimeRider_UK> Perfie : wanna call around for a drop?
[23:36] <DaemonicApathy> ero-jiji: "Dae" is fine if you like, I'm paying attention. ;-) If there is no sharing option upon right clicking the folder, I'll leave this to someone else.
[23:36] <IdleOne> Perfie: please stop ban evading. part this channel now.
[23:37] <Perfie> looooool
[23:37] <ero-jiji> DaemonicApathy now i need to give a couple users read access to backups on the machine, and i dont want to give them my user acct obviously
[23:37] <Perfie> ban evading?
[23:37] <Perfie> I'm banned?
[23:37] <TimeRider_UK> Perfie : long as you bring some women and some cig papers :)
[23:37] <univyrse> it wont matter after this year, gaben is going to force devs to switch to linux with the new steam, and as long as us linux games buy the linux games, that will be that
[23:37] <Perfie> IdleOne, my ip gave me another chance, you should too ;)
[23:37] <univyrse> ban evasion is gline-worthy
[23:37] <univyrse> talk to #freenode

[23:38] <brady2600> the policies here are nazi level anyhow.
[23:38] <DaemonicApathy> Hardly, brady.
[23:38] <univyrse> brady, freenode policies or channel policies?
[23:38] <TimeRider_UK> brady2600 : they are? where are you? Britain?
[23:38] <ero-jiji> DaemonicApathy theres approx 7tb of backups there now, and no easy way to remove them all, reset up the folders, and reupload

[23:38] <Nerdshank> usr13, if your suggesting bad card i dont believe so, it works well in windows so idk. maybe just not linux friendly
[23:39] <TimeRider_UK> freenode so bad? I never did have a problem
[23:39] <univyrse> can ubottu actually tell if we're offtopic or does someone play puppeteer?
[23:39] <Danawar3> ey Ubuntu my Ubuntu computer has started getting very slow and occasionally locking up where would I be able to troubleshoot this as CPU usage is always around 10-20%
[23:39] <univyrse> I have a feeling it's the latter
[23:39] <k1l> hey guys, would be nice if we can keep this channel clean for the support questions. thanks
[23:39] <Nerdshank> usr13, trying backport update ill let u know how it turns out, thankyou

[23:39] <usr13> Nerdshank: Exactly, not Linux Friendly.  (Linux users are careful to buy Linux Friendly Hardware.)
[23:40] <TimeRider_UK> .. but that's just cos I'm a console dude
[23:40] <univyrse> htop is godly
[23:40] <Danawar3> TimeRider_UK: htop and top seem to show me the same thing  weather the computer is locking up or not
[23:40] <usr13> Nerdshank: Yea, I've given you all the info I have on it.  I just dono.  Maybe someone else will tell you something.
[23:40] <univyrse> i just wish it would save my damn settings between sessions
[23:40] <k1l> Hamtechperson: does that make any difference?
[23:40] <Danawar3> TimeRider_UK: Some times htop shows a process called "visitors" which takes up alot of CPU ussage
[23:40] <TimeRider_UK> Hamtechperson : if I'm reading yo uright.. look in /etc/apt/sources.list
[23:41] <TimeRider_UK> Danawar3 : so look up 'visitors' see what the heck it is!
[23:41] <univyrse> idleone, that is most likely unwise
[23:41] <TimeRider_UK> anyone else got 'visitors' running on their machine?
[23:41] <univyrse> you just banned everyone without an irc client
[23:41] <TimeRider_UK> Danawar3 : or kill it and see what happens
[23:43] <ero-jiji> is it possible to share a folder in my /home folder with another user? say my user account is "desktop" and i want to share /home/ftp with user account "test" (its not possible for me to move the folder and theres no share option in right click menu)
[23:43] <TimeRider_UK> wow, everyone is gone!
[23:43] <univyrse> man oh man, super goof has been enabled in this channel
[23:43] <matti_> (waving)
[23:43] <Hamtechperson> super goof?
[23:43] <univyrse> yeah, it's way worse than a regular goof
[23:43] <k1l> univyrse: do you have something usefull to say? please keep this channel free for support. thank you
[23:44] <TimeRider_UK> Hamtechperson : yeah, apt-get install super-goof
[23:44] <DX099_live> hello
[23:44] <TimeRider_UK> though it looks like it's running as a cron job, lol
[23:44] <univyrse> k1l, are you implying that I am less than useful because I would find such an implication highly derogatory and hurtful
[23:44] <brady2600> notice how quickly they will ban people here for tiny infractions to pointless policies, yet they don't seem to spend much time caring about people asking questions most of the time.
[23:45] <orbitwhite> true
[23:45] <Hamtechperson> I'd need sudo for that, right?
[23:45] <univyrse> brady do you have something useful to say? please keep this channel free for support. thank you

[23:45] <usr13> brady2600: This is a busy chanel.
[23:45] <TimeRider_UK> brady2600 : agree...  I idle in here much, but tonight have answered, and hopefully helped several people... I await my ban
[23:45] <jarlath> Anyone recommend or warn against amd-driver-installer-12.6-legacy-x86.x86_64.run ?
[23:45] <Hamtechperson> Also, now that I'm into sources.list, what should I do?
[23:45] <DX099_live> I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 on a  new computer that has an "AMD FX(tm)-6100 Six-Core Processor"
[23:45] <orbitwhite> ban plz
=== MartinS is now known as Guest90117
[23:45] <DX099_live> was I right to choose amd64 image ?
[23:45] <TimeRider_UK> Hamtechperson : edit the Http to http
[23:46] <TimeRider_UK> Hamtechperson : then save
[23:46] <Jeruvy> DX099_live yes.
[23:46] <TimeRider_UK> Hamtechperson : if that doesn't help, then I didn't understand the question that you didn't ask correctly :p
[23:46] <Hamtechperson> It opened read only. But it helps.
[23:46] <synapsxyz> c
[23:46] <orbitwhite> wow never thought Http and http plays role
[23:46] <tekk> hi guys, i wanna try out the bond0 interface.. i live in a remote region with poor adsl, however i have 4 3G modems, all that i can connect to via WiFi
[23:46] <TimeRider_UK> Hamtechperson : drop to root console and edit in there
[23:47] <ikonia> tekk: I'd not advise you to try two networks like that for bonding
[23:47] <tekk> the question is… does wpa_supplicant on a single system, support the connection/authentication of 4+ simultaneous wifi connections?
[23:47] <k1l> TimeRider_UK: no need for root console. we have sudo to to this
[23:47] <DX099_live> Jeruvy, ok. Now I have a 60 gig SSD. Windows is already taking ~25 Go
[23:47] <Hamtechperson> Root console? (Sorry if that seems stupid, but I'm new)
[23:47] <TimeRider_UK> orbitwhite : upper and lower case matter a lot...
[23:47] <tekk> ikonia, how come?
[23:47] <ikonia> tekk: bonding isn't meant for that sort of thing
[23:47] <synapsxyz> ok
[23:47] <DX099_live> To avoid any space conflict how should I install ubuntu on it ?
[23:47] <tekk> i basically wanna broadcast a single wifi network for my family that has several backbones
[23:47] <tekk> roundrobin style
[23:47] <k1l> Hamtechperson: use "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"
[23:47] <tekk> ikonia, but it would work right?
[23:47] <ikonia> tekk: you'd need very complex routing
[23:47] <TimeRider_UK> k1l : he's still gonna have to drop to console, no sudo for gui for him?
[23:48] <Jeruvy> DX099_live Windows 7 or 8?  I would use a 60GB drive strickly for windows.  You could partition 20GB for Ubuntu
[23:48] <ikonia> tekk: no, it wouldn't as I suspect your routing would not be good enough
[23:48] <DX099_live> Jeruvy, Windows 8
[23:48] <tekk> why? i thought that for example if i had 4 separate connections to 4 seperate websites, the bond0 interface would handle it if the correct bonding option was chosen?
[23:48] <TimeRider_UK> k1l : cos nano is orrible! :p
[23:48] <ikonia> tekk: the technical concept you suggest would work, the practicality of a working solution, wouldn't
[23:48] <Jeruvy> DX099_live 60GB is recommended for 8, so I'd consider another drive, or like I stated above.
[23:49] <tekk> ikonia, right now i have 1 3G connection broadcasting wifi for 3 people
[23:49] <DaemonicApathy> nano isn't horrible, but one can usually use gksudo nautilus if one preferes. I've seen this cause glitches in the DE occasionally, though.
[23:49] <orbitwhite> tekk, how will be decided which particular website should be routed through certain device
[23:49] <tekk> several separate 3g connections over a single wifi would be better for my use case
[23:49] <ikonia> tekk: I'm sorry that wouldn't work
[23:49] <DX099_live> DX099_live, so I may take 20 Go for Ubuntu on the SSD (of course, home will be on another partition) ?
[23:49] <komputes> orbitwhite: heh adblock plus auto-corrected Http for me
[23:49] <ikonia> tekk: while as a concept it is acceptable, as a solution it's not
[23:49] <tekk> orbitwhite, the bond0 interface supports several options, one is simple roundrobin
[23:49] <TimeRider_UK> DaemonicApathy : handy tip there :) I play console 99% of time so bit behind on the gui
[23:49] <aeon-ltd> :q
[23:50] <ero-jiji> is it possible to share a folder in my /home folder with another user? say my user account is "desktop" and i want to share /home/ftp with user account "test" (its not possible for me to move the folder and theres no share option in right click menu)
[23:50] <tekk> hmm… can you suggest anything else ikonia? as i know vendors who ship expensive 3g dongle bonding solutions
[23:50] <ikonia> tekk: I'm sorry, but my view of that problem and it's solution requires enterprise hardware
[23:50] <stqn> bye
[23:50] <matti_> Ubuntu 12.10 on a tablet - any info on implementing auto-rotate screen and on-screen keyboard auto-popup?
[23:50] <Jeruvy> DX099_live, that should work for a while.
[23:51] <tekk> maybe i should code a simple socks proxy as a workaround for now
[23:51] <univyrse> i cant wait to write mobile apps in something other than java and objc
[23:51] <tekk> that round robin's 4 interfaces
[23:51] <DX099_live> Jeruvy, Meaning 12 Gb left for Windows isn't enough ?
[23:51] <univyrse> ubuntu phone is going to be the shiiiiiiiiiit
[23:51] <tekk> but exposes just a socks proxy to the client over a LAN ip
[23:51] <ikonia> tekk: it's not as simple as just round robbin
[23:51] <Jeruvy> ikonia, you could do that with a sony eriksson MD400 for example on a desktop.
[23:51] <TimeRider_UK> DX099_live : windows needs lots of space.. lots of memory...
[23:52] <tekk> enlighten me… if an IP connection is given over eth0 to client1 and returned the same route… what could be an issue?
[23:52] <TimeRider_UK> DX099_live inneficient coding
[23:52] <orbitwhite> tekk, ok u got roundrobin what will it solve according to ur plan?
[23:52] <tekk> i understand if its transmitted via eth0 and returned over eth1 for example
[23:52] <Jeruvy> DX099_live if you not going to do a lot with it you should be fine but yes when it says 60GB is recommended you should listen :)
[23:52] <tekk> orbitwhite, it means that my wife can be watching iplayer whilst i play spotify
[23:52] <ubuntu-tester1> ero-jiji: do you want to share via ftp?
[23:52] <ikonia> tekk: a bonded interface is not a physical device oviously, so you are going to have multiple networks routing packets to a single host
[23:52] <Hamtechperson> How do you save in nano?
[23:52] <tekk> both using different backbones
[23:53] <jrib> Hamtechperson: the bottom explains (you want to press ctrl-o)
[23:53] <BroUnicorn> I made my usb into a pen drive using the software that I was told to use via the ubuntu website
[23:53] <DaemonicApathy> Hamtechperson: make  change, then exit.
[23:53] <ero-jiji> @ubuntu-tester1 no, i need it shared to a second user account on the same machine
[23:53] <tekk> so ikonia, without any bonding at all… what danger is there in making a simple socks proxy that selects several physical interfaces and chooses them on a round robin basis?
[23:53] <BroUnicorn> I did it on the Windows partition that I have boot camped on my mac. NOW, how do I actually run and use ubuntu?
[23:53] <tekk> as a possible "solution"
[23:53] <Nukien> Can anyone point me in the right direction to create my own udeb for inclusion on a customized ISO that can use dialog to ask questions of the user?
[23:53] <tekk> (its a real question, i wanna know what point i'm missing)
[23:53] <tekk> *so i don't waste my time
[23:54] <orbitwhite> tekk, as for me u already do, but u will realize it later
[23:54] <orbitwhite> at this point seems like its impossible to explain why this idea not worth it
[23:54] <tekk> so you suggest the best practise for now is to just give my wife 1 dongle whilst i use the other?
[23:54] <ubuntu-tester1> ero-jiji: is sharing with any account OK?
[23:54] <tekk> as god intended
[23:55] <orbitwhite> this is the only solution according to provided facts as i see it
[23:55] <Hamtechperson> It worked! Thanks everyone!
[23:55] <ero-jiji> @ubuntu-tester that would be fine, theres only my admin account, and 2 accounts im setting up on it, its a remote server so i dont have physical access
[23:55] <TimeRider_UK> :) pleased to be of assistance hamtechperson :)
[23:55] <Nukien> Good example would be the tasksel screen, which asks the user which tasks to include
[23:55] <tekk> and i doubt anyone is using bond0 interface for an enterprise solution…. so what is it used for?
[23:56] <tekk> or is it a left over kernel artifact
[23:56] <TimeRider_UK> Hamtechperson : case matters a lot :)
[23:56] <ikonia> tekk: bonding is used for MANY enterprise solutions
[23:56] <ubuntu-tester1> BroUnicorn: boot from pen drive, use, install
[23:56] <tekk> ubuntu linux kernel bonding?
[23:56] <tekk> really?
[23:56] <ikonia> tekk: linux kernel bonding, yes
[23:56] <ikonia> it's a very good solution
[23:56] <BroUnicorn> ubuntu-tester1: How do I boot from the pen drive though? Especially since I'm on a mac.
[23:56] <Nukien> Sorry - meant pkgsel, not tasksel
[23:56] <tekk> i thought people would prefer a hardware solution
[23:56] <tekk> given enough money
[23:57] <Hamtechperson> Figured that out on yer own, did ya TimeRider?
[23:57] <ikonia> tekk: some do, but it's a good solution, so more than usable by many people
[23:57] <orbitwhite> tekk, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_bonding
[23:57] <TimeRider_UK> Hamtechperson : no, I asked in here :p
[23:57] <tekk> can you give me a use case other than link agg
[23:57] <tekk> so i can understand it better
[23:57] <DaemonicApathy> BroUnicorn: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1948
[23:57] <ubuntu-tester1> !mac | BroUnicorn
[23:57] <ubottu> BroUnicorn: For help on installing and using Ubuntu on a mac, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages
[23:57] <Hamtechperson> BroUnicorn, can you get at the BIOS of the computer?
[23:57] <ero-jiji> @ubuntu-tester1 that would be fine, theres only my admin account, and 2 accounts im setting up on it, its a remote server so i dont have physical access
[23:58] <ikonia> tekk: not really for this channel, but the wiki is quite good
[23:58] <BroUnicorn> Hamtechperson: On a mac? I'm not quite sure. I have Windows partitioned on it already, so I hold alt when the computer starts up and can choose between Mac Windows and Recovery HD, but the usb does not show up among those options.
[23:58] <slowwritespeed> does partition table matter?
[23:58] <ubuntu-tester1> ero-jiji: give that folder proper permissions (readable by others) with chmod
[23:58] <tekk> the wiki describes the wrong kind of bonding
[23:59] <tekk> there are something like 4 methods available in kernel bonding
[23:59] <tekk> /approaches
[23:59] <orbitwhite> tekk, u asked for examples, u can expand from that wiki on google
[23:59] <ubuntu-tester1> ero-jiji: chmod -R u+r /path/to/folder
[23:59] <Xeago> I installed ubuntu server and can access the server fine from local network
[23:59] <orbitwhite> to discover certain cases and solutions where it used
