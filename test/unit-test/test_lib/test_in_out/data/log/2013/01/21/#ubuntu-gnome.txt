[20:33] <darkxst> ricotz, well my jhbuild issue has gone away, however don't know if it was eglibc update that fixed it or some bumped build dep
[21:17] <darkxst> ricotz, can you revert this patch in the g-s on staging http://bugzilla-attachments.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=218671
[21:43] <ricotz> darkxst, you confirmed it reduces the mem-usages and doesnt cause lock-ups?
[21:44] <darkxst> yeh, I havent seen a single gc deadlock with it reverted
[21:44] <darkxst> and it greatly helps mem usage
[21:44] <ricotz> ok
[21:53] <ricotz> darkxst, pushed
[21:53] <darkxst> thanks
[22:02] <ricotz> darkxst, will push a new mozjs188 too since there were some js related changes
[22:04] <darkxst> ok
[22:08] <ricotz> (forgot about the gnome-common bump)
