[16:01] <m_3> crap... one sec
[16:01] <m_3> move to http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server for release bug tracking
[16:01] <arosales> Daviey: jamespage ^ is that ready?
[16:02] <arosales> ie all the bugs pertinent at hhttp://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server 
[16:02] <jamespage> arosales, I don't think si
[16:02] <jamespage> so
[16:02]  * arosales updated the IRC commands to only use http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server 
[16:02] <jamespage> I'll deal with that (new years resolution #1)
[16:02] <m_3> which relates to the next one?
[16:02] <m_3> deprecate http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html
[16:02] <Daviey> super
[16:02] <arosales> jamespage: thank you
[16:03] <m_3> ok, roaksoax to review MAAS bugs, and sync with upstream
[16:04] <m_3> anyone... anyone... bueller?
[16:04] <arosales> I don't think roaksoax is here . . .
[16:04] <m_3> ok, so arosales to investigate why status tracker is not picking up servercloud area
[16:05] <arosales> m_3: this is done. It was mainly due to us updating after feature freeze
[16:05] <arosales> and some blueprints having "work items" in the white board
[16:05] <m_3> ok, so maybe this one is old too? "jamespage, smoser: we need to review/approve the final few BPs for the release and then retarget"
[16:05] <arosales> so good thing to take note of in blueprints to _not_ include the string, "work item" in the white board
[16:06] <arosales> all servercloud blueprints should be updated now, and we have a burn down :-)
[16:06] <arosales> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-raring/group/topic-raring-servercloud-overview.html
[16:06] <m_3> heartfelt yay from the stands
[16:06] <arosales> roaksoax to review MAAS bugs, and sync with upstream
[16:06]  * arosales sees roaksoax joined 
[16:07] <Daviey> roaksoax: ?
[16:07] <roaksoax> arosales: howdy! So MAAS work for precise is pretty much done
[16:07] <roaksoax> arosales: SRU's have been sitting there for ages, hence, they are still there
[16:07] <roaksoax> arosales: initially we had the plan to SRU everything, but it seems that we will no longer to be able to do so
[16:08] <roaksoax> arosales: so we are going to have to talk to the TB to get whatever we need
[16:08] <roaksoax> we will have to request and exception
[16:08] <roaksoax> Daviey: ^^
[16:08] <roaksoax> smoser: ^^
[16:08] <arosales> roaksoax: ok, thanks for the update. Let us know what you find.

[16:19] <m_3> I guess the important thing to ask about in any of these is blockers
[16:19] <arosales> roaksoax: thanks.  bbcmicrocomputer is also going to take a look at mysql so you may want to sync up with him.
[16:19] <m_3> does anyone have blockers that the rest of the team needs to know about or be reminded about?
[16:19] <arosales> the mysql charm that is.
[16:20] <m_3> ok, shall we move on to events or do we want to spend more time with blueprints?

[17:04] <ogasawara> inadvertantly gone missing after the rebase.
[17:04] <ogasawara> Important upcoming dates:
[17:04] <ogasawara>  * Raring:
[17:04] <ogasawara>   * Fri Jan 18 - 13.04 Month 3 Milestone (1 week)
[17:04] <ogasawara>   * Mon Feb 18 - 13.04 Month 4 Milestone (~6 weeks)
[17:04] <ogasawara>  * Precise:
