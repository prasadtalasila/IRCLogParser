[02:02] <HowdyDoody> When Upgrading ubuntu, I get questions to replace or keep a file.    Like   smb.conf ?    Very subtle differences.    If I don't know for sure is there a "SAFE" answer ?
[02:50] <rmg51> yes

[14:45] <ChinnoDog> Anyone here use minbif? I was going to use bitlbee with libpurple but this looks a lot better. https://symlink.me/projects/minbif/wiki
[17:32] <HowdyDoody> I ran the CD for 12.10 to upgrade my system and it wiped out the /home/rich area in put int empty stuff.
[17:33] <HowdyDoody> Doing "df" shows the volume at 50GB with 25GB used and 22GB free.
[17:33] <HowdyDoody> Doing DU at /  shows only 9.7 GB
[17:34] <HowdyDoody> How to discover the 15GB that is "hiding" from me ?     ls -al does not show anything revealing.
[19:03] <ChinnoDog> HowdyDoody: what file system are you using?
