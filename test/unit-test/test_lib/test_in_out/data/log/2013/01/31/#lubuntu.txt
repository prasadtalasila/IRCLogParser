[00:00] <genoobie> all three urls?
[00:00] <genoobie> Xorg, lspci, and lsmod?
[00:00] <wxl> sure if you want, but i'd probably just pull out the relevant lines from the lspci and actually include that text in the bug description
[00:01] <wxl> or include all three but explain you have a savage-ix or whatever the heck the dumb thing is called XD
[00:02] <genoobie> urgh, what are the relevant lines from the lspci??
[00:05] <wxl> oh hold on
[00:05] <genoobie> nm
[00:05] <genoobie> I think I got it,
[00:05] <genoobie> just the VGA compat controller
[00:05] <genoobie> just put that right in the bug report
[00:06] <wxl> sorry for the message
[00:06] <wxl> figured i'd flood you and nott the whole channel :)
[00:07] <wxl> genoobie: you can keep the rest of the convo going here
[00:08] <genoobie> oaky
[00:08] <genoobie> okay I mean
[00:08] <genoobie> the wireless isn't working either
[00:08] <genoobie> I figured I give that a go in the live CD
[00:08] <wxl> hold
[00:09] <genoobie> or should I install 1st...holding
[00:09] <wxl> do you have ethernet?
[00:09] <genoobie> yes
[00:10] <wxl> then i'd go ahead and install with ethernet
[00:10] <genoobie> working too :)
[00:10] <genoobie> okay
[00:10] <wxl> but first
[00:10] <wxl> lspci -vvnn | grep 14e4
[00:10] <genoobie> in the live?
[00:10] <wxl> let me know what's after the 14e4
[00:10] <wxl> yep
[00:10] <genoobie> now the terminal window is still in "ubuntu-bug blah"
[00:11] <genoobie> should I ctrl c?
[00:11] <wxl> no
[00:11] <genoobie> hrm
[00:11] <wxl> just open a new terminal
[00:11] <wxl> or a new tab in the same terminal
[00:11] <genoobie> the bug says reported in launchpad
[00:11] <wxl> then yeah you can kill it
[00:12] <genoobie> see, I wish I had the skills to update the driver file to fix the problem :)
[00:12] <wxl> well we all have our limits XD
[00:12] <genoobie> 4320
[00:13] <wxl> wweird
[00:13] <genoobie> but the lspci reports 4306
[00:13] <wxl> those are diffeent
[00:13] <wxl> don't worry
[00:13] <wxl> but you need b43legacy
[00:13] <genoobie> okay, another bug report?
[00:13] <wxl> nono
[00:13] <wxl> broadcom chips are ALWAYS a problem
[00:13] <genoobie> heh
[00:14] <wxl> there's a whole page on the ubuntu wiki for it
[00:14] <genoobie> yay ready for the install
[00:14] <genoobie> this usually takes about an hour
[00:14] <wxl> sudo apt-get install firmware-b43legacy-installer
[00:14] <wxl> needs to be restarted
[00:14] <wxl> do that after the install
[00:14] <genoobie> uh wait
[00:14] <wxl> like when you're in the installed thing
[00:15] <genoobie> will running in a more minimal x-enviro help the computer stream video?
[00:15] <genoobie> because even though I'm gradually migrating over to linux
[00:16] <genoobie> xp pro still runs pretty well on this machine
[00:16] <wxl> probably more of a ram issue than anything
[00:16] <genoobie> and I happen to have the license.
[00:17] <genoobie> I can hard shut down the machine now, right?
[00:17] <wxl> when you're done installing
[00:17] <genoobie> well xp can stream it same hardware.
[00:17] <genoobie> and dare I say full screen almost smooth...
[00:17] <genoobie> :)
[00:18] <genoobie> I've got 50 gigs
[00:18] <genoobie> I'll probably set aside 25 for lubuntu and 25 for experimental
[00:18] <genoobie> antix, bodhi, etc.
[00:19] <genoobie> or 35 lubuntu and 15 experimental...doesn't really matter I'll never get close to those limits anyhow...
[00:21] <wxl> every now and then i try a new os
[00:21] <wxl> mainly i like lubuntu
[00:22] <wxl> arch is a close second
[00:24] <genoobie> yeah, I had some problems with arch
[00:25] <genoobie> don't want to update the installer
[00:25] <genoobie> arch seems pretty customizable
[00:25] <genoobie> I like apt-get
[00:25] <genoobie> do not download updates while installing, correct?
[00:26] <genoobie> fluendo mp3 player??
[00:26] <genoobie> sure, why not.
[00:26] <genoobie> but I want to avoid updates, correct?
[00:27] <wxl> yep
[00:30] <Unit193> I've not been reading as I've been out, and also fixing issues, but if it's one package you can set a hold on it.
[00:32] <wxl> i already said that, mr. old news
[00:45] <genoobie> wxl, why not a big fan of puppy or bodhi?
[00:55] <wxl> puppy i find kludgy and bodhi's enlightment is just not my favorite desktop environment
[00:55] <wxl> genoobie: â†‘
[01:00] <genoobie> ugh
[01:00] <genoobie> screen is black
[01:00] <genoobie> install appears dead
[01:00] <genoobie> wtf
[01:00] <genoobie> I didn't step away for but a minute
[01:01] <genoobie> hdd light is not on
[01:01] <genoobie> argh
[01:01] <genoobie> c'mon.
[01:07] <genoobie> should I give it one more shot?
[01:09] <genoobie> I picked lubuntu because it seemed light
[01:09] <wxl> argh
[01:09] <wxl> it might be ubiquity
[01:09] <wxl> i had a hard time installing on a low-ram machine recently
[01:10] <wxl> i had to resort to using the alternate installed
[01:10] <wxl> installed/installer
[01:11] <kektal> I like lubuntu very much but suddenly it started to ask root password simply to connect to wlan
[01:11] <kektal> what went wrong?
[01:12] <wxl> :O
[01:12] <wxl> now there's a new one
[01:12] <wxl> what version are you on kektal ?
[01:12] <kektal> 12.10 all updates
[01:12] <kektal> 64bit
[01:12] <wxl> wow
[01:14] <wxl> Unit193: didn't we used to, like 2 versions ago, have a problem with passwords for wifi?
[01:18] <genoobie> ugh, seriously I have to download my 4th iso?
[01:18] <genoobie> another coaster...
[01:18] <wxl> you need rws genoobie :)
[01:18] <genoobie> rws?
[01:19] <wxl> re-writeable discs
[01:20] <genoobie> heh
[01:21] <genoobie> just reading on a forum about anti-x
[01:21] <genoobie> based on peanut linux
[01:21] <genoobie> looking for something that I can "grow" into
[01:22] <kektal> been a while since I've used linux, is 20gb root still considered plenty? it's filling awfully fast
[01:25] <wxl> welllllllllll i'm headed home
[01:26] <wxl> i'll be back later tho
[01:26] <wxl> best of luck to you genoobie
[01:26] <wxl> sorry i couldn't be of more help kektal but yes 20gb is enough
[01:27] <genoobie> thanks for all the help wxl
[01:28] <genoobie> if anything I learned pastebinit
[01:29] <kektal> wxl nvm
[01:36] <Unit193> kektal: Do you have it selected to allow all users to use the settings?
[01:37] <Unit193> genoobie: AntiX is Debian testing based, was mepis.
[01:37] <kektal> Unit193: dunno, where to see?
[01:39] <Unit193> It's a checkbox in the network settings.
[01:41] <kektal> Unit193: yes it is *available* once connected to all, but connecting to other wlans require root password every time
[01:42] <kektal> as well as trying to edit any network settings,
=== IboS_ is now known as IboS
[04:49] <wxl> genoobie: you all fixed yet?
[04:50] <genoobie> nah
[04:51] <genoobie> trying a debian install
[04:51] <genoobie> it's rough too
[04:51] <genoobie> and somehow the debian I picked has the 2.6 kernel
[04:51] <genoobie> wtf
[04:51] <genoobie> this is all goofed
[04:52] <genoobie> wxl, lubuntu is lxde correct?
[04:53] <wxl> yeppers
[04:53] <genoobie> I mean I can always change that later
[04:53] <wxl> you gave up on lubuntu for some reason?
[04:53] <genoobie> wxl would I really expect much better performance out of debian
[04:54] <genoobie> nah, I was waiting for lubuntu to download
[04:54] <wxl> well remember ubuntu's upstream is debian
[04:55] <wxl> so there's not too much difference
[04:55] <genoobie> I could try and trim it if I felt like it
[05:03] <genoobie> I'm thinking what I should do is give up on this crappy hardware :)
[05:05] <wxl> well that's a thought
[05:05] <wxl> given that i STILL have a powerbook g3 ppc that i plan on putting lubuntu on, i probably can't back you on it though :)
[05:08] <genoobie> remember the 12.04 lubuntu failed in "desktop" without reasonable cause
[05:08] <wxl> ya
[05:08] <wxl> and this is why you started downloading the alternate, yes?
[05:09] <genoobie> yes
[05:09] <genoobie> in the meantime I had a debian distro around
[05:11] <genoobie> was thinking that xfce might be a bit lighter still
[05:11] <wxl> my experience dictates otherwise
[05:20] <genoobie> have you ever upgraded a *nix OS?
[05:21] <wxl> hell yes
[05:21] <genoobie> reliable?
[05:21] <wxl> as a general rule
[05:21] <genoobie> my lubuntu on one machine is 11
[05:21] <wxl> i tend to run pretty bleeding edge and i rarely have problems
[05:21] <genoobie> it keeps asking to go to 12.
[05:21] <wxl> i'm running 13.04 daily (well, as of about a week ago) on an amd64 laptop with <512mb ram
[05:21] <genoobie> I have an NAS for all my mission critical data
[05:22] <wxl> cie
[05:22] <wxl> er
[05:22] <wxl> nice
[05:22] <TheLordOfTime> my rule of thumb is clean install with each upgrade
[05:22] <genoobie> so i can reinstall w/o a prob
[05:22] <TheLordOfTime> therefore i'm usually 2 releases behind
[05:22] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[05:22] <wxl> i usually do-release-upgrade
[05:22] <wxl> hah
[05:34] <genoobie>  /join ##freebsed
[05:34] <genoobie> oops
[05:41] <genoobie> still installing
[05:42]  * wxl begins installing on a virtual x86 w/ 512mb of ram
[05:43] <genoobie> wxl, what for?
[05:43] <wxl> genoobie: testing, always testing
[05:43] <mysteriousdaren> wxl: you have so much time for activities....aka testing
[05:44] <genoobie> so what is your motive here..
[05:44] <wxl> mysteriousdaren: presently tho that's not always the case
[05:44] <wxl> genoobie: hopefuly help the next release work :)
[05:45] <mysteriousdaren> wxl: good man
[06:11] <genoobie> holy
[06:12] <wxl> i'm not that good
[06:12] <wxl> :
[06:12] <wxl> er :O
[06:13] <genoobie> at least the splash screen is up longer...
[06:14] <genoobie> wxl, openbox is just another DE correct?
[06:14] <wxl> window manager
[06:14] <wxl> but yes
[06:14] <genoobie> before I do anything else
[06:15] <genoobie> I want to take care of that hold
[06:15] <wxl> HO
[06:15] <wxl> you have an install
[06:15] <wxl> excellent
[06:16] <genoobie> error
[06:17] <genoobie> operation requires read/write access to dpkg status area
[06:17] <genoobie> sudo echo?
[06:17] <wxl> hm
[06:17] <wxl> sudo dpkg more likely
[06:17] <genoobie> okay
[06:17] <genoobie> got the $
[06:18] <genoobie> now I can update freely
[06:18] <genoobie> last thing
[06:18] <genoobie> brb
[06:24] <genoobie> okay
[06:24] <genoobie> now I am talking to you from inside my install finally
[06:24] <genoobie> I am happy
[06:24] <wxl> ooooo
[06:24] <wxl> and you've learned a lot along the way
[06:24] <wxl> now go my son, and spread the gospel according to lubuntu :)
[06:25] <genoobie> so the only other thing I'd like to address is the wireless
[06:25] <genoobie> the b43legacy
[06:25] <genoobie> I'd rather not use the additional drivers thing because that froze in xubuntu
[06:25] <genoobie> don't see why I'd expect much different here atm
[06:25] <genoobie> so to do it manually...
[06:25] <wxl> oh it should work fine
[06:25] <wxl> unless there's another bug of some kind
[06:26] <genoobie> well
[06:26] <genoobie> I wouldn't be shocked
[06:26] <genoobie> so you say skip the manual steps
[06:26] <genoobie> just use the additional drivers tool?
[06:26] <wxl> nope
[06:26] <wxl> hold
[06:27] <wxl> sudo apt-get install firmware-b43legacy-installer
[06:30] <genoobie> or I should say the restricted drivers tool
[06:30] <genoobie> btw this is much smoother than 11 on a higher powered machine
[06:30] <genoobie> I like it
[06:30] <genoobie> nice, got a crash
[06:30] <genoobie> probably b/c of updates
[06:30] <genoobie> should I update first?
[06:30] <wxl> yeah prolly a good idea
[06:31] <genoobie> sudo apt-get update?
[06:31] <wxl> yeps
[06:37] <genoobie> okay wlan card lights are on
[06:38] <genoobie> configuring...
[06:45] <genoobie> okay
[06:45] <genoobie> I am going to update...
[06:47] <genoobie> seems like it would have to do a partial upgrade 1st
[06:48] <wxl> ?
[06:49] <genoobie> seems like there'd be a hierarchy to some upgrades
[06:49] <genoobie> this lubuntu seems better than 11
[06:50] <wxl> if you're on package x and the next available is z, you don't have to get y first
[06:50] <wxl> if that's what you mean
[06:50] <genoobie> well because of deps you'd think so pkgs would have to be installed first
[06:51] <genoobie> but maybe aptitude takes care of all that
[06:51] <wxl> it does
[06:51] <genoobie> hrm there's a new kernel
[06:52] <genoobie> I also get a bit scared when the logout / login happens b/c there's a display shift
[06:52] <genoobie> and it goes a bit nutty
[06:52] <genoobie> I think, uh og
[06:52] <wxl> don't sweat it
[06:53] <genoobie> ok
[06:53] <genoobie> going to install flash and see how it works in chromium
[06:54] <genoobie> then I've got one more laptop to install this on and all laptops will be lubuntu
[06:54] <genoobie> tx for all your hard work
[06:54] <wxl> np
[06:54] <genoobie> what is gnome-shell?

[08:08] <genoobie> well, I can't get stupid flash to work
[08:08] <genoobie> was wondering if he had any tips (in chromium)
[08:09] <Noskcaj> genoobie,  i assume you have install the restriced extras already
[08:09] <genoobie> nope
[08:09] <genoobie> you mean flash-player>
[08:09] <Noskcaj> apt-get install lubuntu-restricted-extras
[08:10] <Noskcaj> it will help, could fix it
[08:11] <genoobie> okay
[08:11] <genoobie> installing via synaptic
[08:11] <genoobie> it says it wants to remove ffmpeg
[08:11] <genoobie> just let it?
[08:12] <genoobie> Noskcaj, then once the restricted extras are installed reinstall flash player?
[08:13] <Noskcaj> genoobie, sure, you can reinstall ffmpeg later if it maters, it should put flash in
[08:13] <Noskcaj> worst case, just install chrome
[08:13] <genoobie> wait, the restricted extras pkg puts in flash player?
[08:13] <Noskcaj> yup
[08:14] <genoobie> oh eff
[08:14] <genoobie> I am looking at the details window of synaptic and I have to agree to some M$ eula
[08:14] <genoobie> any way to do this from synaptic?
[08:15] <genoobie> urgh
[08:15] <genoobie> wish I did this at cli
[08:15] <Noskcaj> do it then, run the command
[08:16] <Noskcaj> strangely, lubuntu isn't in the ubuntu software center
[08:16] <genoobie> what will happen with synaptic?
[08:17] <Noskcaj> idk, you try and work that out, i will get the repo's for flash
[08:17] <genoobie> hrm
[08:18] <genoobie> brb
[08:25] <genoobie> hey Noskcaj
[08:25] <Noskcaj> genoobie, nice link for you here, http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/10/to-do-list-after-new-installation-of.html , it includes the install instructions for flash, among other things.
[08:26] <genoobie> rock on man
[08:26] <Noskcaj> :)
[08:26] <Noskcaj> one of these things should fix your issue, otherwise install chrome from that link
[08:27] <genoobie> Noskcaj, i installed 12.04, does that still apply?
[08:27] <genoobie> re: fresh install
[08:27] <Noskcaj> should do, i will check but those repos should still work
[08:28] <genoobie> okay
[08:31] <Noskcaj>  http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/06/what-to-do-after-new-installation-of.html for 12.04, should be the same
[08:37] <genoobie> cool that rocks
[08:37] <Noskcaj> np
[08:48] <genoobie> hrm
[08:48] <genoobie> installing without verification?
[08:48] <genoobie> ok

[10:27] <agura> I ma new to lubuntu and unix systems and having some problems.  When I do a shutdown I get some instructions on the screen just before it goes dark.  Is there somewhere these instructions are stored so I can look at them with the computer on?
[10:41] <inductiveload> agura: are they instructions or just some information?
[10:42] <inductiveload> if they say things like "unmounting filesystems...done" they are just letting you know how the shutdown is going
[10:43] <agura> They are instructions to fix this and fix that...
[10:44] <agura> The problem is they are so fast and I don't really understand yet what they mean...
[10:49] <inductiveload> phone video camera ;-)
[10:50] <inductiveload> if it's after the local filesystem is unmounted, no logging can happen
[10:52] <agura> OK, I thought of taking a picture but wondered if there was another way... Thanks.  I will be back once I can work out what it wants me to do.

[14:41] <genoobie> wxl: well
[14:41] <genoobie> I fought most of the night
[14:41] <genoobie> I still couldn't get flash to work on chromium (although in 11 it worked almost out of the box)
[14:42] <genoobie> I installed both firefox and chrome and neither one worked
[14:42] <genoobie> (with flash)
[14:43] <genoobie> besides those browsers are so heavy for that older hardware I probably couldn't stream video anyhow
[14:43] <genoobie> so I am opting (I think) to go with puppylinux
[14:43] <genoobie> if I change my mind later, I'll be back....
[15:16] <calmarcus> I did some updates on my laptop today and it would no longer boot properly. It told me that it could not start the xserver. How to I restore my computer back to before the update.
[15:36] <calmarcus> I  recently  updated my laptop and the update seems to have messed up my computer. It was telling me that my hard drive had errors and I needed to run the command fsck. I ran the command and now I can see me desktop background and it has the terminal in the upper left corner but I cannot see any thing else. What do I need to do?
=== 16SAAVUOB is now known as Moewe
[17:28] <jpice> Does anyone have any experience with lxrandr for video out on a laptop install?
[17:29] <jpice> I can seem to figure out how to disable display mirroring
[17:30] <inductiveload> jpice: try arandr if you want more than just on/off and resolution control
[17:30] <jpice> Is that different from xrandr?
[17:31] <inductiveload> it's a graphical front-end to xrandr
[17:32] <holstein> arandr always works for me, on supported graphics hardware
[17:33] <jpice> Worked great. Thanks
[17:39] <jpice> Does arandr / xrandr support the mirroring of displays at different resolutions? I.e., my laptop displays at 1366 x 768, and display at 1920x1080, but I would like the screens to look identical
[17:40] <inductiveload> can you change your monitor output to 1266 x 768?
[17:41] <inductiveload> 1366...
[17:41] <inductiveload> right click on it in arandr
[17:44] <jpice> That's what I thought to do, but for some reason, it only allows me to output HDMI at 1920x1080
[17:45] <jpice> I guess it's possible the monitor Im using only supports 1080p (It's a projector).
[17:54] <inductiveload> you could play with xrandr --scale?
[17:55] <inductiveload> try "xrandr --output HDMI-0 --scale 0.71x0.71"
[17:56] <inductiveload> where HDMI-0 is the output

[20:23] <Noskcaj> ok, i'm out of ideas then. maybe put chrome on?
[20:23] <genoobie> tried still nothing
[20:24] <wxl> genoobie: that's a good idea Noskcaj mentioned. chrome has its own flash. NOT chromium.
[20:24] <genoobie> besides chrome is *so* resource intensive that video will likely not stream smoothly
[20:24] <Unit193> You can use flash from chrome in chromium, so I hear.
[20:24] <genoobie> Unit193: yeah, something to do with pepper
[20:25] <genoobie> I don't have the skills for that kind of install, though I am trying to learn
[20:25] <Unit193> I'm sorry I missed the first bit again, but can you get the stream URL and use mplayer, VLC, or other such stuff?
[20:25] <wxl> Unit193: where does one hear this?
[20:25] <genoobie> Unit193: have not tried yet, but that's a good idea..duhr
[20:26] <Unit193> wxl: From the voices, they're all around.
[20:26] <genoobie> Unit193: can those players play flash?
[20:26] <wxl> snakes! snakes!
[20:26] <Unit193> genoobie: Not flash, but flv files which is what the flash play is most likely using.
[20:26] <Unit193> I've done it many a time.
[20:27] <genoobie> hrm
[20:27] <genoobie> what do you do if you want to watch a short vid on youtube
[20:28] <Unit193> Actually, VLC I know supports just pasteing the youtube URL in, but it will try to pull the high-res version, IIRC.
[20:29] <genoobie> maybe there's hope yet...chances are it would run better in VLC anyhow
[20:30] <genoobie> as opposed to being integrated in the browser
[20:30] <Unit193> VLC is Qt, and isn't as lightweight as others.
[20:30] <genoobie> oh
[20:30] <Unit193> Others == mplayer, a CLI application.  I still find it better than flash.
[20:31] <genoobie> Unit193: can you watch youtube vids in mplayer (by pasting?)
[20:31] <genoobie> I know this seems like a lot of energy for some stupid youtube vids
[20:31] <Unit193> As far as I know, you need to pull the flv url.
[20:31] <Unit193> genoobie: I do kind of understand.
[20:33] <genoobie_> hey back
[20:33] <genoobie_> something happened to the irc interface
[20:38] <genoobie_> bbl
[20:38] <genoobie_> still have to do more grading
[20:38] <genoobie_> the interface is smooth, I'd just like to test out flash
[20:39] <genoobie_> bbl
[21:19] <ray> hi there
[21:22] <ray> if somebody can help it would be appreciated: I am looking for a way to run the installer from within a live system through the command line
[21:23] <holstein> ray: via ssh ?
[21:23] <holstein> you could forward x over and forward the istaller maybe
[21:23] <ray> nope, via the terminal
[21:23] <holstein> ray: sure.. im just not sure what the goal is
[21:23] <holstein> ray: there is an alternate "text" installer
[21:26] <ray> ok, I am on a power pc arch and booting a kernel wasn't that easy. The problem is that the graphics are so poor, I can only use the terminal really. I know about the alternater installer but as it was quite difficult to boot the iso I've got I would prefer to go on from there
[21:27] <holstein> ray: i would use the alternate installer
[21:27] <holstein> ray: PPC support will not be getting any better
[21:27] <holstein> i would use 12.04, the alternate installer, for PPC
[21:27] <holstein> ray: i was told in here the other day that it works great
[21:28] <ray> ok, thanks, I will give it a try
[21:29] <wxl> ray: what machine are you on?
[21:29] <holstein> ray: i should say, my first hand experience was.. i dont run PPC linux anymore
[21:29] <wxl> ray: more specifically, what video card?
[21:30] <holstein> ray: i feel it is a waste of time since comparable PC hardware that is well supported is cheap/free
[21:38] <ray> radeon 7500 it is
[21:38] <wxl> which lubuntu version and which arch? g3? g4? new world? old world?
[21:39] <ray> g' new world 12.10
[21:39] <ray> 4
[21:39] <ray> g4, sry
[21:39] <wxl> k 1s
[21:45] <wxl> ray: have you tried video=ofonly as a yaboot command?
[21:45] <ray> yes, it screwd up everything
[21:45] <ray> even poorer graphics and system halted
[21:45] <wxl> see if video=radeonfb:1024x768-32 doesnt help then
[21:45] <ray> ok
[21:46] <wxl> er
[21:46] <wxl> that's messed up
[21:46] <wxl> stupid wiki
[21:46] <wxl> video=radeonfb:1024x768-32@60
[21:47] <wxl> i assume you've already seen the graphics section of the ubuntu ppc faq. if that doesn't work, you may want to peruse it for some ideas, mayhap messing with Xorg.conf. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ#Configure_graphics
[21:48] <wxl> radeon.modeset=0 may be useful as well, mayhap in concert with the radeonfb above
[21:49] <wxl> ppc's biggest problem, hands down, in ubuntu is video. if you can conquer this, you got it.
[21:49] <ray> yep I've seen it, but overlooked the radeon specific part, thx
[21:49] <wxl> np
[21:50] <ray> well, conquering openfirmware was quite a challenge as well tbh
[21:50] <wxl> btw ppc is pretty unsupported across canonical. too many people think like holstein :) if you care to help out with testing, that would be nice
[21:50] <wxl> openfirmware sucks, but it's far worse on the g3s and old world's
[21:50] <wxl> brb
[21:50] <holstein> lol
[21:50] <ray> kk ;)
[21:51] <holstein> i dont think like anything.. its not canonical either.. its just dead
[21:51] <holstein> its going away.. not supported upstream
[21:51] <holstein> by all means, if you, or *anyone* wants to provide support, you are welcome, and encouraged to do so
[21:52] <holstein> but, its not easy, since nothing is going to trickle in from upstream.. it will likely continue trickling out, and become more and more challenging to maintain the base system with updated apps
[21:52] <ray> then let me ask you why do you guys focus on that distro specifically?
[21:53] <holstein> ray: lubuntu?
[21:53] <ray> yep
[21:53] <holstein> ray: this is the lubuntu support channel, so that is the topic, supporting lubuntu and LXDE in ubuntu
[21:53] <holstein> and, as best we can, the globally unsupported PPC versions
[21:53] <ray> I know it is, but I am curious about your personal motivations
[21:54] <holstein> ray: i use the software,, personally... i try and contribute support to "give bacK' when i can
[21:56] <ray> well i understand very well that par, what I don't get is, why not contributing to Ubuntu in general, or xubuntu, or edubuntu, why specifically lubuntu?
[21:57] <holstein> ray: i do, this channel is lubuntu specific though... i contribute where i can
[21:57] <holstein> ray: a lot of us try and contribute upstream as much as possible
[21:59] <ray> ok, sounds great. it must be shit loads of work and investment, isn't it?
[22:00] <holstein> ray: try and watch the language in the support channels
[22:00] <holstein> ray: we are mostly all volunteers, so its whatever we choose to devote
[22:01] <ray> sorry if it sounded rude, it wasn't my intention
[22:02] <holstein> ray: no worries.. glad you are here
