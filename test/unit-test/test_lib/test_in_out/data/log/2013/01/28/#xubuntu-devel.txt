[06:36] <ochosi> micahg: seems like you're fighting windmills...
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[21:02] <micahg> knome: if we actually had testers for powerpc, I don't see why we shouldn't make images, our packages aren't that broken on powerpc
=== Noskcaj is now known as Noskcaj_AFK
[21:10] <knome> micahg, if we have testers.
[21:19] <Unit193> There's a way to test it with qemu, and a couple have the hardware.  I might technically have the hardware, cousin was going to get rid of a G4, not sure if he has already.
[21:23] <micahg> well, I don't want powerpc tested at the expense of x86
[21:24] <Unit193> Well of course.
[21:49] <knome> micahg, is there any proof of testers?
[21:50] <knome> micahg, i overlooked the logs for the discussion, and if it's like "there's 1 guy, and this other who already does all kinds of PPC tests can help too", i'm not sure if we really want it
[21:50] <micahg> I'll have to ask phill for them
[21:51] <knome> can you ask him to tell the testers to send an email to -devel so we can see what the situation looks like?
[21:58] <Unit193> pleia2 said she had one, but didn't have time for more than once in a while.
[22:02] <astraljava> How many active machines do you imagine are out there, I mean potential Xubuntu users?
[22:05] <astraljava> And yes, I'm referring to the powerpc discussion, thankyouverymuch.
[22:22] <Unit193> Well, in theory you could use popcon to see ppc users of xfce4, but I don't see the link right now.
[23:18] <GridCube> from #xubuntu-es: <jairosuse> Solo quiero dar muchas gracias a este sistema operativo , tiene mucho futuro y solo pienso en extender la Filosofia GNU Linux (translates to: I just wanted to thank you all for this OS, you have a great future and i hope to extend the gnu/linux philosofy
