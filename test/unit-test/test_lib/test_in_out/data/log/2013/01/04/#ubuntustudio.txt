[07:39] <sam__> ubunto studio is on sda16
[07:40] <len-1304> Ok, you have a bunch of partitions what is not happening that should or happening that should not?
[07:40] <sam__> empty lvm partitions
[07:41] <len-1304> Not very descriptive
[07:42] <sam__> partition sda2 has sabayon on it that I am not able to get rid of
[07:43] <len-1304> Sabayon is a distro?
[07:44] <len-1304> You want to get rid of it so you can do what?
[07:44] <sam__> it is a gentoo distro
[07:45] <len-1304> And you have tried reformating?
[07:45] <sam__> that partition 2 be just ubuntu without sabayon
[07:46] <len-1304> So does it have some ubuntu on it right now?
[07:47] <len-1304> Do you just want to use it for storage? Or to put some part of the file tree on it? or another version of linux?
[07:47] <sam__> I reinstalled ubuntu 12.10 ontop of part 2 but sabayon stays there messing up partition
[07:48] <len-1304> Is sabayon on more than just that partition?
[07:48] <sam__> I want to recover partition
[07:50] <len-1304> You want to recover sda2. recover the ubuntu or the sabayon?
[07:51] <len-1304> If you have over written something, I don't know if it can be recovered.
[07:53] <sam__> thanks len I will try to put ubuntu studio on it see what happens bye for now
