[00:59] <JoseeAntonioR> balloons: going back to SergioMeneses' question, have you got slides to use for the classroom session tomorrow? (I'll be a helper, just in case)
[01:00] <balloons> JoseeAntonioR, no I didn't prepare any
[01:00] <balloons> since this is my first classroom, I guess I should look a bit more into what the normal format is
[01:01] <balloons> my plan was to talk, stream a little bit, then do q & a
[01:01] <JoseeAntonioR> oh, yep, that's fine
[01:01] <JoseeAntonioR> it's just that some instructors do slides for the people
[01:01] <JoseeAntonioR> and what do you mean by stream?
[01:11] <balloons> JoseeAntonioR, well, I was considering giving demos
[01:11] <balloons> my sessions is more q and a than anything
[01:11] <balloons> and perhaps follow along
[01:11] <JoseeAntonioR> balloons: hmm, and that was supposed to be on air?
[01:11] <balloons> informational
[01:12] <balloons> I was avoiding doing an on-air
[01:12] <balloons> lol
[01:12] <balloons> I think it would detract
[01:12] <balloons> but I could be wrong
[01:12] <JoseeAntonioR> yes, as people are not aware of that
[01:12] <JoseeAntonioR> and moving from one side to another can get them confused
[01:12] <balloons> yes, I know.. I didn't ask
[01:12] <balloons> :-)
[01:12] <JoseeAntonioR> :)
[01:12] <balloons> I didn't want to flip flop
[01:13] <balloons> anyways, so yea, plan is basically go through some things
[01:13] <balloons> then do q &
[01:13] <balloons> phi's sessions starts the instructional stuff
[01:49] <SergioMeneses> balloons, JoseeAntonioR Im back!
[01:50] <SergioMeneses> maybe next time balloons can do some slides :D it is really helpful

[20:50] <jcastro> mhall119: man dude, check this out http://www.iloveubuntu.net/twitter-app-tori-and-reddit-reader-demonstrate-how-interesting-apps-can-be-created-recently-released
[20:51] <mhall119> one of these days I'm going to draw a comic about the mythical "man dude"
[21:12] <doctormon> mhall119: Can you draw?
[21:13] <czajkowski> I just think of the turtles every time I hear it
[21:13] <czajkowski> DUDE
[21:14] <czajkowski> Awesome
[21:14] <czajkowski> totally
[21:14] <czajkowski> wicken!
[21:14] <czajkowski> ninja turtles
[21:14] <pleia2> wicked :)
[21:14] <czajkowski> that too
[21:21] <mhall119> doctormon: I used to
[21:21] <mhall119> yeah, wicken sounds like something totally different
[21:22] <doctormon> pleia2: lol
[21:22] <doctormon> mhall119: Do you have a gallery?
[21:22] <mhall119> doctormon: nope
[21:23] <mhall119> I used to do a bunch in high school, but then switch my focus to comp-sci and mostly stopped
[21:23] <mhall119> never did anything on computer either
[21:23] <doctormon> mhall119: As I was explaining to a new recruit for team programmer last night; design is more important than technicals these days.
[21:24] <mhall119> yeah, I saw a blog saying essentially that just recently
[21:24] <doctormon> (and I don't mean just UI design, but code and api design)
[21:25] <doctormon> pleia2: How goes the edu-reboot?
[21:50] <czajkowski> *yawns* evening folks
[21:50] <czajkowski> it's only Tuesday and I am in fact exhausted
[22:15] <pleia2> doctormon: I think jasna is working on getting the demo into canvas
[22:15] <pleia2> hopefully we'll have something to show for the work soon :)
[22:22] <doctormon> pleia2: Awesome, it's not about making the content right, just the course structures.
[22:42] <daker> hi mhall119 do you have a min ?
[22:58] <mhall119> daker: sure
[22:58] <daker> mhall119: thanks cjohnston is here, you will get a mail in a minute

[22:59] <cjohnston> im not here
[22:59] <czajkowski> doctormon: seen the -loco conctacts list they were looking for images for locoteams and approved locos no design folks suggested anything, thought that would have been a nice opportunity from the design community to get involved

[23:04] <daker> with django 1.3
[23:04] <mhall119> \o/
