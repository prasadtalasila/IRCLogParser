[03:19] <Amacidia> Hi everyone. Names David. I just emailed the ubuntu-quality list about an hour ago and was told this channel is a good place to communicate with other testers. I wouldn't say that I am an expert ubuntu user, but I have ubuntu experience, specifically with server. I'm hoping to start ISO testing soon.
[03:19] <Amacidia> Apparently there are some learning sessions coming up ?
[03:19] <Amacidia> That might be some handy training
[03:20] <Noskcaj> Amacidia, yes, the dates aren't set in stone but they should be done by the end of the month
[03:20] <Amacidia> Excellent, thanks Noskcaj
[03:21] <Noskcaj> np, you might want to install testdrive, it's very useful
[03:24] <Amacidia> That is what I'm planning to do
[03:26] <Amacidia> I have a i5 with 4gigs of ram. Between ubuntu 12.10 and testdrive, I hope it works out!
[03:27] <Noskcaj> should do fine, just change testdrive to use 1gb of ram, ubuntu only uses one
[04:13] <juggalonaut1> noskcaj im in
[04:23] <Noskcaj> juggalonaut1, hello, don't expect much talk in here for a few more hours. is your system up und running enough to do a few tests that i will run you through?
[04:26] <juggalonaut1> yes
[04:27] <Noskcaj> juggalonaut1, first, join this https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-qa and the mailing list. then install testdrive and virtualbox from the software centre, ping me when you're done
[04:29] <juggalonaut1> i have done the mailing list earlier today and ok
[04:30] <Noskcaj> the lubuntu one? some info on irc nicknames(we should have a wiki on this): phillw=phill whiteside, balloons=the boss=nicholas skaggs, ask me for anyone one else
[04:31] <Noskcaj> and pressing tab finishes peoples names
[04:32]  * phillw grr @ Noskcaj for false ping :P
[04:32] <Noskcaj> lol, anything you wanted to add?
[04:34] <Noskcaj> Amacidia, pay attention, this will help you as well
[04:34] <Noskcaj> once you have testdrive and vbox, open testdrive
[04:35] <phillw> Noskcaj: well, if you refer to someone in chat, break their name up... ball_oons is the name, but will not cause a ping, just as Nosk_aj or gili_r etc will not ping them when we are just chatting :D
[04:36] <Noskcaj> phillw, i know, i didn't break b'alloons's up because he's not online and i didn't for yours because i'm funny
[04:38]  * phillw ::SIGH:: and I'm dealing with a user on FB getting them secure in their mind to actually trust Tor to hide their foot-print? I think you know that person...
[04:39] <Noskcaj> lol
[04:41] <juggalonaut1> they are installed
[04:41] <phillw> Noskcaj: ... poke
[04:42] <Noskcaj> juggalonaut1, open testdrive, the go edit, preference. phillw hello
[04:42] <Noskcaj> done?
[04:42] <juggalonaut1> going
[04:42] <phillw> Noskcaj: please answer you PM
[04:42] <juggalonaut1> yes
[04:43] <Noskcaj> make sure release = raring, then go to the virtualisation tab
[04:43] <juggalonaut1> i am in prefrences
[04:43] <juggalonaut1> there
[04:44] <Noskcaj> take your pick on hypervisor, i use vbox, phill uses kvm. make sure memory is 1024mb. i have to go for a sec, i will be back soon
[04:45] <juggalonaut1> ok
[04:45] <juggalonaut1> that is done
[04:50] <Noskcaj> next tab. pick what distro's you want to test, then restart testdrive
[04:51] <Noskcaj> downlaod an iso through testdrive
[04:54] <juggalonaut1> its opening now
[04:55] <juggalonaut1> how do you download the iso via testdrive
[04:55] <Noskcaj> tick it then press sync
[04:55] <juggalonaut1> ok
[04:58] <Noskcaj> http://planet.ubuntu.com/ is a compilation of community blogs, quite interesting. http://qa.ubuntu.com/ is the testing homepage. http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/ is the iso tracker, where you submit results from daily installs. http://package.qa.ubuntu.com/ is the package tracker, only active in candence weeks. can't think of anything else you will need to know.
[04:58] <juggalonaut1> ok
[04:58] <juggalonaut1> im at 24%
[04:59] <Noskcaj> kk
[05:05] <juggalonaut1> 83%
[05:05] <Noskcaj> juggalonaut1, what iso are you downloading?
[05:05] <juggalonaut1> mythbuntu
[05:06] <Noskcaj> note the what
[05:06] <Noskcaj> ok?
[05:07] <juggalonaut1> its the other type of linux i have wanted to try
[05:07] <juggalonaut1> i use ubuntu tho
[05:07] <juggalonaut1> i know it by heart
[05:07] <juggalonaut1> its done launching now
[05:07] <Noskcaj> ok
[05:08] <balloons> good night all..
[05:08] <balloons> thanks for filling folks in Noskcaj
[05:08] <Noskcaj> balloons, np. you were on?
[05:09] <Noskcaj> sorry for the ping then
[05:09] <balloons> no no.. lol, I just got on, and noticed the time
[05:09] <balloons> :-)
[05:09] <Noskcaj> juggalonaut1, http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/243/builds/33052/testcases has the current testcases for mythbuntu amd64, please run one, record any errors you find
[05:10] <Noskcaj> and as a comment write "run in Vbox" or "run in KVM", i advise against kvm as it is temporarily broken
[05:10] <juggalonaut1> hey noskcaj its saying my cu is not compatable i need pae for it
[05:11] <juggalonaut1> cpu***
[05:11] <juggalonaut1> i use vbox
[05:11] <Noskcaj> sigh, i thought that might happen. did you install Vbox?
[05:11] <juggalonaut1> yes
[05:12] <Noskcaj> open it
[05:12] <juggalonaut1> ok
[05:12] <juggalonaut1> should i shut down the already open vbox
[05:12] <Noskcaj> yes, but remember its name(at the top)
[05:13] <juggalonaut1> ok
[05:13] <Noskcaj> find the vm you where just running, e.g. testdrive-16
[05:13] <Noskcaj> select it, click settings
[05:13] <juggalonaut1> its open and it was testdrive 5 and its selected
[05:14] <Noskcaj> open settings(for it), go system, click the cpu tab
[05:15] <juggalonaut1> im seeing processor not cpu
[05:16] <Noskcaj> oops, yeah, that. now toggle pae/nx
[05:17] <juggalonaut1> ok and im getting a error message about my ram
[05:17] <juggalonaut1> its saying not enough is left for my host os
[05:18] <Noskcaj> oh, how much ram do you have?
[05:19] <juggalonaut1> 1.10 gigs altho i have ran a windows virtual on this same computer before and it was fine with the same ram
[05:19] <Noskcaj> yeah, no vm testing for you unless you run xubuntu or lubuntu
[05:19] <Noskcaj> you could try only 512 for vbox
[05:19] <juggalonaut1> lol ok and i will try that
[05:19] <Noskcaj> but i doubt it will work
[05:20] <juggalonaut1> im trying now ill let you know
[05:21] <juggalonaut1> its loading
[05:23] <juggalonaut1> it is currently running
[05:23] <juggalonaut1> i am at the home screen
[05:23] <Noskcaj> :), now try to finish a testcase
[05:24] <juggalonaut1> ok i need a lil help with that
[05:26] <Noskcaj> ok, i dont have a mythbuntu iso, whats the problem
[05:27] <juggalonaut1> how od i finish a testcaseis m Q
[05:27] <juggalonaut1> do**
[05:27] <juggalonaut1> my*
[05:28] <Noskcaj> idk, mythbuntu confuses me, please get a different iso and tell me which one
[05:28] <juggalonaut1> ok what one do you know
[05:29] <Noskcaj> i recommend xubuntu as it is low ram usage, as is lubuntu
[05:29] <juggalonaut1> ok
[05:30] <juggalonaut1> downloading
[05:30] <Noskcaj> so xubuntu amd64?
[05:30] <juggalonaut1> i only have a 32 cpu
[05:30] <juggalonaut1> altho i am able to run a 64 on it
[05:30] <Noskcaj> oh, then can you do lubuntu i386
[05:31] <juggalonaut1> i run 64 ubuntu on a 32 cpu sometimes
[05:31] <Noskcaj> ok, take your pick. you should have 64bit though
[05:31] <juggalonaut1> lol ok
[05:31] <Noskcaj> its not a 64nit cpu then
[05:32] <juggalonaut1> i hate swapiness
[05:32] <Noskcaj> ok
[05:32] <juggalonaut1> i forgot to drop it to 10%
[05:32] <Noskcaj> you do xubuntu i386 i will do xubuntu Amd64
[05:32] <Noskcaj> lol
[05:33] <juggalonaut1> AMD Turion(tm) 64 Mobile Technology ML-40
[05:33] <juggalonaut1> i guess i do have a 64
[05:33] <tgm4883> questions on mythbuntu?
[05:34] <juggalonaut1> were wondering how to finish the testing
[05:34] <tgm4883> is there a confusing part somewhere?
[05:34] <tgm4883> link?
[05:35] <juggalonaut1> no we are just going to do xubuntu
[05:35] <Noskcaj> the testcase in general confuses me, thats why i dont test it
[05:35] <Noskcaj> ping me when your download has finished
[05:35] <juggalonaut1> noskcaj im at 40% on download
[05:35] <tgm4883> well if it's confusing, we should see why
[05:36] <Noskcaj> k
[05:36] <juggalonaut1> do you know of a way to lower swappiness w/o restarting the computer
[05:38] <Noskcaj> afternoon pitti_
[05:39] <juggalonaut1>  do you know of a way to lower swappiness w/o restarting the computer
[05:39] <pitti_> Good morning
=== pitti_ is now known as pitti
[05:39] <pitti> hey Noskcaj
[05:40] <pitti> happy new year everyone!
[05:40] <Noskcaj> happy new year, only 4 days late
[05:40] <juggalonaut1> i was gona say that lol
[05:41] <juggalonaut1> so anyone have any idea on how to change the swappiness without restarting the computer
[05:41] <Noskcaj> no
[05:41] <Noskcaj> !wait
[05:41] <ubot5> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
[05:42] <tgm4883> by this time, you could have just restarted the computer
[05:42] <Noskcaj> lol
[05:42] <Noskcaj> tgm4883, isn't it meant to be step by step like everything else? http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/243/builds/33052/testcases/1442/results
[05:42] <juggalonaut1> ok thank you and i dont like to shut off my computer when im downloading a iso
[05:43] <tgm4883> Noskcaj, isn't that step by step?
[05:43] <Noskcaj> just untick the iso, it keeps what it downloaded
[05:43] <Noskcaj> i'm only 26% anyway
[05:43] <tgm4883> http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/testcases/1442/info
[05:43] <juggalonaut1> im almost done
[05:46] <Noskcaj> tgm4883, not really, compared it to the other testcases, anyone should be able to understand
[05:47] <tgm4883> hmm
[05:48] <tgm4883> Noskcaj, I'm guessing your issue is with "Go though the Ubiquity install as you would any other install. Most options won't matter for this testcase, but be sure to choose the following options"
[05:48] <Noskcaj> exactly
[05:49] <tgm4883> I suppose I could write that all out, but I wasn't sure it was necessary. I've listed the only options that should matter
[05:49] <tgm4883> I wrote the testcase with the thought that anyone using the test case, would have done an Ubiquity install before
[05:50] <juggalonaut1> i am restarting my computer ill be back on in like 3 min
[05:51] <tgm4883> Noskcaj, would listing what page each bullet point is on make it more easy to understand? Or do I really need to write out every step?
[05:54] <Noskcaj> tgm4883, i don't really know, talk to balloons tomorrow. he might add it to the testcase jam wiki page
[05:54] <tgm4883> ok
[05:54] <juggalonaut1> i am back
[05:55] <juggalonaut1> do you have the install done noskcaj
[05:56] <Noskcaj> juggalonaut1, ok, i'm on 85%. start and the click the release notes link
[05:56] <juggalonaut1> ok
[05:56] <juggalonaut1> after the pae thing again
[05:57] <Noskcaj> do the same workaround :(
[05:57] <juggalonaut1> yea
[05:57] <juggalonaut1> i think i will always half to lol its ok
[05:57] <juggalonaut1> lower ram also
[05:58] <Noskcaj> you will, until someone fixes the bug
[05:59] <juggalonaut1> ehhh its ok

[12:28] <dkessel> pitti: thanks for the merge. too bad some of the tests are failing. but reading over the log i saw that most tests seem to be skipped anyway :/
[12:29] <pitti> dkessel: there's quite a few succeeding ones
[12:29] <pitti> dkessel: but the ones that differ by a trailing slash on file names look weird -- they don't look build environment specific at all
[12:30] <dkessel> pitti: i won't have much time to look at it in the next days because of work
[12:32] <pitti> dkessel: no biggie; once we enable the "failing tests block migration into ubuntu", we can just disable the upstream tests

[12:34] <pitti> dkessel: I mean if you don't have time/want to work on them, as soon as they become critical we can disable that autopkgtest
[12:35] <dkessel> ah, ok
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[16:16] <balloons>  alesage do you know if thomi got anywhere last night with the autopilot example?
[16:17] <alesage> balloons, no I don't--I think one of the autopilot-gtk dependencies needs updating to raring
[16:17] <balloons> ahh.. so did he pawn that off on you?
[16:17] <alesage> balloons, yes I intend to look into
[16:17] <balloons> :-)
[16:17] <balloons> ty
[16:17] <alesage> balloons, np
[18:14] <balloons> ok SergioMeneses so go ahead and branch
[18:14] <balloons>  bzr branch lp:ubuntu-autopilot-tests
[18:15] <SergioMeneses> kk
[18:17] <SergioMeneses> done
[18:18] <balloons> k, so you can re-use one of those as the shell
[18:19] <balloons> go ahead and hop into the pad
[18:19] <balloons> http://pad.ubuntu.com/uHcjCa80Qt
[18:19] <balloons> and we'll start writing the first pieces for the eog conversion
[18:19] <balloons> then we'll get you to commit it back and propose a merge ;-)
[18:20] <SergioMeneses> great!... Im going to check it these days
[18:20] <balloons> here's the link to the manual testcase
[18:20] <balloons> http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/testcases/1416/info
[18:22] <SergioMeneses> balloons, ty a lot for all! you rock!
[18:24] <balloons> let me know when your ready to start, hehe.. I know there's a bit of setup
[18:29] <SergioMeneses> balloons, perfect! ill do it
[19:43] <letozaf_> Hi balloons, you there ?
[19:55] <balloons> hello, indeed
[19:56] <balloons> time for some autopilot work letozaf_
[19:56] <balloons> :-)
[19:57] <letozaf_> yes :)
[19:57] <letozaf_> have you got time ?
[19:59] <balloons> yes, all reserved :-)
[20:00] <balloons> I wanted to chat with you and Noskcaj about an idea for keeping track of tasks
[20:00] <balloons> and phillw njin and dkessel too if they are about
[20:00] <balloons> I think Sergio is gone now
[20:00] <letozaf_> ok
[20:00] <dkessel> yes, I am reading :)
[20:01] <balloons> so, I found out lp doesn't really offer much for task tracking, and I was refferred to looking @ trello instead
[20:01] <balloons> I've used it in the past as a sort of collaborative to-do list
[20:02] <balloons> https://trello.com/
[20:03] <letozaf_> -->letozaf is looking at trello.com
[20:03] <letozaf_> looks good
[20:03] <dkessel> a fog creek product. sounds good ;)
[20:04] <balloons> https://trello.com/board/autopilot-tests/50e735ad7351f0a64e00040c
[20:04] <balloons> So, I'm guessing it could look something like this.. let me add some stuff
[20:05] <Noskcaj> oops, my backtrack download cancelled everything else
[20:05] <balloons> hehe
[20:06] <balloons> So, can you see the board?
[20:07] <Noskcaj> yep
[20:07] <letozaf_> yes I can and I also subscribed :)
[20:07] <dkessel> yup. and it updated without me refreshing the page. this is so post-2000 :)
[20:07] <dkessel> ok i'll register
[20:07] <letozaf_> I'm getting all the notifications of the changes you make
[20:07] <balloons> does it make sense? We can add more statuses, etc
[20:08] <balloons> so, then we can make other lists to keep track of the manual testcases as well, etc
[20:09] <letozaf_> yes, can you write something more descriptive in the needs review column ?
[20:09] <letozaf_> I mean like what needs to be reviewed about, lets say, evince, for instance
[20:10] <letozaf_> like a check list ...
[20:10] <Noskcaj> balloons, as something slightly related, can we add a timer for how long since each testcase was done?
[20:10] <dkessel> one should probably write the date/time when he/she last changed the status of a test
[20:10] <dkessel> oh wait you can see that by clicking items
[20:11] <balloons> umm, I haven't used this a bunch, but you can add comments and descriptions, so sure
[20:11] <balloons> Noskcaj, what do you mean by a timer?
[20:12] <Noskcaj> balloons, so you can see how many days since the testcase was last run
[20:13] <balloons> from?
[20:13] <balloons> I'm a bit confused...
[20:14] <balloons> ok great, well if you all like it, sign up and I'll add you
[20:14] <balloons> and add the rest of the targetted stuff
[20:14] <balloons> if adds your "face" to what you've claimed ;-)
[20:14] <Noskcaj> A timer that resets every time the testcase is completed.
[20:14] <letozaf_> I've signed already
[20:15] <balloons> Noskcaj, as far as executing these tests, we'll be doing them ad-hoc, and as part of the cadence stuff
[20:15] <balloons> they'll go on the tracker the same way our other tests work and are reported
[20:15] <balloons> we still have to work through making it easier to report, but we'll hammer it out :-)
[20:16] <Noskcaj> ok. the timer idea was for the iso tracker
[20:16] <balloons> we might want something more, or a better interface I suppose, but I don't see that as happening right away
[20:16] <dkessel> you can add me too
[20:16] <balloons> yes, makes sense
[20:16] <balloons> k, let me look
[20:16] <balloons> can you add yourself?
[20:16] <njin> I will subscribe only if you sjow us the face of your dog ;-P
[20:16] <balloons> njin, hello!
[20:16] <njin> hy
[20:17] <balloons> I do have a pic of my dog actually
[20:17] <balloons> one sec
[20:17]  * dkessel checks site for clues on how to join
[20:17] <dkessel> haha, can color the cards... like say red on the left, then orange, yellow and green when you move them to the right ;)
[20:18] <balloons> did I get everyone?
[20:20] <Noskcaj> yep
[20:21] <letozaf_> I'm ok
[20:22] <letozaf_> maybe we can all choose a color so we will see at a glance who's doing what
[20:22] <letozaf_> or who did what
[20:23] <dkessel> if we are not more than six people...
[20:23] <Noskcaj> my list of questions/ideas since i'm going to the beach in an hour or so. timer on iso tracker, why is there no lubuntu/xubuntu autopilot testcases?, can we add a ubiquity changelog similar to the d-i one to the iso tracker, when are the classroom sessions happening.
[20:23] <Noskcaj> good idea letozaf_
[20:23] <letozaf_> you can also add a check list, cool!
[20:23] <letozaf_> thanks Noskcaj :)
[20:24] <balloons> ohh colors!
[20:24] <balloons> Noskcaj, excellent questions
[20:24] <balloons> 1) let's add it as a bug request for a feature
[20:24] <balloons> 2) Because you haven't written them yet :-)
[20:24] <balloons> 3) We could, open a bug for it
[20:25] <balloons> 4) My date got erased, but I'm going next week. I'll send the email with my date today
[20:25] <balloons> I believe it was next thursday
[20:25] <balloons> Jan 10th
[20:25] <Noskcaj> ok
[20:26] <Noskcaj> ok, i just need to know my date soon as i might be in brisbane for it
[20:27] <Noskcaj> i will make the bugs ect. while i'm at the coast
[20:27] <balloons> do you know where?
[20:27] <balloons> against ubuntu-website
[20:27] <balloons> assign me to them
[20:27] <balloons> or sub me
[20:27] <balloons> actuakky
[20:27] <balloons> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-qa-website/+filebug
[20:29] <Noskcaj> ok, i will try and make them now
[20:29] <balloons> njin, I posted a dog pic, just for you :-)
[20:29] <njin> balloons, where ?
[20:30] <balloons> https://plus.google.com/104307250302998042813/posts/ZrqRY2EZWrK
[20:30] <letozaf_> naaa cute doggy !!!
[20:31] <njin> wonderfull
[20:31] <njin> really nice, thanks balloons
[20:32] <letozaf_> is he or she still a puppy ?
[20:32] <balloons> hey phillw
[20:32] <balloons> no, he's an "old man" now as my wife calls him
[20:32] <balloons> he'll be 4 next month

[20:32] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1096192 in Ubuntu QA Website "Iso tracker should have a ubiquity/kernal changelog similar to the one netboot has" [Undecided,New]
[20:32] <balloons> that is an older picture, so he looks a bit younger
[20:33] <letozaf_> :)
[20:35] <Noskcaj> good bye
[20:35] <balloons> so njin, can I add you now? :-p
[20:38] <dkessel> deja-dup is a duplicate
[20:38] <dkessel> on the trello page
[20:38] <letozaf_> I made the mess, le me cancel the one I inserted
[20:39] <balloons> lol
[20:39] <balloons> we both deleted it
[20:39] <balloons> moved it back
[20:40] <njin> balloons, sure
[20:40] <letozaf_> I see it in the "potential packages" column
[20:40] <balloons> move it to wherever, whatever
[20:40] <balloons> njin, did I get the right one?
[20:40] <njin> ;-P
[20:41] <njin> yes, I don't have a photo available now
[20:41] <letozaf_> gnome terminal has been kind of half done ...
[20:42] <balloons> probably should look and see what's in the branch
[21:04] <letozaf_> balloons, I cancelled all the TABS (sorry) from the terminal test
[21:05] <letozaf_> wanted to propose a merge only for that, but instead looks like there are all the tests in the branch I uploaded to my profile
[21:05] <balloons> I have tabs in some of my old stuff too
[21:05] <balloons> so don't worry :-)
[21:05] <balloons> I didn't mean to. I THINK everything should be 4 spaces now
[21:06] <balloons> I merged all your stuff
[21:06] <letozaf_> using gedit does not let you see the TABS
[21:06] <balloons> so you can update to trunk and then edit more if you wish
[21:06] <letozaf_> so I changed editor now
[21:06] <balloons> I use geany, but you have to set it to use spaces
[21:06] <letozaf_> I found SPE, but still trying to get used to it
[21:07] <balloons> ahh yes
[21:07] <balloons> vim and emacs are also options
[21:07] <balloons> I shudder to mention them, lol..
[21:11] <letozaf_> :)
[21:18]  * phillw is a nano fan, but will use vim when needed :)
[21:18] <balloons> ahh yes, YAO
[21:19] <phillw> vim does have checks that are useful when writing / editing stuff.
[21:20] <phillw> But, when not ssh'd into my server, I use Bluefish for CSS, (X)HTML etc.
[21:21] <letozaf_> I use vim to edit files when I use terminal but not to write code
[21:22] <phillw> letozaf_: indeed, when on a remote server I find vim / nano to suit my needs. But, the wonderful thing about Linux is that we can use whatever we prefer :D
[21:22] <letozaf_> thats right! :)
[21:24] <phillw> I tried various GUI editors, and found Bluefish best for me. I would never call one editor in either terminal or GUI 'better' than another, people should try several and settle with the one that they prefer :)
[21:24] <balloons> indeed
[21:24] <balloons> it's just text
[21:24] <balloons> so, phillw can I add you to do the board?
[21:24] <balloons> I updated this page, and archived the old stuff
[21:24] <phillw> balloons: which board?...
[21:24] <balloons> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/TestcaseUpdates
[21:25] <balloons> https://trello.com/board/autopilot-tests/50e735ad7351f0a64e00040c
[21:25] <balloons> did you miss the trello conversation>
[21:25] <balloons> ?
[21:25] <letozaf_> well maybe if you get something specific for the language you are using you can have some advantages, like see TABS  and remove them when not needed :)
[21:25] <letozaf_> using gedit with python didn't let me see the TABS for instance
[21:26] <letozaf_> I think I will try Bluefish with python and see how it goes
[21:27] <phillw> letozaf_: I'm not familiar with python, I can read it, but not write it :)
[21:27] <phillw> c / cc/ c+ is aking to klingon for me, though :P
[21:27] <balloons> haha
[21:27] <letozaf_> well neither am I :) but I'm learning :-D
[21:28] <letozaf_> I used to program in COBOL some years now :-D
[21:28] <phillw> I'm okay in PHP, MySQL, XHTML and CSS.... If it cannot be written in them, I ask some one to help :)
[21:28] <balloons> python is pretty friendly
[21:28] <letozaf_> yep
[21:29] <dkessel> letozaf_, you can enable display of whitespace in gedit using a plugin from the package gedit-plugins
[21:29] <balloons> at any rate.. what do you think of a board for the other "stuff" phillw?
[21:29] <balloons> and deprecate the wiki?
[21:29] <letozaf_> dkessel, thank you, maybe I will try
[21:31] <phillw> balloons: personally? I prefer wiki to be the 'gold' standard which holds the most up to date info. All other areas should point back to that. We did discuss this a couple of years ago within the Lubuntu community as we saught full recognition. As also now ubuntuforums has transferred / is transferring stuff from there to wiki I'd be uncomfortable with trying to keep multiple areas of reference up to date.
[21:32] <balloons> phillw, ohh I definitely agree on one spot for stuff.. so, it sounds like we don't need more workflow than what we have in the wiki for manual stuff?
[21:34] <phillw> for manual test cases, leave them there. As the auto stuff is developing then what ever is felt most useful for you guys, I'm totally okay with :D
[21:35] <balloons> phillw, yea, I wanted this to be on lp, but other teams said they did it this way
[21:35] <balloons> so we'll give it a whirl
[21:35] <balloons> ok, so my cleanup work stands then.. hehe
[21:37] <phillw> when I was a part of TheSII, the devs tried various systems for tracking development, assinging tasks etc. If you want, I can always enquire as to what they settled on. Not too sure if I can still get you all the google apps for such things for free owing to google changing the rules.
[21:39] <phillw> ohh, I can.... just needs the area to be registered in USA... I know a man who can do that :)
[21:41] <phillw> balloons: just let me know if you guys need some server space, my offer for it still stands and I currently have four ipV4 unique addresses sat idle :)
[21:44] <letozaf_> dkessel, thanks I got the plugin and it works fine :D
[21:46] <balloons> ty phillw
[21:59] <letozaf_> I'm going to bed, goodnight :D
[21:59] <balloons> good night
[22:00] <balloons> SergioMeneses, hey, we've got a trello board going now with the autopilot stuff
[22:00] <balloons> https://trello.com/board/autopilot-tests/50e735ad7351f0a64e00040c
[22:00] <thomi> alesage: did you get anywhere with the autopilot-gtk packaging?
[22:01] <alesage> hi thomi, I dput xpathselect and autopilot-gtk to raring in our ppa, haven't tested yet
[22:01] <thomi> sweet
[22:02] <thomi> I'm not actually here - just wanted to check, and baloons mention of 'autopilot' caught my eye :)
[22:02]  * thomi heads outside to enjoy the sunshine
[22:02] <balloons> thomi, heh
[22:02] <balloons> yes indeed
[22:02] <balloons> I'll ping you on monday
[22:02] <balloons> err your tuesday about it
