[12:02] <mb5> hi, I am toying around with bzr builder a bit and I have run into a small problem: the project that I am trying to have build has an upstream debian directory so I cannot just merge/nest my debian packaging branch or bzr will complain about conflicts and quit
[12:03] <mb5> I also cannot just "bzr rm" in the recipe because of locking issues
[12:03] <mb5> what would be the propper way to handle this problem
[12:03] <mb5> ?
[12:16] <ccxCZ> buildbot might help

[16:26] <pabs3> is there a way to tell if a remote repository exists without downloading the whole repository?

[23:31] <evillyEvil> How do I fix this error ConnectionReset reading response for 'BzrDir.open_2.1', retrying ?
[23:31] <evillyEvil> I was able to branch from launchpad just yesterday.
