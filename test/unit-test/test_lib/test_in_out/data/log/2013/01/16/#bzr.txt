[08:00] <trident_job> hey bzr users!
[08:03] <trident_job> Does someone use bzr in windows ?
[10:17] <gmarkall> i'm making use of bzr on an HPC system - when I load the bzr module on it, it adds the python2.6/site-packages/bzrlib folder to the PYTHONPATH. This causes issues since a few things in bzrlib have the same name as standard libraries (e.g. commands.py). Would I be correct in thinking that this is a bug in the module, and bzrlib shouldn't be on $PYTHONPATH?
[10:18] <lifeless> thats correct
[10:18] <lifeless> python2.6/site-packages should be on PYTHONPATH
[10:26] <gmarkall> lifeless: thanks :)
