[02:38] <snap-l> OK, so the cat is now spoiled
[02:39] <snap-l> One state-of-the-piddle litterbox
[02:39] <snap-l> and a sleepy corner
[02:55] <jhansonxi> snap-l, the PetSafe self-cleaning model?
[02:56] <jhansonxi> This is my review of it: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZLTN7EISR03L/ref=cm_cr_notf_fhv_prd
[02:57] <snap-l> no, http://littersystem.com
[02:59] <jhansonxi> Nifty but I like electronics.  I'm planning on adapting my PetSafe model for use with a 55-gallon drum for a waste container so I only have to empty it once a year.
[02:59] <snap-l> I wanted to get the Petsafe one, but I didn't have an outlet near the litter box
[02:59] <snap-l> also it looks pretty big
[03:00] <snap-l> I remember reading this review. :)
[03:01] <jhansonxi> It is big.
[03:03] <jjesse-home> greg-g: congrats on the new job
[03:03] <jjesse-home> just read the blog post
[03:03] <jhansonxi> "electronics" is a bit of a stretch.  It's just an LED, a couple of gearmotors, and safety switches.  I might add a micro just so I can load Android on it.  That way I can graph cat output.
[04:30] <greg-g> jjesse-home: thanks! :)
[04:32] <greg-g> so, what do people think of the Dell XPS? That's standard issue at WMF apparently
[04:45] <greg-g> is this a thing now? "Co-Founder / Co-CEO"
[12:59] <snap-l> jcastro: Good God, you're all over this extinct animals reddit. ;)
[13:11] <JonEdney> o/ all.  Some weather around here eh?
[13:11] <JonEdney> Can't remember the last time I opened my window and listened to a thunderstorm roll by in January.
[13:15] <rick_h_> yea, fun times
[13:15] <snap-l> Yeah, it's quite wacky
[13:15] <snap-l> later today we're suppsed to see snow
[13:15] <rick_h_> Blazeix: snap-l widox jcastro and such early edition CHC 7pm tonight

[13:16] <snap-l> Isn't that what you call your Leopold Cherry Blue?
[13:17] <rick_h_> ah, gotcha

[15:27] <greg-g> g'morn
[15:27] <greg-g> today feels like a new day :)
[15:27] <rick_h_> wheee
[15:28] <snap-l> It should. The calendar says it is
[15:29] <brousch> greg-g: Free from the stress of CC?
[15:35] <greg-g> brousch: yeppers :)
[15:36] <brousch> And you can eat again!
[15:37]  * snap-l waits for the "A plea from Greg Grossmeier" ad on Wikipedia
[15:42] <greg-g> snap-l: I was interviewed for that, and my photo was taken (a few times) but I didn't make the cut (this was Oct '11)
[15:42] <rick_h_> lol
[15:43] <brousch> Too beardy?
[15:43] <rick_h_> they thought he was just trying to raise new bike funds
[15:44] <rick_h_> ok, what kind of technical architect says the answer to deploying to production LTS is "just download the binary since the package is too old"
[15:44] <rick_h_> ?!
[15:45] <brousch> The kind that enjoys inviting the wrath of rick_h_?
[15:46] <rick_h_> I mean $#@$ not even raring has the version of the package we need and rather than shove the feature the answer is to download a pre-compiled binary of the latest
[15:47] <brousch> Maybe he's trolling!
[15:56] <snap-l> rick_h_: What the fuck?
[15:56] <snap-l> No, that's just stupipd
[15:57] <snap-l> That's asking for trouble, tecnhical debt, and goes against everything I ever learned about sysadmin
[15:57] <rick_h_> yea, just ranting
[15:57] <snap-l> Re-roll the package
[15:57] <snap-l> but DON'T just download a fucking binary
[16:03] <shakes808> snap-l: Not much. Just dealing with legal. :-\
[16:03] <shakes808> GO NY!!! lol
[16:08] <rick_h_> NY?
[16:09] <shakes808> I am working on the NY roll out. We are starting to do lending in NY here at Shore Mortgage / United Shore Fianacial ...blah blah blah. I am sick of this lol.
[16:09] <shakes808> They wanted it done in Nov and here we are going into Feb and not near completion
[16:09] <shakes808> lol
[16:10] <rick_h_> NY = new york?
[16:10] <shakes808> correct
[16:10] <rick_h_> gotcha
[16:10] <snap-l> I thought it was a sportball reference
[16:10] <shakes808> ? Sportball?
[16:11] <rick_h_> <3 sportball
[16:11] <shakes808> ?Football?
[16:11] <shakes808> lol
[16:11] <snap-l> Any sport
[16:11] <shakes808> haha
[16:11] <rick_h_> sportball == catch all for non-sports geeks
[16:11] <shakes808> gotcha
[16:12] <shakes808> So rick_h, SF or B?

[16:16] <greg-g> rick_h_: man, btw, I really wish you had bookie.net/com/org/whatever, just saying ;)
[16:16] <snap-l> Yeah, yry doing a google search for bookie sometime
[16:17]  * rick_h_ sighs
[16:17] <rick_h_> I can get bookie.bz, only one I can see
[16:17] <greg-g> yuck
[16:17] <snap-l> You should register notafuckinggamblingsite.com
[16:17] <shakes808> I tried to log into bookie last night, but couldn't :( WTF lol
[16:17] <snap-l> and then have it redirect to bookie. ;)
[16:18] <rick_h_> shakes808: did you go through forgot login?
[16:18] <greg-g> book.ie would have been perfect ;)
[16:18] <shakes808> lol na, just said meh lol
[16:18] <shakes808> using User Logic
[16:18] <shakes808> :D
[16:18] <shakes808> Swear and yell at my computer for being stooped
[16:19] <rick_h_> greg-g: hmm, gandi says "reserved for corporate services" wtf that means
[16:20] <rick_h_> where is .ie?
[16:20] <rick_h_> bookie.am
[16:21] <greg-g> ireland
[16:21] <rick_h_> bookie.cx
[16:21] <rick_h_> oh hmm, bookie.fm?
[16:21] <rick_h_> bookie.gg
[16:21] <rick_h_> lol
[16:21] <greg-g> haha
[16:21] <rick_h_> oh, I like bookie.io
[16:21] <greg-g> should be my personal tld ;)
[16:22] <jrwren> http://bit.ly/WQrVPE  <-- i just sent that to someone when they replied "waht is that" after I said "there is coffee house coders tongiht"
[16:22] <jrwren> am i bad?
[16:23] <rick_h_> lol
[16:23] <rick_h_> bah, hate this rename. Oh well. my own fault I guess
[16:23] <rick_h_> love that detroit is right there at the top
[16:23] <rick_h_> gah
[16:24] <greg-g> jrwren: lmgtfy is great, every now and then ;)
[16:28] <rick_h_> greg-g: well bought bookie.io, though my ssl cert and all that isn't setup for it
[16:28] <rick_h_> greg-g: so might be a bit before I look to change over I guess.
[16:28] <widox> rick_h_: they haven't updated the chc website for ours though
[16:29] <rick_h_> widox: yea, I think they still want us to add it
[16:29] <rick_h_> I looked and they want to setup a subdomain and have us add in the template into the node app
[16:29] <rick_h_> which is in that funky format I hate
[16:29] <rick_h_> I should look at breaking down and doing that else setup our own static site
[16:29] <widox> oh, are they finally moving to the node app instead of GAP?
[16:29] <rick_h_> they said they would redirect the subdomain if we wanted. Tempted to put up a s3 simple site
[16:30] <rick_h_> widox: yea, it's a diff domain I think
[16:30] <widox> why are they making it so complicated?
[16:30] <widox> gah
[16:30] <snap-l> Should just make our own site, frankly
[16:30] <snap-l> and ask for a cname
[16:30] <rick_h_> because, they're AA peeps
[16:31] <rick_h_> snap-l: ok, we'll make it a topic for tonight's meeting
[16:31] <rick_h_> :P
[16:31] <widox> I was actually thinking we should whip up something less janky for it. that nested frame GAP thing is junk
[16:31] <rick_h_> I like the idea of consistant theming
[16:31] <rick_h_> yea, true :(
[16:31] <snap-l> rick_h_: I'm OK with that. ;)
[16:31] <rick_h_> 'we really don't suck this bad...promise'
[16:33] <rick_h_> damn people need to come do some of my work since they've got too much time on their hands https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/296492713061265408
[16:33] <greg-g> rick_h_: wow, you're quick, and take my complaints too seriously :) But that'll be good, yeah
[16:33] <rick_h_> greg-g: well I liked it
[16:34] <rick_h_> and I have wanted a better domain, but hover doesn't list it
[16:34] <greg-g> good :)
[16:34] <rick_h_> so gandi has more extensions since they're more internationally tied in
[16:40]  * greg-g nods
[16:40]  * greg-g loves ghandi
[16:40] <greg-g> -h
[16:40] <rick_h_> felt like I was signing my life away
[16:40] <rick_h_> three diff checkboxes of terms to agree to
[16:46] <snap-l> Yeah, they tend to make you more aware of what you're agreeing to than most
[16:47] <snap-l> At least it isn't Godaddy, though
[16:48] <snap-l> "Would you like the anti-not-privacy enabled for an additional $5 per domain, or the not-anti-value-privacy disabled for $10 per domain"
[16:48] <snap-l> "Would you like us to SEO you CEO for an additonal $79 per domain"
[16:49] <snap-l> "Would you like not to disable the not-exactly-a-shopping cart for $99 per domain"
[16:58] <jrwren> not to mention that the godaddy TOS says that they own the domain that you just paid for and they are letting you use it.
[16:58] <jrwren> they can take it from you at any time for any reason.
[16:59] <greg-g> do all registrars? or do you know if others don't
[17:00] <jrwren> that is a godaddy specific thing
[17:00] <jrwren> well, others might, but mine does not, nor does many others
[17:02] <greg-g> good to know
[17:02] <greg-g> I could conceiveable see that being a standard thing
[17:08] <jrwren> dnsimple <3
[17:09] <rick_h_> bah, can't tell if they have .io and such domains
[17:10] <snap-l> Who, gandi?
[17:10] <rick_h_> https://dnsimple.com/tld-pricing
[17:10] <rick_h_> found it, just took a bit
[17:11] <rick_h_> you can't just start searching without an account like others
[20:11] <snap-l> rick_h_: Webapp requiring NFS? What the fuck?
[20:11] <rick_h_> heh, ask me at CHC
[20:11] <rick_h_> what a day
[20:11] <rick_h_> I'm about to run out to the garage to beat out some tension :)
[20:12] <snap-l> The thought of anything requiring NFS and not being filesystem agnostic is perplexing
[20:12] <rick_h_> add HA onto that as well :P
[20:12] <snap-l> high availability and NFS are mutually erxclusive
[20:13] <snap-l> Seriously, buy a SAN if you need HA
[21:05] <jrwren> SANs suck.
[21:06] <jrwren> never buy a san :p
[21:06] <jrwren> indeed the thought of anything requiring NFS and not being fs agnostic is perplexing
[21:08] <jcastro> CEPH BABY
[21:10] <jrwren> CEPH is sweet.
[21:10] <jrwren> but I'd prefer the s3 API to CEPH so I could target other file stores too.
[21:11] <jrwren> ceph radosgw s3gw plz. k ty.
[21:11] <jcastro> sure, but you wouldn't use ceph by itself, you'd have openstack provide that api for you
[21:11] <jcastro> (or whatever)
[21:11] <jrwren> ceph radosgw is alternative to teh default provided openstack s3 compat storage
[21:11] <jrwren> so you'd choose whichever works best for you.
[21:11] <jcastro> nod
[21:23] <jcastro> man, I don't know how I lived without eneloops rick_h_
[21:26] <jrwren> eneloops?
[21:31] <rick_h_> jcastro: woot
[21:31] <rick_h_> jrwren: http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-Eneloop-Charger-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B003VLAEPQ/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1359581488&sr=8-5&keywords=eneloop
[21:54] <jrwren> oh yes, eneloop, I use those too
[21:54] <jrwren> great bats
