[09:21] <mesquka1> Hi
[09:31] <jea> hello
[09:31] <mesquka1> Is this channel active?
[09:31] <mesquka1> I'm going afk for awhile
[09:32] <jea> yes, it is active
[09:32] <jea> the number of people in it varies greatly though
[11:59] <mesquka1> My Ubuntu Box is down for now, power surge, have replaced motherboard and graphics card, have to replace PSU, CPU and RAM.
[12:00] <mesquka1> HDD has seprate surge protection so is still operational
[12:00] <jea> that is a fairly big change to go through
[12:04] <mesquka1> :D
[12:05] <mesquka1> Lightning strike *sigh* stuck with my crappy university macbook air
[12:06] <jea> is it an old mba?
[12:11] <mesquka1> FUS ROH DAH at shopkeeper, run away with intel i7 extreme, mba's a 2012 model. 11-inch bought at the start of this year. 2GB Ram 1333Mhz (honestly, the slowest possible, at least 1600MHz!), i5 1.6GHz CPU, Intel 3000 288mb integrated graphics, 1366x768...... you get the idea.
[12:12] <mesquka1> What about you?
[12:13] <mesquka1> edit: last year :D
[12:13] <jea> i have one of the mba june 2012 models - 13in
[12:13] <jea> 4gb ram, but that seems fine
[12:14] <jea> after using a june 2012 mb pro 13in, i really see the benefit of a ssd
[12:14] <jea> so much faster
[12:14] <jea> but, this is a ubuntu channel, so i shouldn't get distracted by macs :P
[12:16] <jea> you mentioned uni - are you currently at uni? what are you doing?
[12:16] <mesquka1> Yeah, Computer Sciences and Engineering
[12:17] <mesquka1> I joined the ubuntu australia team :P
[12:17] <jea> ok. i am also at uni, doing engineering (software and aerospace)
[12:17] <jea> ah, i thought i recognised the name
[12:17] <jea> I see that Jared sorted you out with joining
[12:18] <mesquka1> yeah
[12:18] <jea> how far through your course are you?
[12:18] <mesquka1> I'm going more toward software design and programming, about 2 year in, its a 4 year course
[12:19] <jea> ok, sounds much the same as me. i have also just finished year 2 of 4 years
[12:19] <mesquka1> ok
[12:20] <jea> been using ubuntu for long?
[12:20] <mesquka1> ubuntu, no, linux, yes
[12:20] <mesquka1> used to use openSUSE
[12:20] <jea> right
[12:21] <jea> well i offer a warm welcome to the Ubuntu Australian Team
[12:21] <jea> this channel can be quiet - unfortunately people are getting busier and are not on as much
[12:22] <jea> but every so often it picks up
[12:28] <jea> so what is it that you are working on developing with Swurl?
[12:49] <mesquka1> Right now I'm assigned to the dev team for chatterbox, a social networking platform we're working on. It's based on the Nooku framework.
[12:50] <jea> is that a uni project?
[12:51] <mesquka1> Sort of
[12:51] <jea> i must say i find joomla quite annoying
[12:51] <jea> but maybe it has got better in the last few versions
[12:52] <mesquka1> Yeah, the code is a bit blocky
[12:52] <mesquka1> not really well structured and hard to understand
[12:52] <jea> i ended up switching to drupal due to how bad joomla was at the time
[12:52] <jea> quite glad i did
[12:52] <mesquka1> :D
[12:53] <jea> how many are in the group working on it?
[12:54] <mesquka1> I know what you mean, I just use Joomla because of Nooku framework
[12:54] <jea> yeah
[12:54] <jea> is nooku good?
[12:54] <mesquka1> I find it's a pretty stable base
[12:55] <mesquka1> almost no bugs
[12:55] <mesquka1> Chatterbox is almost done, next is a forum.
[12:55] <jea> it is up on the web anywhere?
[12:56] <mesquka1> http://chatterbox.openswurl.com
[12:56] <mesquka1> I'm currently using XMB for the forum
[12:56] <mesquka1> I'm going to fork XMB
[12:57] <mesquka1> Like how I forked Nooku/Joomla
[12:57] <jea> can't say i have used xmb
[12:57] <jea> but i (luckily, i think) haven't done much forum stuff
[12:58] <mesquka1> Not a very user friendly interface, but pretty stable, first thing I want to do is give the GUI a makeover.
[12:58] <mesquka1> Forum's and Social Platforms are pretty similar
[12:58] <jea> using bootstrap?
[12:58] <jea> yeah, they are
[12:58] <jea> i just don't like dealing with some of the forum adminstration
[12:59] <jea> mainly the setting up initially
[12:59] <mesquka1> Ahhh, the forum and social networks had quite a bit of spam and porn up. Had to create a spam/profanity filter
[13:00] <jea> i can imagine
[13:00] <mesquka1> Some guy using a VPS hosted perl script
[13:00] <jea> do you have many people using your network?
[13:00] <mesquka1> no
[13:00] <mesquka1> I did but the porn scared them off
[13:00] <jea> ah
[13:01] <mesquka1> *sigh
[13:01] <mesquka1> *sigh*
[13:01] <jea> you can also /me
[13:01] <jea> but i am sure you know that already
[13:01] <mesquka1> yeah i do
[13:02] <mesquka1> I've been using freenode for quite awhile
[13:02] <jea> i expected so
[13:02] <jea> it is just that i have come across some people who have been using irc for a long time who didn't know about it somehow
[13:02] <mesquka1> Damn spammers!!!! although I can't talk, my early teenage years were filled with questionable activity
[13:02] <jea> haha
[13:03] <mesquka1> haha
[13:03] <mesquka1> hey jea, you been in the Ubuntu AU team for long?
[13:04] <jea> it has been a few years
[13:05] <jea> i started using this channel and getting involved in the team moreso the last year or two
[13:05] <mesquka1> I have been quite active on the KDE team
[13:05] <jea> i now help to run the monthly team meetings, as well as the social media presence
[13:06] <jea> which kde team is that?
[13:07] <mesquka1> KDE Core team
[13:07] <jea> right
[13:07] <jea> i haven't tried KDE for quite a while
[13:07] <mesquka1> Release team really, the core team is kind of hard to define
[13:07] <jea> some teams are like that
[13:08] <mesquka1> There's no registration as such, just purly merit based.
[13:08] <jea> yep
[13:08] <jea> this team works like that in a way
[13:09] <mesquka1> I sort of broke in by kind of being the first to create a (sort of) stable port (ok, unstable, not for everyday use but usable) of Krita and Karbon.
[13:10] <jea> were they not available?
[13:10] <mesquka1> I can't believe no one thought of using QT4-X11 instead of QT4-MAC
[13:11] <mesquka1> no they aren't
[13:11] <mesquka1> No KDE developer has a mac with the exception of me
[13:12] <jea> so you are making these apps for Mac, or for Kubuntu/KDE?
[13:13] <mesquka1> what apps?
[13:13] <mesquka1> Krita?
[13:13] <jea> yes
[13:14] <mesquka1> I develop them for openSUSE and Fedora.
[13:14] <jea> so where does the mac come in?
[13:14] <mesquka1> I maintain the .rpm's.
[13:15] <jea> (i probably just haven't read it well enough)
[13:15] <mesquka1> The mac was just because community members on the forums seemed pretty keen on a port, so I just did a bit of a side project
[13:15] <mesquka1> It's not an official port yet
[13:16] <mesquka1> But because it's been ported perhaps someone might decide to start on a few bug patches and it will become official
[13:17] <jea> so you made a mac port of those apps, then got into the dev team, and became the rpm maintainer?
[13:19] <mesquka1> I was already on the release dev team and maintaining the .rpm packages
[13:20] <jea> ok
[13:20] <mesquka1> I got on to that team because of my work on bug patches for those platforms
[13:20] <jea> i should do that some day
[13:20] <jea> the main problem is having time to do it
[13:20] <mesquka1> I got into the core team because of the mac port
[13:21] <mesquka1> time? right now I have plenty of it.
[13:21] <jea> ah. i think i have got it now
[13:21] <jea> due to uni holidays?
[13:22] <mesquka1> Not really, just that this actually counts as uni work in the courses I'm doing and I get to work on these teams while I'm at it
[13:23] <jea> That sounds pretty good
[13:23] <jea> we don't really have much like that from what I know
[13:23] <mesquka1> I left KDE because the the central council make too many of the important decisions and doesn't let the community have enough input, but aside from that
[13:24] <jea> hi sagaci 
[13:24] <mesquka1> its pretty open
[13:24] <mesquka1> Hi sagaci
[13:25] <mesquka1> Jea, can you please explain to me how the team works?
[13:25] <jea> Jared is the Team Contact and Team Leader
[13:26] <jea> (the official title could be slightly different - haven't checked for a bit)
[13:26] <jea> anyone can join the team, as long as they are australian
[13:26] <mesquka1> So he basically makes the official decisions?
[13:26] <jea> everyone can run an event, help out with anything happening
[13:27] <mesquka1> Nice
[13:27] <jea> in a way, but it is not too formal really
[13:27] <mesquka1> I prefer to work that way, I like it being open
[13:28] <jea> basically you get given more permission to do things once he and others get to know you
[13:28] <mesquka1> although I'm in perth, not sure weather I can really participate in any events
[13:28] <jea> Jared is in Brisbane, as am I
[13:28] <mesquka1> Thats understandable
[13:28] <mesquka1> Ok
[13:28] <jea> sagaci is in NSW
[13:28] <mesquka1> got to keep out spammers
[13:28] <mesquka1> :D
[13:29] <jea> yeah, in a way
[13:29] <sagaci> 4:30am for ubuntu announcement
[13:29] <jea> ah, i forgot about that
[13:29] <jea> not sure if i can last that long
[13:29] <sagaci> touch screen something it seems like
[13:29] <mesquka1> I can't
[13:29] <jea> is that 4:30 AEDT?
[13:29] <mesquka1> Got to sleep
[13:30] <mesquka1> Too many new years (eve) parties
[13:30] <mesquka1> 2 days no sleep
[13:30] <jea> haha
[13:30] <mesquka1> I will check up on it later
[13:31] <jea> maybe if i keep watching the tennis
[13:31] <mesquka1> :D
[13:31] <jea> but another 4.5hrs is probably too long for me
[13:31] <mesquka1> anyway, bye, im going afk
[13:32] <jea> bye for now. nice speaking to you :)
[13:45] <mesquka> I will be on tomorrow all day in five minute sessions in between other things :D
[13:46] <mesquka> so 5 on and about 30 off kind of
[13:46] <mesquka> bye
[13:56] <sagaci> mesquka: bye
