[01:05] <ScottL> hello everyone :)
[01:41] <falktx_> hello
[01:57] <micahg> hi ScottL 
[01:58] <len-1304> ScottL, synfigstudio is relatively small. You could try it. Have you run it on 13.04 alpha to test it?
[01:59] <len-1304> Hi micahg, Thankyou for updating icons. I saw it download. today on my 13.04 system.
[02:00] <len-1304> (so you must have uploaded it)
[02:02] <len-1304> ScottL, with reguard to synfigstudio, it pulls in oss-compat, we would really need to find out if it would break anything sound wise.
[02:03] <len-1304> ScottL, both with Jack and Pulse.
[02:03] <ScottL> len-1304, i have tried it, i like it quite a bit better than kdenlive for certain things
[02:04] <ScottL> synfig uses blines which allows you to spline paths for objects to move, kdenlive doesn't allow that
[02:04] <len-1304> When it is running, can jack still run?
[02:04] <ScottL> i want to add it to the graphics/video seeds
[02:04] <ScottL> i don't think it affects jack or jack affects it at all
[02:04] <len-1304> Why does it need OSS then?
[02:06] <ScottL> hmmm, not sure. that is weird
[02:06] <len-1304> OSS doesn't show up on the depends.
[02:08] <len-1304> Ah! it is a recomends of libdv-bin. So synfig doesn't use it directly
[02:09] <ScottL> okay, that makes since. i really haven't even tried audio on synfig. i'm not even sure it does audio at all even :P
[02:11] <len-1304> libdv includes sample programs for viewing and inserting audio into a dv stream.
[02:11] <len-1304> I think that so long as the user doesn't use those programs OSS doesn't get used.
[02:11] <ScottL> a quick google search says sometime aobut synfix and audio, but it doesn't look like it's a very mature audio use though
[02:12] <ScottL> s/sometime/something
[02:13] <len-1304> synfig doesn't seem to use Oss though, just a sample program that comes with one of the libs
[02:13] <len-1304> If the lib comes with OSS sample programs, how old are the sample programs?  :)
[02:13] <ScottL> hehe, yeah that is a funny consideration
[02:14] <ScottL> rebooting
[02:14] <len-1304> CUL

[13:49] <scott-work> good morning everyone
[13:49] <smartboyhw> Good evening scott-work 
[13:49]  * scott-work had a lot of trouble with nickserv this morning :(
[13:49] <smartboyhw> scott-work, I had a slow bandwidth today, weird
[13:49]  * scott-work routinely experiences trouble with webchat as well
[13:49] <smartboyhw> scott-work, LOL
[13:49] <scott-work> how are you smartboyhw 
[13:49] <smartboyhw> scott-work, fione
[13:50] <smartboyhw> s/fione/fine
[13:50] <scott-work> oh, i saw in -community-team channel that it seems like team reports _are_ still in favor, i was going to start picking those up again
[13:51] <smartboyhw> scott-work, good:D
[14:17] <smartboyhw> len-1304, scott-work astraljava  zequence next UDS is in oakland. Wanna join?
[14:17] <scott-work> smartboyhw: i believe i will be going to this uds again. this makes scott happy :)
[14:18] <smartboyhw> scott-work, I'm not happy.
[14:21] <scott-work> i do admit this is very us/center-europe centric and i understand you would be unhappy
[14:22] <scott-work> there are some very tech heavy asian cities, i'm kinda surprised there hasn't been one in HK or Japan or elsewhere
[14:23] <smartboyhw> scott-work, yes:*
[14:23] <smartboyhw> ****
[14:24] <smartboyhw> scott-work, status report:P
[14:24] <scott-work> perhaps a bunch of pan-asian people should create a list of proposed cities/hotels and create a referendum (or some other signed document) and politely suggest this to canonical for consideration for the next non-us uds
[14:25] <smartboyhw> v
[14:25] <smartboyhw> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-raring/group/topic-raring-flavor-ubuntustudio.html
[14:25] <smartboyhw> scott-work, I wouldf
[14:25] <smartboyhw> We did good in iso and video
[14:25] <scott-work> i just looked this morning at that and assigned a new batch of work to myself, i plan to get quiet a few things done, we aren't tracking so well at this point
[14:26] <smartboyhw> scott-work, actually we are the second best along all flavors:P
[14:26] <scott-work> i noticed that as well on status.ubuntu.com (along with the total falling behind on the burn down chart), makes me wonder if this is a result from skaet being removed
[14:27] <smartboyhw> scott-work, oh?
[14:27] <smartboyhw> Weird reason
[14:28] <scott-work> well, here is how i see it....
[14:28] <smartboyhw> K
[14:28] <scott-work> (please realize this is tenuous and i'm probably wrong on a few facts)
[14:28] <smartboyhw> OK
[14:29] <scott-work> i don't remember status.ubuntu.com being popular before skaet came, and i believe that she stressed using it as a metric
[14:29] <scott-work> i don't believe she is leading the releases anymore
[14:29] <scott-work> and we seem to not be tracking very well
[14:29] <smartboyhw> scott-work, you're right. One fact IS wrong:P (half of it)
[14:29] <scott-work> of course this could simply be because people are not updating the blueprints very well without prompting and we are actually tracking _very_ well, just not reporting
[14:30] <scott-work> oh good, better than i expected ;)
[14:30] <smartboyhw> Does https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseTaskSignup count as skaet still leading the releases?
[14:31] <smartboyhw> At least one:P
[14:31] <smartboyhw> scott-work, ^^
[14:31] <smartboyhw> Clearly though, Adam Conrad is getting the most important jobs
[14:31] <scott-work> well, i meant more of a "hold the meeting, remind everyone to do stuff"
[14:32] <smartboyhw> scott-work, ah OK. The problem is, THERE IS NO MEETING
[14:32] <scott-work> yeah, i suspected adam might be taking a bigger role, i say that because i roomed with last UDS in oakland and we talked quite a bit one night
[14:32] <smartboyhw> And that IS a problem
[14:32] <scott-work> well, i think people in important places felt like the meeting was a waste of time for many people with little yield
[14:32] <scott-work> those people thought that the emails were just fine
[14:33] <smartboyhw> And they don't send emails
[14:33] <scott-work> of course, this may be true for the core groups....perhaps not
[14:33] <smartboyhw> scott-work, time to put in my exam results into LibreOffice Calc:P
[14:34] <scott-work> hehe, good luck
[14:35] <smartboyhw> scott-work, actually it's quite good
[14:35] <smartboyhw> Improvement:D
[14:36] <scott-work> oh, i meant finding out your final grade, not a comment on libre office ;)
[14:36] <smartboyhw> scott-work, well I will find it out on 31th Jan
[14:53] <astraljava> smartboyhw: Thanks, but I don't think I'll have a chance this time.
[14:53] <smartboyhw> astraljava, oh
[14:53] <scott-work> smartboyhw: did they say when uds is schedule?
[14:53] <smartboyhw> scott-work, may
[14:53] <scott-work> i need to fill out vacation request at work
[14:53] <scott-work> smartboyhw: dates?
[14:54] <smartboyhw> Not exactly dates
[14:54] <astraljava> Unless I'll win in a lottery, I'm most likely gonna have to work.
[14:54] <smartboyhw> scott-work, Jono Bacon just leaked it at yesterday's community meeting
[14:54] <smartboyhw> How do I know?
[15:15] <scott-work> i had asked in the community channel after the community council meeting, plea asked jono, who mentioned may and oakland but no other specifics
[15:17] <smartboyhw> scott-work, I know exactly as much as you know:P
[15:25] <scott-work> hehe
[15:25] <scott-work> i've been rethinking what ubuntu studio's mission and audience should be
[15:26] <scott-work> i think we can honestly and with integrity strive to be a real option for a recording studio
[15:31] <smartboyhw> scott-work, :)
[15:32] <scott-work> i like exploring these things because it also helps create goals with easily definable tasks
[15:33] <smartboyhw> Yay
[15:33] <scott-work> this is analogous to if a question is properly defined and structured, then you will have the majority of the answer already defined as well
[21:03] <zequence> tete_: Hi :)
[21:03] <tete_> hi
[21:04] <zequence> So, as I was saying, we're quite a small team. We do everything from writing documentation, selecting software, developing software, kernel maintenance, PR, etc
[21:04] <zequence> We're currently working off a blueprint https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/topic-raring-flavor-ubuntustudio
[21:05] <zequence> That page shows the blueprints for the coming 13.04 release
[21:05] <zequence> This involves more than just the coming release https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntustudio/+spec/topic-flavor-ubuntustudio
[21:07] <zequence> tete_: How it works is quite simple. If you feel something interests you in particular, or you have ideas, or whatever, you just start working on that. 
[21:07] <zequence> I'm putting together some developer documentation, but it's not ready yet
[21:07] <zequence> The idea is we try get more people involved
[21:08] <tete_> i just wanted to start with creating a new wiki page but it complains that i am not allowed to create that page (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RocksmithUSBCableAndUbuntuStudio?action=edit) 
[21:09] <zequence> tete_: You're logged in? 
[21:09] <tete_> jop
[21:09] <zequence> Did you confirm your email, etc?
[21:09] <zequence> This is the developer docs I'm working on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/DeveloperDocumentation
[21:09] <tete_> i confirmed the account, yes, and it shows "logout" on the top of the page
[21:10] <zequence> tete_: I'm not meaning to overwhelm you or anything. Just showing you some pages, so you get a bit of a broader picture of what we do. 
[21:10] <zequence> hmm
[21:10] <zequence> tete_: I created it https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RocksmithUSBCableAndUbuntuStudio
[21:11] <zequence> I don't have special privileges though
[21:11] <zequence> Just a normal account
[21:14] <zequence> tete_: I added a link for it on the howto page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/HowTos
[21:14] <zequence> Refresh your browser to see it
[21:14] <zequence> Ah, wait..
[21:15] <zequence> Right, now it's ok
[21:16] <tete_> thx :)
[21:17] <tete_> hm but still not allowed to edit 
[21:18] <zequence> tete_: Try loggin out and in again. May be some weird thing with the account
[21:20] <tete_> hm no still the same 
[21:22] <zequence> tete_: I suppose you click on the "edit" button. What is the error message?
[21:23] <tete_> You are not allowed to edit this page. 
[21:25] <zequence> tete_: Is your password 8 characters or more?
[21:26] <tete_> jop
[21:26] <zequence> Ah, that's not it, anyway
[21:32] <zequence> tete_: I can't figure out what it is. Seems like someone else had the same problem recently
[21:32] <zequence> Maybe they've changed something
[21:32] <tete_> hm ok
[21:33] <zequence> tete_: There's a small chance you need to start a launchpad page or something. Right now, I'm not able to find a good channel to aks about it. I will want to know why this is not working also, so will check it out
[21:34] <tete_> brb
[21:42] <zequence> tete: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WikiGuide/Registration
[21:42] <zequence> Didn't realize you needed that
[21:43] <tete> hm i have a launchpad acc. as i post pretty much bug reports for ubuntu and other software 
[21:43] <tete> will try to login with that 
[21:50] <tete> hm not working... even with my launchpad account
[21:57] <zequence> tete: I'm asking around. If I found out what's wrong, I'll let you know :)
[21:57] <tete> ok 
[21:58] <zequence> tete: Did you sign the code of conduct?
[21:58] <zequence> For the launchpad profile
[22:01] <tete> sorry what do you mean with "sign the code of conduct" ?
[22:01] <tete> my english is not the best 
[22:01] <tete> ah
[22:01] <tete>     2009-07-28
[22:01] <tete> Signed Ubuntu Code of Conduct:
[22:01] <tete>     No Sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct 
[22:01] <tete> does this make problems? 
[22:09] <zequence> tete: I don't know. Could be
[22:09] <zequence> I can't think of anything else right now :)
[22:10] <tete> ok i will create a pgp cert tomorrow 
[22:10] <tete> and then sign that code of conduct and if its working, i now what was the problem
[22:11] <zequence> tete: Anyway, feel free to hang out here. We are all volunteers working with Ubuntu Studio. If you like, you could subscribe to the ubuntu-studio-devel mail list also. And if you feel like helping out, just let us know
[22:12] <tete> jop
[22:42] <ttoine> hello
