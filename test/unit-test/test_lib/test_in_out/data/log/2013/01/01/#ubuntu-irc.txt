[00:13] <bazhang> JoseeAntonioR, you need the chanserv.py ?
[00:13] <JoseeAntonioR> bazhang: nope, just wanted to answer his question
[00:13] <bazhang> might want to ping Seveas if you cannot find it
[00:13] <JoseeAntonioR> but it seems I use the github one
[00:14] <IdleOne> it's on github
[00:14] <Unit193> bazhang: I wanted to have ubottu and the wiki using the same source.
[00:14] <bazhang> Unit193, perhaps ask tsimpson or jussi about that
[00:15] <Unit193> As the link on the site use a round-about way getting to the github page, and that link in the wiki 404'd, I changed the wiki to use github as well.
