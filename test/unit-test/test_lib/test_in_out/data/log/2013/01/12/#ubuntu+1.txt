[05:17] <gnomefreak> how do i stop gnome from asking for my password once gnome loads?
[05:30] <dniMretsaM> gnomefreak: that would be the GNOME keyring thing, I believe
[05:30] <dniMretsaM> you can probably disable it through autostart or services or whatever GNOME uses (I'm a KDE user)
[05:32] <gnomefreak> dniMretsaM: yes
[05:33] <gnomefreak> unless kde has changed i found it too simular to winblows
[05:33] <dniMretsaM> the default layout is quite similar to windows. but KDE is super customizable. my current setup would make a Windows user run for mommy. but I digress

[06:31] <soc> hi
[06:31] <gnomefreak> hi
[06:31] <soc> i'm wondering how to update to 13.04 from 12.10
[06:31] <soc> older releases suggested sudo update-manager -d, but this doesn't seem to work
[06:31] <soc> is there a new recomended way?
[06:33] <gnomefreak> soc: i dont suggest it until update-manager is fixed so you dont run into too many problems
[06:33] <soc> ok, so this is abug?
[06:33] <gnomefreak> oh and the command is update-m,anager -d. no need to use sudo
[06:34] <gnomefreak> soc: not a bug just not updated for 12.10 13.04

[14:42] <freeaks> hi there
[14:43] <freeaks> i have troubles getting my retina 15" to use the intel discrete chip, i'm using ubuntu 13.04 (kernel 3.8) atm
[14:44] <kubuntuser> freeaks: are u in wireless ?
[14:44] <kubuntuser> on a daily iso ?
[14:44] <freeaks> lspci return only the nvidia chip, i used to be able to see both intel and nvidia chip listed
[14:45] <freeaks> kubuntuser, i use usb to ethernet adapter, wireless is a bit unreliable
[14:45] <kubuntuser> freeaks: because wireless for me doesn't work today
[14:45] <BluesKaj> freeaks, Optimus ?
[14:45] <freeaks> yes i installed from a daily iso amd64 + mac
[14:46] <freeaks> BluesKaj, here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12451465#post12451465
[14:46] <freeaks> the last post, i pasted the result of lscpi
[14:46] <freeaks> lspci
[14:46] <freeaks> i used to be able to see both chip listed but now i can only see the nvidia one
[14:47] <freeaks> and no vgaswitcheroo in /sys/kernel/debug either
[14:47] <freeaks> do i have to recompile my kernel ?
[14:47] <freeaks> i tryed to pass lots of various kernel options from grub nothing worked so far
[14:48] <freeaks> (like modeset=1 etc ..)
[14:48] <BluesKaj> freeaks, what type of machine , laptoip desktop , tablet ?
[14:48] <freeaks> BluesKaj, apple macbookpro retina 15"
[14:49] <freeaks> the one with intel and nvidia hybrid gfx
[14:49] <BluesKaj> uhoh , that's a tough one
[14:50] <kubuntuser> please help me to solve wireless problem
[14:50] <freeaks> i've read on forums ppl are able to get it working, i tryed all i could without result
[14:50] <kubuntuser> latest daily work fine..
[14:50] <kubuntuser> the wireless..
[14:50] <freeaks> kubuntuser, in software source,
[14:51] <freeaks> you have a tab ""additional driver
[14:51] <kubuntuser> oh ok
[14:51] <freeaks> where it offer a driver for the wireless chip
[14:52] <freeaks> otherwise, you can use steps explained here : http://cberner.com/2012/10/19/installing-ubuntu-12-10-on-macbook-pro-retina/
[14:52] <freeaks> the method using b43-fwcutter
[14:52] <kubuntuser> i don't have additional driver
[14:52] <freeaks> read step 4 of the first link i gave to you
[14:53] <freeaks> 2nd link sorry
[14:53] <freeaks> i use xubuntu
[14:53] <kubuntuser> ok
[14:54] <freeaks> maybe in unity the tab "additional driver isn't there i don't know, it used to be jockey-gtk
[14:54] <freeaks> the little gui for installing proprietary 3rd party hardware driver
[14:54] <freeaks> but if you follow the step 4 of the 2nd link you won't need it
[14:55] <kubuntuser> i reboot now thanks
[14:55] <kubuntuser> :)
[14:55] <freeaks> k
[14:55] <freeaks> good luck :)
[14:58] <freeaks> BluesKaj, you have no ideas on how i could enable vga switcheroo and the intel chip ?
[15:00] <BluesKaj> freeaks, afraid not , if you ask in ubuntu I'm sure the method for 12.10 is very similar
[15:01] <freeaks> k thanks

[23:40] <kross> hi
[23:41] <kross> how to display the entire boot process with text without going into the recovery menu?
[23:41] <kross> i tried noplymouth in grub but this doesnt work
[23:43] <penguin42> kross: I take off quiet and nosplash
[23:44] <kross> that doesnt work
[23:44] <kross> i tried that
[23:45] <kross> its still lila
[23:45] <kross> i see only a purple nothing
[23:47] <kross> i entered nosplash, not working
[23:47] <kross> i tried it with noplymouth, not working
[23:47] <user82> kross do you happen to mean "dmesg"?
[23:47] <user82> (type the command once booted)
[23:48] <kross> what kind should i grep from dmesg?
[23:50] <kross> i hope i can this crap get running otherwise i will install fedora, because it pisses me off
[23:50] <kross> any release a other standard, wtf
[23:54] <kross> any release a new desktop manager, a new network manager with hard coded ip adresses, and other weird stupidisms, even windows can change the dhcp range, otherwise you have to install dhcp3, very annoying for novice users eh= change the entire network range from 10.,42.43.1 to 10.42.0.1 from natty to oneric, and other weird shit that makes any angry
[23:55] <kross> just keep the settings forever, and don't change them in newer releases, that doesnt make sense
[23:55] <kross> it just pisses peoples off
[23:55] <kross> if this crap doesnt work today i move to fedora, because on my laptop its working like a charm
[23:56] <kross> amen
[23:56] <dniMretsaM> I think kross is a little cross
