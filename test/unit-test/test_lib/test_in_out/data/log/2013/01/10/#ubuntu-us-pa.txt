[05:12] <InHisName> anyone awake still ?
[05:12] <waltman> yo
[05:13] <waltman> getting ready to head to bed though...
[05:20] <InHisName> If you want to use this feature, make sure that your kernel is compiled with the "IP: advanced router" and "IP: policy routing" features.   <--- so How to check if this is so in my kernel ?
[05:21] <MutantTurkey> I am
[05:21] <MutantTurkey> InHisName: unless you custom compiled your kernel... it probably is
[05:21] <MutantTurkey> these day everything is in there
[05:22] <InHisName> Not sure with this one, its  2.6.something or other.   Not modern.
[05:24] <MutantTurkey> 2.6. is modern enough
[05:24] <MutantTurkey> trust me :-)
[05:24] <MutantTurkey> 3 is relatively new
[05:24] <MutantTurkey> I would hazard a guess that most severs still run 2.6
[05:27] <InHisName> Well is there a way to check and prove its there or not ?
[05:30] <MutantTurkey> it's kinda vague though
[05:30] <MutantTurkey> config_ip_advanced_router
[05:30] <MutantTurkey> thats the setting
[05:31] <MutantTurkey> InHisName: do this
[05:31] <MutantTurkey> cat /boot/config* | grep CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER
[05:31] <InHisName> ok, now I c
[05:32] <InHisName> cat: /boot/config*: No such file or directory
[05:33] <InHisName> there is only a bzImage and a grub dir in /boot
[05:35] <MutantTurkey> what.
[05:35] <MutantTurkey> oh dang
