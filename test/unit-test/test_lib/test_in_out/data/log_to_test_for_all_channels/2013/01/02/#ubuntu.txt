[00:11] <Lady_Aleena> topper4125, it's what I have. ubottu, so the open source drivers should work with my video/audio card?
[00:11] <Ben64> arooni-mobile: you know you could keep 12.04 for about 4 more years?
[00:12] <arooni-mobile> Ben64, it looks like i cant upgrade it anyway
[00:12] <arooni-mobile> so i might have to keep it
[00:12] <Ben64> you could upgrade if you want
[00:13] <arooni-mobile> see earlier message
[00:13] <arooni-mobile> i failed jaja

[00:16] <machicola> anyone know a good freenode channel to discuss pc hardware? i.e. processors, memory, design & architecture etc.
[00:16] <topper4125> Lady_Aleena: IRC software is no longer installed by default
[00:17] <Lady_Aleena> How about a browser?
[00:17] <topper4125> firefox as default
[00:17] <angel56> topper4125: don't they install pidgin by default still? It does IRC
[00:18] <Lady_Aleena> Recommended IRC program to download when I install Ubuntu?
[00:18] <topper4125> Pidgin was replaced with empathy (or something like that... I just reinstall pidgin)
[00:18] <topper4125> xchat is a good irc program

[00:22] <Lady_Aleena> How plug-and-play is Ubuntu?
[00:23] <daftykins> Lady_Aleena: what would you plan to plug in?
[00:23] <dr_willis> totally plug and play for my hardware
[00:24] <dr_willis> but i researched what to buy ;)
[00:24] <daftykins> Lady_Aleena: the main thing is to check compatibility before buying. and don't trust salesmen in shops either
[00:24] <illovae> that's true
[00:24] <topper4125> Lady_Aleena: never had a problem with mice, keyboards, HP Printers, Acer monitors, Joysticks, my 3 GPS units (from Rand Mcnally, Garmin, and Cobra)...
[00:24] <daftykins> "oh look it says Linux 2.6 on the box, that'll guarantee it!"
[00:25] <Lady_Aleena> I don't remember the manufacturer of my hard and floppy drives or the specifics about them. My monitor is a Dell. I have a lot of USB ports.
[00:25] <daftykins> you can pretty much guarantee internal component compatibility
[00:26] <topper4125> hard drives *should* be 100% compatible, Floppies.. not so sure... monitor... yes... the only USB problem I ever had was with a M$ USB hub.
[00:26] <illovae> Lady_Aleena: sounds good, what is you graphic card?
[00:26] <illovae> topper4125: floppies? no problem
[00:26] <illovae> s/you/your/
[00:26] <dr_willis> some of those 'green' hard driveds were quirky . but i think thats been fixed now
[00:26] <Lady_Aleena> illovae, video and audio are all on the ATI All-in-Wonder 9000 Low Profile, I think.
[00:27] <dr_willis> all in wonder? how old is that?
[00:27] <MoL0ToV> what pc is? what cpu and chipset?
[00:27] <MoL0ToV> a pentium4?
[00:27] <Lady_Aleena> dr_willis, it is a really old computer (2003).
[00:27] <daftykins> i would highly doubt all the functionality of an all-in-wonder card will work under Linux
[00:27] <dr_willis> all in wonders were a Major pain even in windows years ago
[00:28] <daftykins> e.g. TV input, video capture, etc.
[00:28] <MoL0ToV> yes.. but today is all digital.. so a all in wonder is not needed...
=== James is now known as Guest62341
[00:28] <illovae> I recall that TV tuner functions work on ubuntu...
[00:29] <dr_willis> if you can find a analog signal to tune. ;)
[00:29] <Lady_Aleena> I may have a Creative card in the computer too, but I haven't found it on my devices list yet.
[00:29]  * daftykins cracks out the VHS player
[00:29] <MoL0ToV> here in italy in 2003 we use analog tv tuner, but from some years DVB is used also for tv.. so...

[00:29] <Lady_Aleena> I'm not worried about the TV tuing.
[00:29] <illovae> dr_willis: huh true
[00:29] <Lady_Aleena> ACK! tuning
[00:30] <MoL0ToV> Lady_Aleena, you have some ram memory? at least 1 gig is needed today to work..
[00:30] <Lady_Aleena> I have 1 GB of memory, maybe more which Windows isn't seeing.
[00:31] <topper4125> hmmm... wonder if the mythbuntu people have had better luck/worked harder with All in Wonder if it has tv tuner on it
[00:31] <dr_willis> topper4125:  last i used an AIW,,.. they wer almost useless ;)
[00:32] <dr_willis> i dont even recall the svideo out working
[00:32] <dr_willis> best answer.. put ubuntu on it and see what explodes. ;)
[00:33] <dr_willis> or lubuntu may work better
[00:38] <ugb> server
[00:40] <topper4125> looks like the mythbuntu people try to avoid it, and if *they* avoid a tv tuner... there's a darn good reason for it.

[00:58] <user82> William9455, is the package "linux-headers-generic" installed?
[00:58] <Kardos> no, but leaving a mess around isn't generally a good idea

[01:00] <Kardos> hmm ok
[01:00] <Kardos> then i shall rm it
[01:00] <Kardos> also
[01:00] <Jisawesome2> Worst case, you will have to add it back
[01:00] <Kardos> the dir /ubiquity-apt-clone has a few things in it, can i clear that too?

[01:34] <kslater> I'm doing an EOL upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 and I've run into a problem where it's trying to fetch packages from a repository that doesn't exist any longer. I have the old-releases.ubuntu.com entries in sources.list, but they're at the bottom. Maybe I should move them up?

[01:36] <Ironicus> Sorry, Partition 1 please
[01:36] <sporkubus> kslater: what do you mean
=== ubuntu__ is now known as Guest43722
[01:36] <kslater> badly worded question, are you using some gui tool? Or doing stuff from the command line?
[01:36] <sporkubus> command line
[01:36] <sporkubus> even though I don't really know what I'm doing, just following guides online
[01:37] <dr_willis> Ironicus:  so you have an encrypred 245gb partition that you want to 'rescue' - you do know how to unencrypt it?
[01:37] <kslater> dr_willis: Here's the error

[01:38] <dr_willis> kslater:  thats still uisng the old now eol repo. not the old-releases.  repo it seems
[01:39] <Ironicus> I do not, unfortunately it seems that the tech support dept at zmodo doesn't know much about how their devices are built, the type of encryption used , etc.
[01:39] <kslater> dr_willis: I think you're correct. I'm going to poke around on old-releases and see if I can spot extras
[01:39] <kslater> extras.old-releases.ubuntu.com?
[01:39] <Zapthus> Yo amo ubuntu!!!
[01:39] <Zapthus> oh yeah!
[01:39] <dr_willis> Ironicus:  so by 'recover' you mean 'unencrypt  a working encrypted hard drive'
[01:40]  * rootpt off
[01:41] <Ironicus> Here's the issue, there should be hours and hours of footage listed in the gui of the dvr, but there is none, so my theory is that the partition has become corrupted or the file system is perhaps corrupted?
[01:41] <Ironicus> I apologize for the vaguness of my request
[01:42] <dr_willis> Ironicus:  can you even see files on it?
[01:42] <Ironicus> no, not on partition 1, partition 2 has some log files, but partition1 remains mysterious
[01:43] <dr_willis> if the company cant even tell you the type of encryption used.. i would say its a lost cause.
[01:43] <dr_willis> unless you can get better tech support from them
[01:44] <topper4125> was the partition encrypted through Ubuntu?
[01:44] <Jisawesome_> serverplatypus, would that mean the pci slot?
[01:44] <Ironicus> Is there any way to determine what the encryption is?  there must be a tool available that can at least tell me that, right?
[01:44] <topper4125> if it was try this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/31675/decrypt-home-from-separate-partition-after-re-install
[01:45] <Ironicus> The data is encrypted by the dvr as it is recorded I believe
[01:46] <topper4125> oh... okay... start with googling  "DVR [model] encrytpion"
[01:46] <topper4125> I thought this was just a general "Ubuntu /home encryption" thing

[01:50] <Ironicus> I can add that normally to view the footage on a pc you would plug a usb storage device into the dvr, perform an export from the dvr menu , then use a comverter to convert the files from their h.264 format to avi format
[01:50] <cfhowlett> tripelb: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7
[01:50] <MoL0ToV> Jisawesome_, you are distant from wifi router?
[01:50] <Jisawesome_> I am probably 15 feet
[01:51] <Jisawesome_> And my phone can use it from over 30
[01:51] <MoL0ToV> if you go near the router
[01:51] <MoL0ToV> works or disconnect?
[01:51] <Jisawesome_> I havent tried, but I would predict the same result
[01:52] <MoL0ToV> what wireless card you have?
[01:52] <Jisawesome_> Rosewill RNX 150pc
[01:53] <MoL0ToV> you can try to check if power output level of the router and whe wireless nic is set to max
[01:53] <MoL0ToV> then try to change wifi channel
[01:53] <Jisawesome_> I was unable to install the drivers if that could be the issue
[01:53] <MoL0ToV> is possible that exist other wifi transimission on came chan
[01:54] <MoL0ToV> same
[01:54] <Jisawesome_> no
[01:54] <dr_willis> tripelb:  theres the #ubuntu-arm channel also
[01:54] <tripelb> cfhowlett: tx
[01:54] <Jisawesome_> My other devices pick it up fine
[01:54] <cfhowlett> tripelb: no worries.
[01:55] <kslater> so what I need is an old-releases.ubuntu.com repository that has extras for either natty or maverick
[01:55] <MoL0ToV> is possible that rosewill device is defected
[01:56] <Jisawesome_> I suppose it is possible
[01:56] <Jisawesome_> I havent tested it in any other system
[01:56] <MoL0ToV> try to place in another pc
[01:56] <MoL0ToV> and you see
[01:56] <Jisawesome_> Can a wireless card work without drivers?
[01:57] <dr_willis> Jisawesome_:  they always have somr sort of drivers.. mine are included in ubuntu
[01:57] <dr_willis> plug them in and they work
[01:57] <k1l_> kslater: you should replace the releases to old-releases for all repos
[01:57] <Jisawesome_> I cant install mine, the disk will not work on ubuntu
[01:57] <Jisawesome_> and ubuntu does not have them in the repositories
[01:57] <dr_willis> Jisawesome_:  disk? use the repo drivers/extras
[01:58] <dr_willis> or find a ppa
[01:58] <Jisawesome_> What is a repo?
[01:58] <MoL0ToV> Jisawesome_, open a terminal and do lspci or lsusb to view what chipset the network card uses
[01:58] <dr_willis> its all about the chipset of the card. not the brandname
[01:59] <Jisawesome_> Well, I downloaded a linux compatible driver from the manuyfacturer website, but I do not know how to install it
[01:59] <kslater> k1l_: the only place releases appears in my sources.list is in lines with old-releases.
[01:59] <MoL0ToV> Jisawesome_, all wifi card is supported in linux
[01:59] <kslater> so that's not it
[01:59] <MoL0ToV> only few arent
[01:59] <CrusaderAD> Anyone know what's up with the timer on ubuntu.com?
[02:00] <Jisawesome_> But linux can not run .exe files
[02:00] <Jisawesome_> Which is what are on the driver cd
[02:00] <MoL0ToV> Jisawesome_, you must connect the  wireless card then do a lspci or lsusb to view the chipset
[02:00] <k1l_> CrusaderAD: wait and see :)
[02:00] <MoL0ToV> then you know also what driver is needed
[02:00] <MoL0ToV> and you can donload and install the kernel module
[02:00] <cfhowlett> CrusaderAD: no one knows.  patience.  all will be revealed.  i gues
[02:00] <CrusaderAD> k1l_: no spoilers, eh?
[02:00] <MoL0ToV> if not included in linux kernel
[02:00] <CrusaderAD> :)
[02:01] <Jisawesome_> I downloaded a driver
[02:01] <Jisawesome_> But I dont know how to install it
[02:01] <MoL0ToV> you must listen.
[02:01] <MoL0ToV> open a terminal
[02:01] <MoL0ToV> and do a lspci or lsusb
[02:01] <Jisawesome_> Ive done that already
[02:01] <Jisawesome_> I know the chipset, and I downloaded a driver for it
[02:01] <MoL0ToV> and what are the chipset?

[02:02] <Jisawesome_> Its downstairs at the moment
[02:02] <kslater> so I commented out the extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu main line in sources.list. Now we're Calculating the changes, so that's progress
[02:02] <cfhowlett> yaboo: boot from usb/cd, run gparted and resize
[02:03] <yaboo> cfhowlett, thanks
[02:03] <MoL0ToV> Jisawesome_, connect the interface, do a lsusb then say what chipset are
[02:04] <yaboo> cfhowlett, forgot its a virtual box ubuntu, guess cannot be done?
[02:08] <user__> Soo.. whats goin on guys?
[02:08] <cfhowlett> yaboo: resize?  sure.  I think.  so long as you're only resizing the partition, not the HDD, the method is the same, so far as I know.
[02:09] <moes> !notunity
[02:09] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic

[02:48] <operhiem1> There's a certain kind of silence contained in a restrained panic.
[02:49] <operhiem1> To that end, any pointers on what more I should check when my initramfs doesn't prompt for a cryptsetup passphrase?
[02:50] <kslater> who was the guy trying to put Ubuntu on a Transformer Prime?
[02:50] <operhiem1> I do have the UUID of /dev/md0 listed in /etc/crypttab and have since run update-initramfs and update-grub.
[02:50] <AshleyWaffle12> kslater: Transformer Prime?
[02:51] <AshleyWaffle12> kslater: What's that?
[02:51] <operhiem1> If I run cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md0 name from the initramfs shell I'm dropped to when the root device times out I'm able to open the volume.
[02:51] <kslater> It's an Android tablet from ASUS
[02:52] <operhiem1> I'd still be able to boot if I could run vgscan and vgchange from the initramfs shell, but they're not included.
[02:53] <kslater> anyway, someone had asked about it earlier. I don't have much scroll back as I closed pidgin while my update is running
[02:53] <kslater> if that guy asks again, send him over to #asus-transformer, he'll likely get better answers there.

[03:23] <Xabster> i just kinda want some pre-installed programs
[03:23] <Xabster> sort of like the ubuntu distro made for learning and children
[03:24] <dr_willis> p0rk: webmin has a bad rep. ;)  ebox is normallt reccomended
[03:24] <dr_willis> !ebox
[03:24] <ubottu> zentyal is a web-based GUI interface for administering a server. It is designed to work with Ubuntu/Debian style configuration management. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Zentyal (Project formally known as eBox - including in Lucid/10.04).
[03:24] <p0rk> for real? Webmin has never let me down.
[03:24] <somsip> p0rk: not sure about the webmin integration, but: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem#Backup_Methods
[03:24] <dr_willis> !webmin
[03:24] <ubottu> webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. It is not compatible with the way that Ubuntu packages handle configuration files, and is likely to cause unexpected issues with your system.
[03:24] <p0rk> somsip, i read over that article a few minutes ago. ill revisit it, thank you.
[03:25] <p0rk> I completely understand, and that's fine, but I did not ask for help with Webmin, nor is it causing any problems what-so-ever. I will look into the suggested replacement in the meantime.
[03:26] <p0rk> hmm
[03:26] <p0rk> zentyal does look pretty

[03:35] <somsip> frustrated: yes - I have no experience of gnome so can't help
[03:35] <dr_willis> not seen  that issue mentioned in here befor either
[03:36] <frustrated> dr_willis: its extremely irritating
[03:37] <dr_willis> id make a new user. see if it happens to them.
[03:37] <Cong> I got a issue too. The paste option in the menu won't change from greyed out.
[03:37] <pyro3o7> if I have a static ip setup in /etc/network/interfaces is there any reason to keep the packages dhcp3-client and dhcp3-common?

[03:39] <frustrated> or do i have to go to another network for that?
[03:39] <dr_willis> #gnome perhaps
[03:39] <dr_willis> but gnome fallback/clasic mode dosent get much love
[03:40] <dr_willis> i dont use it either
[03:40] <dr_willis> gnome-shell is nifty
[03:40] <frustrated> dr_willis: why not?
[03:40] <dr_willis> why should i?
[03:41] <dr_willis> its limited, problematic, and scheduled for removal in the future
[03:41] <rhydin> why is 32-bit recommended over 64-bit versions?
[03:41] <dr_willis> rhydin:  idiot proofing.
[03:41] <frustrated> dr_willis: usually when someone says something like  "X doesnt get much love" they mean X doesn't get much love by people in general. Sorry I misunderstood.
[03:41] <alcaprawn> Does anybody use get_iplayer on ubuntu and pref with mplayer too?
[03:41] <dr_willis> if you have 64bit hardware, then use  64bit ;) if you want
[03:42] <dr_willis> frustrated:  gnome fallback mode was ment as a tempary fix its scheduled to be removed from gnome in the near future.
[03:43] <Cong> There'll still be gnome-panel thought, right?
[03:43] <frustrated> dr_willis: so ill be stuck with the gnome that has the annoying menu pop up when you move your cursor over the top left corner of the screen?
[03:43] <dr_willis> gnome-shell dosent have a gnome panel
[03:44] <dr_willis> frustrated:  theres plugins to customize gnome shell
[03:44] <frustrated> why do they have to mess around with success? gnome classic worked well. this is a serious question. does anyone know?
[03:45] <dr_willis> gnome classic had major issuea and a very old code base

[04:02] <dr_willis> going to google.com and entering a search term depends on the distro?
[04:03] <apn> dr_willis: no
[04:04] <vivekimsit> dr_willis:  Ok! one more thing, the script I am talking about starts a service and I have already wrote a script for that in the init.d dir.
[04:04] <rhydin> can the ubuntu image be overburned to a cd-r, or should it be written to a dvd?
[04:04] <dr_willis> rhydin:  12.10 i think needs a dvd
[04:04] <rhydin> thanks.

[04:16] <Reals> I'm having problems with ps. When I run ps aux only my processes are listed….. only sudo ps aux shows all the processes. Any thoughts?
[04:17] <Reals> I've searched everywhere on the internet for an answer
[04:17] <rhydin> are there any versions that require less than 4.8gb of drive space to install to a drive? my flash drive is only 4gb.
[04:18] <rhydin> the setup won't allow me to continue.
[04:18] <Reals> burn a dvd?
[04:19] <rhydin> er. i'm booted from the live dvd and installing to a flash drive
[04:19] <acovrig> what would you suggest for installing a virtual box machine to a physical machine?
[04:21] <Reals> if your booted using a live cd can't you just download ubuntu to the drive directly?
[04:22] <rhydin> reals, that's what i'm trying to do?
[04:23] <Reals> not a usb drive but the hardrive
[04:23] <rhydin> i don't have a hdd in the unit, that's the issue.

[04:34] <kelvinella> hi
[04:34] <kelvinella> what is jockey-text?
[04:34] <kelvinella> it crashes when I try to install Additional Driver
[04:35] <Emanon> Jockey is the program that handles that "Additional Driver" section.
[04:35] <kelvinella> but the nvidia driver is installed anyway
[04:35] <kelvinella> so should i just ignore the crash msg?
[04:35] <Cong> jockey doesn't work for me either.
[04:36] <Emanon> I have no idea whether you should ignore it but that's what it is.
[04:36] <Cong> some internal problem; bug
[04:36] <kelvinella> i restart the computer, nothing breaks i guess i can just ignore it
[04:41] <Cong> How do I disable sticky edges?
[04:42] <Emanon> Install CompizConfig Settings Manager and it's an option in there.
[04:42] <jagginess> Cong, compiz stuff.. it must be in there ^ yup
[04:42] <^Phantom^> does this channel dispense help for nexus 7 installations?
[04:42] <cheque> Simple question, Trying to find out if a friend made a user on headless setup without my permission, is "syslog" an actual user with a home directory? I get "syslog" and "cheque (my nick) as my two users after doing the following command: cat /etc/passwd | grep /home | cut -d: -f1
[04:43] <Emanon> In the window management section of CCSM Cong.
[04:43] <jrib> cheque: yes syslog is an actual user
[04:44] <AshleyWaffle12> jrib: But it doesn't have a /home directory does it?
[04:44] <jrib> AshleyWaffle12: it does apparently
[04:44] <AshleyWaffle12> cheque: Maybe he "occupied" the syslog user and made a home directory for it
[04:44] <jrib> (though the directory does not exist)
[04:44] <AshleyWaffle12> See?
[04:44] <Cong> Emanon, can I use something that doesn't involve CCSM?
[04:44] <mibitzi> it has a directory assigned in /etc/passwd but it's not created
[04:44] <AshleyWaffle12> Plus, having syslog might be convienient for destroying any logs of his actions
[04:45] <cheque> AshleyWaffle12, hmm any way i can find out size of syslog directory via command? i'm root n headless
[04:45] <cheque> If it's lots of GB's he may be using it for storage
[04:45] <AshleyWaffle12> cheque: Well, you can check all the files in it
[04:45] <Cong> Emanon, something installed already.
[04:45] <jrib> cheque: the output from your grep command seems to be normal.
[04:45] <AshleyWaffle12> cheque: type ls -la /home
[04:45] <AshleyWaffle12> What directories come up aside from your own, if any
[04:46] <Emanon> Possibly Cong but I don't know of it.
[04:46] <cheque> AshleyWaffle12 none just lost+found and cheque
[04:46] <AshleyWaffle12> cheque: That's fine then
[04:46] <AshleyWaffle12> cheque: Sure he isn't using your user?
[04:46] <LiquidSmoke> can somebody help me out with an install problem I'm having with a uefi board
[04:46] <cheque> AshleyWaffle12 no but i'll change pass for safety.
[04:47] <AshleyWaffle12> cheque: Also, you can use a different home directory than /home
[04:47] <jrib> cheque: what password are you changing?
[04:47] <AshleyWaffle12> For example, he could have made some obscure sounding /usr directory

[04:47] <maslo> is there such a thing as a mime email parser that I could use in a php script to get important information? plain body, subject, from address, to address etc?
[04:47] <cheque> jrib cheque and root passes
[04:48] <Emanon> If you're that worried AshleyWaffle12 just reinstall saving only /home/<youruser> and an apt dump (whatever that command is) of your packages.
[04:48] <jrib> maslo: you might ask ##php for best practices
[04:48] <AshleyWaffle12> Emanon: It's not me, it's cheque
[04:48] <maslo> jrib: I was wondering if there was a package that does it that I can call within my php script, I have tried several php classes but they all fail with some mime types
[04:49] <woot_> all_: Can anyone help me with "no such file or directory" error?
[04:49] <Emanon> Sorry AshleyWaffle12.
[04:49] <AshleyWaffle12> Emanon: Besides, even that isn't secure... It's theoretically possible to slip in a rootkitted package, right?
[04:49] <cheque> Emanon not that worried but just wanted to know if any user except my own existed that was suspicious seeing he may have renamed it to "syslog" thinking I might say thats sys log no need for suspicion lol
[04:49] <Emanon> I suppose so. So just backup /home<youruesr> to something with exec turned off to check for strange filesizes.

[04:51] <kelvinella> how do u move icon launcher in the unity bar?
[04:51] <LiquidSmoke> I am running a asus m5a97 motherboard with uefi bios, i went for a reinstall of ubuntu after getting a new harddrive and cant get around the the uefi bootloader, when i originally set it up, i remember using a lower version with a diff bootloader and then upgrading to current version....this now isnt working for me either
[04:51] <AshleyWaffle12> Emanon: Thanks lol, why?
[04:51] <Emanon> Click and hold until it pops off then move kelvinella
[04:52] <Emanon> Cause you seem like the kind of person who hangs out in security forums coming up with solutions to security holes that have only been exploited in labs.
[04:52] <Emanon> So you seem likeme.

[05:17] <^Phantom^> the 12.10 ubuntu kernel also didn't support it

[05:21] <^Phantom^> tried windows 2000 but things broke horribly
[05:21] <^Phantom^> so i said screw it and went with xubuntu
[05:21] <^Phantom^> now i run lubuntu (it's lighter imo)
[05:21] <Emanon> I found the solution. The Unity dashboard stores its entries in /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications so you just delete the appropriate file from there to remove it from the dash.

[05:25] <Emanon> Now, is there a keyboard combo to move a window from one screen to another in a multimonitor setup?
[05:27] <Basil1x> I think Win7 did something to my sound card with the latest updates that prevents it working reliably in 12.10

[05:36] <l057c0d3r> hmm good point
[05:36] <dr_willis> alsactrl has cli options
[05:36] <dr_willis> if i spelt it right
[05:37] <dr_willis> aha - its 'amixer'
[05:37] <Ben64> whats happening in 12 hours, 23 minutes?
[05:37] <dr_willis> checked the man pages. ;)

[05:39] <threex5> and when i started googling it i discovered this is a problem a number of people are having with no solution
[05:40] <Ben64> solution ^
[05:40] <threex5> thanks Ben64. The problem is that I'm trying to set commands in my .lircrc file
[05:40] <Ben64> you wanted command line stuff
[05:41] <Ben64> that works on it
[05:41] <threex5> so it asks you for the program you want to control, the command that you want triggered and the button that triggers it

[05:41] <Ben64> I used to use that in a script to control my volume from my multimedia keys that weren't supported under 10.04
[05:42] <threex5> Ben64, the result is the same as a simple amixer set Master toggle
[05:43] <threex5> it will show [off] and [on] in the terminal but it doesn't actually unmute it
[05:43] <threex5> it mutes it though

[05:52] <ivotkl> I am trying to set a home server. Which would be the best hw parts for it? I'm trying it to be a low cost server and won't be on 24/7. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2100427
[05:52] <ivotkl> I also need help to configure it and to allow connections from other networks into it.
[05:53] <dr_willis> ivotkl:  depends on what its serving. most any pc can serve stuff
[05:53] <dr_willis> ivotkl:  i got a raspberryPi as my home server
[05:54] <ivotkl> dr_willis: Just for streaming / copying music, photos and movies.
[05:54] <dr_willis> most any pc can do that
[05:54] <ivotkl> And allow remote access by let's say... 3 people at the same time?
[05:54] <ivotkl> Like a terminal server.

[05:58] <ivotkl> Oh, cool.
[05:58] <Ben64> if you're just going to be using it as a server, it doesn't need much cpu at all
[05:58] <ivotkl> But I'm not Rockefeller and prices are a bit high where I'm at (Argentina).
[05:59] <Ben64> like dr_willis said, raspberry pi would work as a home server
[05:59] <Ben64> $35
[05:59] <dr_willis> you could some old old pc as a decent server
[05:59] <ivotkl> Never heard of it Raspberry pi.
=== amit is now known as Guest46474
[05:59] <wachpwn> raspberry pi?
[05:59] <ivotkl> If it is hardware might be restricted here.
[05:59] <dr_willis> my pi does ushare/dlna ssh, and runs xbmc for the wife
[05:59] <Ben64> very small linux computer
[05:59] <wachpwn> Isn't that a python framework?
[05:59] <Ben64> http://www.raspberrypi.org/
[06:00] <ivotkl> Oh, like DSL? (Stands for D*mn Small Linux)
[06:00] <dr_willis> pi can run different distros and os's
[06:00] <kelvinella> Please install the Extension Pack from the VirtualBox download site. After this you will be able to re-enable USB 2.0. It will be disabled in the meantime unless you cancel the current settings changes. ??
[06:00] <kelvinella> how to do that?
[06:00] <ivotkl> like virtualbox?
[06:00] <Ben64> I have debian on my pi
[06:00] <dr_willis> pi is a small cheap arm based pc.
[06:00] <Ben64> I use it as a media center
[06:01] <ivotkl> About HW, I wouldn't like it to be too old fashioned as I might use it as terminal server as well.
[06:01] <Emanon> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi
[06:01] <kelvinella> VirtualBox is not currently allowed to access USB devices. You can change this by adding your user to the 'vboxusers' group. Please see the user manual for a more detailed explanation. ??
[06:01] <kelvinella> how to add user to vboxusers group?
[06:02] <ivotkl> Emanon: Are you kidding? That's a whole computer?
[06:02] <dr_willis> ivotkl: why would we kid
[06:02] <dr_willis> i got 2 of them.
[06:02] <dr_willis> need 4  more
[06:02] <Ben64> I want more of em
[06:02] <Ben64> shipping prices kind of suck
[06:02] <ivotkl> dr_willis: dunno. =P Looks like a robotic module. Too tiny. It's like a space-saving dream coming true. =P
[06:02] <dr_willis> and long waits
[06:03] <Ben64> I built a lego case for mine
[06:03] <dr_willis> its not an intel based pc. ;)
[06:03] <dr_willis> i cant find m y legos.. so i used wood
[06:03] <Ben64> Also, if I get a second one, it'd be 512MB memory
[06:03] <Ben64> dr_willis: got any pics?
[06:04] <dr_willis> Ben64:  its a wooden gift box i wittled with a xacto knife ;)
[06:04] <ivotkl> I can get here in my country some 512MB Raspberries.
[06:04] <ivotkl> http://listado.mercadolibre.com.ar/mini-computador-raspberry-pi-%28model-b%29_PciaId_Capital-Federal
[06:04] <dr_willis> ivotkl:  so most any pc can work as a server.. depending on the details of what its serving
[06:04] <ivotkl> site is similar as bestbuy.
[06:05] <dr_willis> pi's are nifty in some uses
[06:05] <ivotkl> dr_willis: ok, and how about serving as a terminal? I think it requires more powerful HW for that.
[06:05] <Ben64> ivotkl: that is $244 USD?
[06:06] <ivotkl> Ben64: Should be.
[06:06] <ivotkl> Lemme see.
[06:06] <Ben64> that's way way too much
[06:06] <ivotkl> I know. =P
[06:06] <dr_willis> ivotkl:  i ssh into my pi from my cell phone
[06:07] <dr_willis> pi should be like $35 us
[06:07] <ivotkl> It is actually 153 USD if I take official average price of USD here.
[06:07] <dr_willis> someone is ripping someone off...
[06:08] <Ben64> yep
[06:08] <ivotkl> Well, I'm in Argentina. They take advantage of us and we have USD restrictions similar to the ones in Venezuela.
[06:08] <Ben64> RS delivers to Argentina
[06:08] <ivotkl> RS?
[06:08] <ivotkl> Ben64: ink please?
[06:08] <ivotkl> Ben64: *link please?
[06:08] <Ben64> http://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=raspberrypi
[06:08] <ivotkl> dr_willis: I would like to install ubuntu on my phone. Which are the minimum specs and how do I do it?
[06:09] <dr_willis> ivotkl:  as far as i know you use one of those vm things to put linux in a vm on your rooted phone
[06:09] <dr_willis> they are in the android market
[06:10] <dr_willis> or you find a custom rom for your phone
[06:10] <ivotkl> dr_willis: Could you create a basic howto or refer me to one?
[06:10] <b1tgl0w> Are there any programs to manipulate console output already sent to std::out? Use case: I forgot to send output to log, want to search output
[06:10] <dr_willis> ivotkl:  not really. see the android market apps/links
[06:11] <dr_willis> ive not seen a phone run ubuntu natively yet.
[06:11] <Artemis3> ivotkl what restrictions? and why would these people even know about the restrictions in venezuela?
[06:11] <ivotkl> dr_willis: Does it mean I have to sort of jailbreak it?
[06:11] <ivotkl> Artemis3: I was just saying. =P
[06:12] <ivotkl> To explain it better, I cannot buy USD anymore just because I want to. It has been restricted. =P
[06:12] <ivotkl> To travelling only.
[06:12] <Artemis3> ivotkl, and online purchases?
[06:12] <ivotkl> Artemis3: And you cannot even change whatever you want.
[06:12] <Ben64> don't need USD to buy a raspberry pi, they're UK based
[06:12] <ivotkl> And you cannot even change whatever you want.
[06:12] <ivotkl> It's the same for any currency.
[06:13] <Artemis3> ivotkl, you can't to any online purchases in foreign currency?
[06:13] <ivotkl> I can.
[06:13] <ivotkl> Artemis3: I can.
[06:13] <Artemis3> ivotkl, are you limited somehow?
[06:13] <ivotkl> Artemis3: Online purchases bought with CC are  subject to a 15% recharge, but it has not happened to me yet and I have bought some apps on Apple's AppStore
[06:14] <ivotkl> Artemis3: Economically, not that much. I can always save and make some overtime.
[06:14] <Artemis3> ivotkl, the limit is 400$ here...
[06:14] <ivotkl> And I could charge it to my CC and bank would convert it to ARS.
[06:14] <ivotkl> Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, you are from Venezuela. =B
[06:14] <ivotkl> Sorry.
[06:14] <Artemis3> :P
[06:14] <ivotkl> I cannot buy it unless I go on a trip.
[06:15] <ivotkl> And I believe I have to use them on the trip, unless I save them.
[06:15] <Artemis3> ivotkl, incidentally, new year means fresh 400$ quota
[06:15] <ivotkl> Oh, that's why a lot of Ven ppl go to US?
[06:15] <ivotkl> Not here.
[06:15] <ivotkl> It works differently here.
[06:15] <Artemis3> ivotkl, because there is a bigger quota for travelling
[06:15] <Artemis3> ivotkl, so you are much better :P
[06:16] <ivotkl> Artemis3: Oh, ok. Now back to Rasp...
[06:16] <ivotkl> (No offence BTW) =P
[06:16] <ivotkl> would it work as terminal server?
[06:16] <Artemis3> ivotkl, and the pi is like 25$, so not important, its when you need something above 400$ where the problem starts
[06:16] <dr_willis> theres the #raspberrypi channel
[06:16] <dr_willis> bbl
[06:16] <ivotkl> Oh, sorry. =P
[06:17] <ivotkl> not connecting. =P
[06:19] <ivotkl> raspberrypi channel, I can't join
[06:19] <wachpwn> so I just did a reboot on my ubuntu server
[06:19] <wachpwn> anything ssh/ssl is not working now
[06:19] <wachpwn> http:// works but https:// doesnt, ssh doesnt work
[06:20] <wachpwn> It's a remote box, am I screwed right now?
[06:21] <ivotkl> dr_willis: Could you point me to an android app which is Ubuntu OS? I could only find an app which emulates it and a Remote. Was that remote control you were talking when you said you used your phone to control you Rasp?
[06:21] <Ben64> look up your phone on xda-developers or something
[06:22] <Noskcaj> ivotkl, xda-devs or ask on #ubuntu-arm
[06:22] <OerHeks> rasp-pi is arm 6, ubuntu only runs on arm 7 AFAIK
[06:23] <Noskcaj> OerHeks, that is correct. you will need to do some stuff your own to get ubuntu-arm working
[06:23] <OerHeks> if you can't join  #raspberrypi the error is you need to be registered

[06:29] <somsip> ivotkl: it possibly means they cannot guarantee the final price in all countries due to exchange rates, postage charges, customs charges, etc
[06:29] <ivotkl> somsip: Might it go higher than 153 USD?
[06:30] <somsip> ivotkl: too many variables affect the price wheverever you are, and this discussion is off topic

[06:40] <kylescottmcgill> sudo apt-get install openssl openssh
[06:40] <katymoneyperry> well give meh sometime and we can see how this goes
[06:40] <kylescottmcgill> openssh will be either client or server sorry
[06:40] <kylescottmcgill> that should fix your https and your ssh
[06:40] <wachpwn> kylescottmcgill: It was working. I just did a reboot, now my box is saying no route to host.
[06:40] <katymoneyperry> i am making a 128 GB vd 60gb for swap 60 gb for hdd
[06:41] <kylescottmcgill> wachpwn: is your box sitting somewhere remotely?
[06:41] <wachpwn> kylescottmcgill: yes
[06:41] <kylescottmcgill> wachpwn: sounds like either the openssh daemon isnt starting, or the box isnt booting, do you have a control panel you can login to and reboot from there?
[06:41] <wachpwn> I think I just hosed myself with that reboot. I can access the http server on it
[06:42] <MyLittleBronco> Katy, you don't need that much swap space.
[06:42] <wachpwn> but not the https vhost
[06:42] <kylescottmcgill> wachpwn: some hosts dont work when you reboot the box internally

[06:43] <katymoneyperry> only have 4gb real ram
[06:43] <aridhol> Evening, I have a strange issue with mounting an NFS share via fstab. I am running 11.10, 3.0 kernel (just updated) and the NFS share mounts if I do it manually or via mount -a. It does not mount on bootup and no mount or nfs error is shown in dmesg (i did dmesg | grep nfs and dmesg | grep mount). my fstab line is host:/share /mountpoint nfs _netdev,auto,rw,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 Any suggestions welcome
[06:43] <Noskcaj> katymoneyperry, then buy more, its cheap
[06:43] <kylescottmcgill> wachpwn: if you can access http sites on your server that at least means you have access to the box, and its on, sounds like your ssh daemon isnt running, can you ssh -v username@domain.com
[06:43] <kylescottmcgill> wachpwn: the -v flag will give you a little more information on whats going on
[06:45] <wachpwn> kylescottmcgill: let me pm you
[06:45] <kylescottmcgill> kk

[07:01] <aeon-ltd> prishabh: that's the idea
[07:01] <prishabh> wow
[07:01] <prishabh> maybe 13.04
[07:02] <MyLittleBronco> They really need to slow down on the upgrades and work on the bugs.
[07:02] <MyLittleBronco> Maybe even start releasing that hard to find software and missing libraries.
[07:03] <aeon-ltd> MyLittleBronco: but new releases include bug fixes...

[07:06] <persony> Hi there, new install of ubuntu 12.10, on an ASUS N56VZ laptop. I have a USB mouse, which I have to unplug and replug back in a crap ton of times, in order for it to function / initialize. The mouse is new, and works fine on Windows. Any help is appreciated (quite annoying) every restart, the mouse stops working.
[07:06] <Emanon> Or "this release we're making noveau work properly so you can replace the proprietary drivers with it without sacrificing functionality."
[07:06] <MyLittleBronco> I'd still like to see more support libraries. I'm tired of getting dependency issues about missing libraries while trying to install programs.
[07:07] <MyLittleBronco> Persony, I think your Asus and USB mouse are blacklisted.

[07:11] <theos> ecthiender after logging in, the pointer just hangs at the position it was at before logging in. no buttons work
[07:11] <MyLittleBronco> Theos, if it worked before even after log in, you need to undo whatever you did. Usually messing with conf files or installing unsupported software will cause hardware to stop working.
[07:11] <theos> MyLittleBronco i just pressed the on/off button :/
[07:12] <katymoneyperry> MyLittleBronco: booting ubuntu

[07:17] <katymoneyperry> so is it fine
[07:17] <ecthiender> theos, I dont know.
[07:17] <MyLittleBronco> unless it's doing something you don't want it to.
[07:18] <theos> ecthiender after everything failed, i am using proto=exps to make the mouse work. if that helps
[07:18] <MyLittleBronco> katy, it should be fine.
[07:19] <ecthiender> theos, so you are saying after logging in you are able to work? (make the mouse work?)
[07:20] <theos> ecthiender yes only after giving the options in modprobe conf. not by default. and its limited to movement of pointer. no scrolling
[07:20] <ecthiender> theos, oh! so you are able to log in, only your mouse doesn't work?
[07:21] <theos> ecthiender heh yes. thats the problem. the touchpad isnt working
[07:21] <ecthiender> theos, sorry then. i thought your system froze. undo the changes in modprobe.conf
[07:21] <theos> ecthiender then the mouse stops working again. i tried
[07:21] <katymoneyperry> does it look like it's connected btw not my real ip http://gyazo.com/11f3aa5b895d0a200ca5f6b6fd2fcaad
[07:21] <ecthiender> theos, and try this: sudo modprobe -r psmouse
[07:21] <ecthiender> and then sudo modprobe psmouse
[07:22] <theos> ecthiender i tried that. doesnt work without those options
[07:22] <ecthiender> after logging in. type that in a terminal.
[07:22] <nearst> hii
[07:22] <MyLittleBronco> hi, nearst
[07:22] <ecthiender> you have synaptic touchpad?
[07:22] <mini-HOWTO> hey
[07:23] <theos> ecthiender yes PS/2 synaptic touchpad
[07:23] <ecthiender> theos, any existing bugs? did you check in launchpad?
[07:23] <ecthiender> mini-HOWTO, hey :)
[07:24] <theos> ecthiender donno. i will check. but pressing the on/off button on the touchpad shouldnt disable the touchpad :/

[08:29] <Bowbles> I would like to take an existing Ubuntu 12.04 install, which is on a single drive, and then create a raid 6 array from some other drives in the system, and migrate everything over, so that I can boot from the raid 6 array and completely remove the existing single drive. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
[08:30] <ikonia> Bowbles: the concept is pretty easy, there are a few little niggles
[08:31] <somsip> mah454: ah - i see it was just natty that failed.
[08:31] <MyLittleBronco> RAID Tools, but I don't know the package name. You can dd the image of your drive.
[08:31] <Bowbles> ikonia: yeah the concept seems super easy
[08:32] <Bowbles> but then I keep getting stuck on stuff
[08:32] <Bowbles> and I feel like I must be missing some basic procedure
[08:32] <ikonia> Bowbles: 1.) make raid array 2.) copy data across (taking care with permissions) 3.) fix some file issues 4.) re-apply grub
[08:32] <ikonia> Bowbles: that's the high level process,
[08:33] <ikonia> Bowbles: the details are 1.) consider putting /boot on a seperate non-raid partition to make life easy 2.) change your /etc/fstab and grub config files 3.) apply grub to the MBR of the of the physical disk - not the raid array
[08:33] <MyLittleBronco> Well, it's 3:30 a.m. here. Time for bed. Zzzzz
[08:34] <Bowbles> ikonia: do you think it may be worthwhile to try and move my actual ubuntu OS to a flash drive?
[08:34] <Bowbles> and then run the array just for storage?
[08:34] <MyLittleBronco> Have fun. Don't blow up anything. Night.
[08:34] <ikonia> Bowbles: what do you mean by flash drive, like a usb pen drive ?
[08:34] <Bowbles> ikonia: eyes
[08:34] <nearst> blow your drive.hehe
[08:34] <Bowbles> yes even
[08:34] <ikonia> Bowbles: personally - no, USB disks perform badly
[08:35] <ikonia> Bowbles: so it will depend on your needs/expectation
[08:36] <nearst> since ive 2 partition, how about mbr?
[08:37] <ikonia> nearst: sorry what ?
[08:38] <nearst> sda1 is xp, and sdb1 is ubuntu.
[08:39] <dr_willis> thats 2 hard drives.
[08:39] <ikonia> nearst: but what is your actual question ?
[08:41] <nearst> ikonia, i just have blinking screen at boot after grub.
[08:42] <ikonia> nearst: sorry, I've miseed context again, what's happened, you've done an install and grub now doesn't boot your install
[08:42] <Bowbles> ikonia: should I be raiding drives or partitions?
[08:42] <aridhol> drives
[08:42] <ikonia> Bowbles: up to you, personally, I like to make 1 partition that encompasses the drive, set it's partition type to raid
[08:42] <aridhol> Evening, I have a strange issue with mounting an NFS share via fstab. I am running 11.10, 3.0 kernel (just updated) and the NFS share mounts if I do it manually or via mount -a. It does not mount on bootup and no mount or nfs error is shown in dmesg (i did dmesg | grep nfs and dmesg | grep mount). my fstab line is host:/share /mountpoint nfs _netdev,auto,rw,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 Any suggestions welcome
[08:42] <dr_willis> raiding partitions wouldent make much sence
[08:43] <Bowbles> hmmm, then /boot may need to go to USB at least temporarily
[08:43] <ikonia> dr_willis: it can make a lot of sense, depending on your partition layout
[08:43] <nearst> ya. i done install for 2nd time.
[08:43] <ikonia> Bowbles: you can make a small 200mb partition at the start of the disk and mirror it on the other disks for resillience
[08:44] <Bowbles> how would I mirror it?
[08:44] <ikonia> raid 1
[08:44] <ikonia> (for example)
[08:44] <Bowbles> But doesn't that defy the whole point of not putting boot on a raid volume?
[08:45] <dr_willis> aridhol:  dirty work arouund. put mount -a in  /etc/rc.local after a delay
[08:45] <ikonia> Bowbles: raid 1 is different than raid 5,6
[08:45] <Bowbles> ikonia: ok I understan
[08:46] <aridhol> Raid is at the basic, a hardware redundancy play is it not? Why partititon?
[08:47] <aridhol> dr_willis, I will do that if it comes to it. I just don't understand why my machine won't load it at boot or at least tell me why it won't :(
[08:48] <dr_willis> aridhol:  my guess would be networking is not up when it tries and is failing
[08:48] <Bowbles> aridhol: because grub has trouble dealing with raid 5 and 6 from what i gather
[08:48] <dr_willis> aridhol:  i thought there was a mount option to make nfs wait untill it tried.. but that might have been a samba option
[08:48] <aridhol> but shouldn't dmesg or /log/messages etc.. tell me that?
[08:49] <Nag_> hi
[08:49] <aridhol> I have _netdev in my fstab which I gather is for NFS3 or ealier to "wait" but it does nothing
[08:49] <aridhol> Bowbles, ah, I had no idea :/
[08:50] <dr_willis> aridhol:  i would double check that option. it  might have some limitations.
[08:50] <aridhol> I guess it makes sense to ask if the mounting of shares is "proper" to be done outside of fstab and in a seperate runlevel / startup sequence
[08:50] <aridhol> am I living in the past?
[08:51] <dr_willis> is _netdev and auto redundant could auto be overrideing netdev?
[08:52] <Eagleman> I am a bit confused with the owner system with apache, should the files in the http folder owned by www-data or the user that maintains those files?
[08:52] <aridhol> netdev without the underscore is not a valid option as far as I understand
[08:53] <somsip> Eagleman: I tend to leave the user as secure as possible, and chgrp -R www-data *; chmod g+s -R *; Depends whether production or local dev server though
[08:57] <Eagleman> somsip so the file belongs to the group where the user is in, even then if a user creates a file the file owner will still be user:user
[08:57] <dr_willis> http://www.rodneybeede.com/How_to_fix_NFS__v4__not_mounting__etc_fstab_entries_on_boot.html
[08:58] <dr_willis> has mention of _netdev not working as intended
[08:58] <somsip> Eagleman: no - if you create a file it will be owned by eagleman:www-data
[08:58] <Bowbles> so ikonia I would partition for 200mb at the start of each drive, and then mark all of those partitions as bootable?
[08:58] <cute_bettong> i have a samsung series 7 with a hybrid ATI/intel card, and for some reason sudo reconfigure xserver-xorg no longer seems to work in ubuntu 12.04 32bit, is there a replacement for this?

[08:59] <aridhol> etc_fstab_entries_on_boot.html
[08:59] <Eagleman> hmm if i create a file now it belongs to 1001:1001  so no www-data involved
[08:59] <aridhol> whoops
[08:59] <aridhol> sorry
[08:59] <FloodBot1> aridhol: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:59] <somsip> Eagleman: I believe your username is too long to display so it's using your uid instead. Looks like the parent directory is not g+s (if that is what you want)
[09:00] <TheCrownedFox> I would like to take a screenshot of a computer (running ubuntu 12.04) that has its monitors inactive via ssh, so that I can see what X would be displaying from a distance. Is this possible to do?
[09:02] <dr_willis> TheCrownedFox:  ive seen  it done. but dont recall the exact command. saw it on a android server tool.. lets me see if i can find it.
[09:02] <TheCrownedFox> Thank you kindly
[09:02] <aridhol> Thanks dr_willis. I have a hard time accepting that a user hack is needed to have a system wait for an essential share from a network. Are we to rely on this for running ubuntu in a production environment? rediculous.
[09:02] <cute_bettong> so no one has any idea about my question?
[09:03] <cute_bettong> what has replaced reconfigure xserver-xorg, becasue the command dosen't seem to work
[09:04] <arabi> how to enable java for firefox in ubuntu 12.10
[09:06] <dr_willis> aridhol: i dont use nfs at all so im the wrong one to duscuss the deeper implinations  with. ;-)
[09:06] <Eagleman> which umask do you suggest somsip ?
[09:07] <makara> hi. I'm formatting new external 1TB disk. But with ext4 it already uses up 64GB before I've even added anything?!? Is there a better filesystem? (besides NTFS)
[09:07] <arabi> how to enable java for firefox in ubuntu 12.10?
[09:07] <nearst> hmm.. i hate grub2
[09:08] <aridhol> Thanks for the attempt, I do appreciate it. Just dissapointed that a "common" usage is such a pain
[09:08] <nearst> arabi, which java ? sun or open?
[09:09] <dr_willis> TheCrownedFox:    export DISPLAY=:0 ; import -window root foo.png
[09:09] <cute_bettong> can anyone tell me why dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg no longer works? and what can i use that would replace it
[09:09] <arabi> I have installed openjdk-7-jdk already
[09:09] <TheCrownedFox> thanks, let me give that a try real quick
[09:09] <nearst> dpkg-reconfigure -phigh?
[09:09] <arabi> nearst
[09:10] <dr_willis> cute_bettong: hasent worked yor ages as far as i know. x auto configures mainly. no xirg.cinf needed in most cases
[09:10] <aridhol> makara, 64 is perfectly normal. for example a "320GB" drive uses about 22GB
[09:10] <nearst> arabi, try install icedtea6-plugin
[09:10] <aridhol> drive sizes are not what you'd expect :)
[09:10] <dr_willis> cute_bettong:  a deeper issue will be how badly supported those dual gpu   setups are in linux
[09:10] <arabi> nearst, thanks
[09:11] <cute_bettong> dr_willis, well i can tell you that the hybrid video card works perfectly in ubuntu, i was just trying to do the old xorg customizations
[09:11] <makara> aridhol, oh ok
[09:12] <dr_willis> cute_bettong:   if you have an xorg.conf then try just rename/deleteing it
[09:12] <cute_bettong> dr_willis, i do that and my graphics stop working
[09:12] <dr_willis> i dont know what customizations you need
[09:12] <cute_bettong> dr_willis, im trying to turn on my ATI cards power management feature so it stops throttleing my core temps
[09:15] <Eagleman> What would be a good umask for a www folder?
[09:16] <Eagleman> user:www-data
[09:16] <nearst> Eagleman, depend on user. i would love to use 777 on my localhost
[09:17] <somsip> Eagleman: it depends if you need to write. If not, the standard is to give you a 644 file, which is fine.
[09:17] <Eagleman> chmod 777 everything
[09:17] <somsip> Eagleman: Starts a very bad habit...
[09:17] <nearst> hihi
[09:17] <Eagleman> nearst started it xD
[09:18] <kylescottmcgill> the same as your webserver daemon Eagleman
[09:18] <somsip> Eagleman: is this local or production>?
[09:18] <Eagleman> lets say its production
[09:18] <Eagleman> its a homeserver running 2 websites with FQDN's
[09:18] <somsip> Eagleman: are you writing to any files (cache, etc) with www-data user?
[09:19] <kylescottmcgill> if you use apache, and apache uses www-data then use www-data, if you are the only one of the system then you could start apache with your user and group and set those permissions, but in any case i wouldnt use the /var/www/ folder, and set up a virtual host
[09:19] <nearst> agree
[09:19] <Eagleman> i think i am not writing to anything outside the www folder
[09:19] <Eagleman> some files do need write issues but thats only 3% of them
[09:19] <Eagleman> should be done by hand
[09:20] <TheCrownedFox> that worked pretty well, thank you
[09:20] <somsip> Eagleman: so you need write access to certain folders. Make them chgrp www-data and chmod g+s them. Leave eveyrthing else as it is. That should do it
[09:20] <somsip> Eagleman: but that is very simply put
[09:21] <somsip> Eagleman: big difference between getting it working and making it secure
[09:21] <Eagleman> 644 wouldnt the last 4 be useless since www-data is in first 4 ?
[09:21] <ErdMutter> Eagleman, what I do is have my /var/www set to chmod 775, and have it chown root:www-data ... then I make a symbolic link to it in my home dirrectory ... then i make the symbolic link owned by my user. Not sure if it really helps any, just found it to work the best... i might be wrong.
[09:21] <somsip> Eagleman: if you are not writing to the file, www-data only needs RO
[09:21] <nearst> security and speed is big topic in IT
[09:21] <malefiku> Hello guys
[09:22] <nabblet> hi, i am looking for a rdp comaptible desktop viewer that can connect to multible computers simultanously. i tried remmina but i can only open one connection :(
[09:22] <malefiku> I have another problem now with my website
[09:22] <nearst> hi malefiku
[09:22] <nearst> nabblet, why view multiple computer at the same time? :D
[09:24] <malefiku> I have on my tablet 2 internet connections: 3G from Orange mobile phone provider and WIFI, from a local internet provider: when I try to enter my mobile version of www.marian32.com it points me to Google, but on wifi works; on wifi doesn't work the desktop version of the website
[09:24] <nabblet> nearst: because i have to monitor them for some time and have to compare things on them
[09:24] <malefiku> What is the problem?
[09:24] <nabblet> nearst: settings, installed software and all that... having them open at the same time will speed things up
[09:24] <Eagleman> -rw-r--r--  1 user userr  629 May 27  2012 test.php  is what i currently have, just trying to make it more "secure"
[09:25] <Eagleman> directory:  drwxr-xr-x  3 user user    4096 May 27  2012 temp
[09:26] <somsip> Eagleman: PHP will work, unless it needs to write to temp. Like log files and such
[09:26] <kylescottmcgill> is it suppose to have userr as the group?
[09:26] <Eagleman> somsip then the creator from the program will say which files/folder needs specific permissions
[09:26] <somsip> Eagleman: not sure what you mean there
[09:28] <nearst> nabblet, owh.what os involve?
[09:28] <nabblet> nearst: win xp and win 7
[09:28] <MonkeyDust> malefiku  better try ##networking or #ubuntu-server
[09:28] <nabblet> nearst: googling shows that remmina has trouble with multiple rdp connections. there are bugs filed
[09:29] <Eagleman> somsip, like this for example:  Within your genealogy folder, find the files adminlog.txt, config.php, genlog.txt, importconfig.php, logconfig.php, mapconfig.php, pedconfig.php, subroot.php, templateconfig.php and whatsnew.txt and give them all Read/Write permissions (666, or rw-rw-rw-) using your file manager or FTP program.
[09:30] <cute_bettong> is there a command to make ubuntu tell me how much vram i have? i know the card is listed at 1gb gddr4 but i don't know if ubuntu is using that ram is there a way to tell?
[09:30] <nearst> nabblet, ya. if your xp and win7 in your network. why not use synergy.remote mouse and keyboard
[09:30] <somsip> Eagleman: yes - if you are the 'creator of the program' you will need to chmod those files.
[09:32] <nabblet> nearst: do i have to install synergy on the win machines?
[09:32] <nearst> ya. client and server method
[09:34] <nabblet> nearst: i prefere to use board software of win xp. i know there are many ways to do this job (teamview, vnc, ...) but i thought it should work via rdp too...after all remmian is very charming as long as it is only one computer. i am trying to use multiple instaces of remmina now, maybe that helps
[09:35] <nearst> nabblet, ya.
[09:36] <nearst> why everytime i boot into default grub my screen gonna blinking and hang?
[09:37] <nabblet> nearst: i am playing around with rdesktop too
[09:37] <cute_bettong> alright, my ATI card is reporting the wrong size in memory, is there a way to fix this?
[09:38] <cute_bettong> the ati card has 1gb gddr5
[09:38] <cute_bettong> the system is reporting 256
[09:40] <ikonia> cute_bettong: how are you checking this ?
[09:40] <cute_bettong> ikonia, im using an app from the repo's called hardinfo
[09:41] <cute_bettong> ikonia, its telling me that i only have 256mb of ram on my card, and the card physically has 1GB of gddr5
[09:41] <ikonia> cute_bettong: ok, I'd suggest some other checks
[09:41] <cute_bettong> ikonia, what do you have in mind?
[09:41] <ikonia> cute_bettong: look in the xorg log, see what that's reporting
[09:44] <nearst> nabblet, last time i use vino and tsclient. hehe
[09:44] <cute_bettong> ikonia, is there a command to tell?
[09:45] <ikonia> cute_bettong: look in the xorg log, see what that's reporting

[09:46] <cute_bettong> crap sorry
[09:46] <cute_bettong> diden't mean that >.<
[09:46] <ikonia> no problem
[09:47] <cute_bettong> ikonia, is that what you where looking for?
[09:47] <ikonia> no, I was expecting a line stating how much memory was available on the device
[09:47] <computer> how do i delete shortcut from Applications menu?
[09:47] <ikonia> !info hardinfo
[09:47] <ubottu> hardinfo (source: hardinfo): Displays system information. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.5.1-1.1ubuntu5 (quantal), package size 241 kB, installed size 700 kB
[09:48] <nearst> try lshw -C video
[09:49] <cute_bettong> ikonia, it's reporting only 256
[09:50] <ikonia> cute_bettong: what is
[09:50] <nabblet> nearst: vino is for hosting remote desktop, right?
[09:50] <nabblet> nearst: or is there a client function too?
[09:50] <cute_bettong> lshw -C video
[09:50] <nearst> nabblet, yup.
[09:50] <cute_bettong> ikonia, lshw -C video
[09:50] <nabblet> nearst: ok, thank you
[09:50] <ikonia> cute_bettong: what model card is this ?
[09:50] <ikonia> cute_bettong: and what model does lshw think it is
[09:50] <nabblet> nearst: i'll stick to rdesktop until remmina get's the multi-connect fixed
[09:50] <cute_bettong> ikonia, Whistler [AMD Radeon HD 6600M Series]

[09:51] <nearst> nabblet, cool :D
[09:51] <cute_bettong> ikonia, so the os is reporting 256mb of ram when there's 1024
[09:51] <ikonia> cute_bettong: is that aparture size set in the bios ?
[09:51] <ikonia> apature
[09:52] <cute_bettong> ikonia, this laptop has a simpleton bios, and the video ram is dedicated not shared
[09:52] <cute_bettong> ikonia, it's a samsung series 7 only 5 months old
[09:52] <ikonia> simpleton bios ?
[09:52] <jacklk> I'm on a friends server with also many other accounts, what's the best way to make my home folder private? What do I chmod it to?
[09:52] <cute_bettong> ikonia, bare features, boot order and the low level stuff nothing for a apiture size
[09:53] <ikonia> cute_bettong: could you please post the output of "lspci" in a pastebin please.
[09:53] <ikonia> cute_bettong: http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/samsung-series-7-gamer-1102324/review
[09:54] <cute_bettong> ikonia, http://pastebin.com/EfvkNDEU
[09:54] <ikonia> cute_bettong: I'm asking due to that as it says this machine is not customizable and it says it comes with an nvidia card,
[09:54] <ikonia> cute_bettong: be good to see the output of lspci
[09:54] <cute_bettong> ikonia, the samsung series 7 i have is model # 700z5a-s0a
[09:55] <ikonia> cute_bettong: perfect, thank you
[09:56] <ikonia> cute_bettong: interesting, http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/840140-REG/Samsung_NP700Z5A_S0AUS_Series_7_Chronos_NP700Z5A_S0AUS.html says it comes with a 6750 card
[09:56] <ikonia> cute_bettong: yours is a 6600
[09:56] <blami> ikonia: it has both intel and nvidia 6750
[09:56] <ikonia> blami: and yet his has AMD
[09:56] <blami> ikonia: wow
[09:56] <nearst> yup. dual gpu now
[09:57] <nearst> im still stick with intel GM915. lol
=== ericab is now known as ericab_away
[09:57] <blami> nearst: be happy
[09:57] <ikonia> cute_bettong: something odd here, it's also showing your laptop processor as a "xeon"
[09:57] <blami> nearst: those optimus thingies are evil
[09:57] <ikonia> when that spec says it should be an I7 2675
[09:57] <cute_bettong> ikonia, i assure you it's not.
[09:58] <blami> ikonia: that's correct
[09:58] <nearst> blami, aha. hihi
[09:58] <ikonia> cute_bettong: just seems odd that it's reporting a xeon and a 6600 card, when it should be an I7 and a 6750
[09:58] <blami> ikonia: my i5 thinkpad reports xeon PCI-E hub as well
[09:58] <cute_bettong> ikonia, is my ubuntu broken? v.v or is it fixable
[09:58] <ikonia> cute_bettong: I don't think it's ubuntu, just hold on
[09:58] <blami> ikonia: theres nothing like Core i7 in hwdb
[09:59] <ikonia> blami: perfect, thank you
[09:59] <cute_bettong> ikonia, according to the box the video card in my laptop is a amd hd6750M gddr5 1GB hybrid
[09:59] <nearst> uname -a then
[09:59] <ikonia> cute_bettong: ok so it may just be a pci identifier problem
[10:00] <blami> ikonia: it's not problem afaik
[10:00] <ikonia> blami: what's not ?
[10:00] <blami> ikonia: architecture in fact is Xeon in case of newer Core i-something CPUs
[10:01] <cute_bettong> ikonia, blami it's an i7 i assure you
[10:01] <ikonia> blami: not according to my I7 thinkpad, but it's just wording
[10:01] <blami> ikonia: newer Xeons and Core i cpus are almost same,
[10:01] <cute_bettong> ikonia, blami it's an intel i7-2675QM
[10:01] <ikonia> cute_bettong: try "sudo update-pciids"
[10:01] <blami> ikonia: better said newer Xeons are based on i7
[10:01] <ikonia> blami: you're missing the point of what I was raising
[10:01] <nearst> look at /proc/cpuinfo?
[10:02] <ikonia> blami: I'm not arguing better / worse hardware, just what his sysstem had identified, eg: xeon process bridge, amd 6600
[10:02] <ikonia> which are all differerent than what his spec is
[10:02] <cute_bettong> ikonia, that is correct, and there's been no change to lspci after running that command though it did update
[10:03] <blami> ikonia: only thing I am saying is what lspci reports is correct
[10:03] <cute_bettong> ikonia, the odd thing is that hardinfo is reporting the correct cpu
[10:03] <ikonia> cute_bettong: ok, so it's possible (although I'm not massivly up to date on the dual video card stuff) is that it's possible it's using the intel gpu but still listing it as the amd
[10:03] <ikonia> cute_bettong: does the intel cpu scale down ram to 256 ?
[10:04] <blami> cute_bettong: that's ok because hardinfo does more homework to identify it. lspci just looks on vendor and device ids.
[10:04] <ikonia> I'm assuming the onboard gpu is smaller than the amd
[10:04] <cute_bettong> ikonia, i think the intel card has 512mb of ram but according to catalyst it's running the amd card not the intel
[10:05] <ikonia> cute_bettong: I wouldn't trust that %100
[10:05] <cute_bettong> ikonia, blami here http://pastebin.com/nKYiWyST
[10:05] <nearst> ati=amd fan
[10:05] <ikonia> but I'm not up to date enough on the current intel/amd switching to be certain what it should display
[10:05] <cute_bettong> ikonia, blami this is what hardinfo reports
[10:05] <ikonia> nearst: ?
[10:05] <nearst> jks
[10:05] <cute_bettong> nearst, i love ATI XD
[10:06] <Jordan_U> cute_bettong: I don't know much about it, but I think some hybrid graphics implementations always have the integrated graphics card driving the display, and offload rendering to the secondary GPU. So depening on how these tools are looking at the situation, it might appear that the intel card is the card being used. (I wish I could also tell you how to get the value you want).
[10:06] <nearst> chipset is really different now. sometime i also confuse
[10:07] <blami> Jordan_U: I think AMD is stuck in phase they need hw mux
[10:07] <blami> Jordan_U: which is good for linux users because having laptop like Lenovo T420 which has everything except LVDS hardwired to second card is pain
[10:08] <nearst> << lenovo T43
[10:08] <blami> cute_bettong: could you please paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
[10:08] <blami> cute_bettong: it will give us a definite answer to what card is driving your display
[10:09] <lesshaste> huge numbers of copies of "wireless network authentication required"  windows appear .. how can I stop them?
[10:09] <cute_bettong> blami, http://pastebin.com/JqNAAry6
[10:10] <blami> cute_bettong: from that I can say youre running on AMD card
[10:11] <cute_bettong> blami, how come it's only reporting 256? is there a way to change that?
[10:11] <nearst> !info nomodeset
[10:11] <ubottu> Package nomodeset does not exist in quantal

[10:13] <blami> cute_bettong: does that amd use shared memory or it's own?
[10:13] <beachbrake> err, i downloaded 12.10 iso
[10:14] <beachbrake> and i need Untetbotin to take it to install linux on my new system.
[10:14] <cute_bettong> blami, the amd has dedicated GDDR5
[10:14] <beachbrake> but unetbootin is only supporting 12.04
[10:14] <beachbrake> anyone with a better solution.
[10:14] <nearst> beachbrake, it will work
[10:15] <MonkeyDust> beachbrake  I used unetbootin to install 12.10, what goes wrong when you try?
[10:15] <beachbrake> i am in an ubuntu system.
[10:15] <beachbrake> i installed unetbootin and there is no 12.10 in the dropdown menu
[10:15] <nearst> use iso option
[10:15] <cute_bettong> blami, im currently googleing this issue, but not finding anything pertinant so any help you render would be wonderful
[10:16] <MonkeyDust> beachbrake  download the iso form the website, then use unetbootin to put it on the usb stick
[10:16] <MonkeyDust> from*
[10:16] <beachbrake> MonkeyDust: i did
[10:17] <beachbrake> but i need to select somethign from the drop down right?
[10:17] <kylescottmcgill> what do you need unetbootin for? cant you just dd the iso onto a USB stick anyway?
[10:17] <cute_bettong> blami, can i go into xorg.conf and use Option VideoRam 1048576
[10:17] <nearst> what cause booting blinking
[10:17] <beachbrake> will it boot in the beginning if i just copy paste the iso?
[10:17] <cute_bettong> blami, can i go into xorg.conf and use Option VideoRam 1024
[10:18] <beachbrake> kylescottmcgill: ^
[10:18] <zhangyuqing> hello everyone
[10:18] <kylescottmcgill> not if you copy and paste it
[10:18] <kylescottmcgill> it needs the MBR associated inside the iso image to see it as a boot option
[10:18] <beachbrake> MBR
[10:18] <kylescottmcgill> What system are you on?
[10:19] <blami> cute_bettong: not sure if frglx supports that
[10:19] <beachbrake> ubuntu 9.04 currently
[10:19] <nearst> i love karmic
[10:19] <cute_bettong> blami, gonna reboot really quick we shall see.
[10:19] <kylescottmcgill> just a generic PC or Mac or ?
[10:19] <beachbrake> yes
[10:19] <beachbrake> kylescottmcgill: generic laptop
[10:19] <kylescottmcgill> beachbrake: if your on Ubuntu you could always dist-upgrade, however fresh install is always best
[10:20] <beachbrake> kylescottmcgill: i am trying to install it in another laptop.
[10:20] <beachbrake> erasing my broken open-suse.
[10:20] <kylescottmcgill> ok i see, sorry i came in half way :)
[10:20] <MonkeyDust> beachbrake  not from the drop down menu, choose 'disk image'
[10:20] <beachbrake> MonkeyDust: okay :)
[10:21] <kylescottmcgill> sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m
[10:22] <Jordan_U> beachbrake: From 9.04 you're likely to run into compatability problems as 9.04 had a much older version of syslinux. You may have to use dd, though be *very* careful if you do.
[10:22] <kylescottmcgill> Jordan_U: this is a fresh install on another laptop
[10:22] <cute_bettong> blami, im back
[10:22] <nearst> wcb cute_bettong
[10:23] <beachbrake> "space used to preserve files across reboots.."
[10:23] <beachbrake> ^ should i be specifying any page?
[10:23] <kylescottmcgill> Its just storage space for ubuntu
[10:23] <beachbrake> so 0 would be okay?
[10:23] <kylescottmcgill> i wouldnt worry about it if your not going to use it as a live USB type thing
[10:23] <kylescottmcgill> ya thats fine for an install
[10:23] <Jordan_U> kylescottmcgill: As I understand it, beachbrake is trying to make a bootable USB drive containing an Ubuntu 12.10 Live system, and is using Unetbootin from Ubuntu 9.04 to create it. If that's true, then my comment applies.
[10:24] <cute_bettong> nearst, thank you
[10:24] <beachbrake> no, i just want it to detect in startup and install fresh ubuntu over opensuse.
[10:24] <beachbrake> Jordan_U: yes
[10:24] <cute_bettong> blami, it dosen't
[10:24] <kylescottmcgill> Jordan_U: ah right i get you, ty
[10:24] <MordFustang> can anyone tell me how to send analog sound to TV?
[10:25] <beachbrake> Jordan_U: I also downloaded an iso in the 'downloads' folder.
[10:25] <blami> MordFustang: using headphones jack on your soundcard
[10:25] <Jordan_U> beachbrake: It's still worth trying Unetbootin, but if the resulting USB drive gives you an error from syslinux and fails to boot then you'll need to make the USB from a different OS or use dd.
[10:26] <MordFustang> blami: I have connected hdmi to TV and 3.5mm jack for audio but sound its not working
[10:26] <cute_bettong> blami, so any ideas?
[10:26] <beachbrake> Jordan_U: you mean, take the .iso and paste it on another OS (like windows) and recreate it?
[10:26] <dr_willis> MordFustang:  normally hdmi to a tv carries audio anyway.
[10:27] <MordFustang> dr_willis: I know
[10:27] <dr_willis> MordFustang:  the tv may have options to seelct what audio channel to use. or it maaay default to the analog when a specific hdmi port is used. or the vga port
[10:28] <MordFustang> tv thinks that he is receiving audio with hdmi
[10:28] <Jordan_U> beachbrake: Yes. (Though just for future reference, the term is usually "copy" as in "copying the file"  while "pasting the file" does make some logical sense, it's not said commonly and confused me for a moment)
[10:29] <dr_willis> MordFustang:  tryed the pavcontrol tool yet?
[10:29] <MordFustang> dr_willis no what is that :)?
[10:29] <dr_willis> its a tool.. install it.. try it
[10:29] <dr_willis> !info pavcontrol
[10:29] <ubottu> Package pavcontrol does not exist in quantal
[10:29] <cute_bettong> so no one has any answers to my problem?
[10:30] <dr_willis> if i can get its name right
[10:30] <dr_willis> !info pavucontrol
[10:30] <ubottu> pavucontrol (source: pavucontrol): PulseAudio Volume Control. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0-1 (quantal), package size 140 kB, installed size 953 kB
[10:30] <dr_willis> no idea why it has a U in the name
[10:30] <beachbrake> Jordan_U: okay.
[10:32] <MordFustang> dr_willis: pavucontrol is not the right solution
[10:33] <dr_willis> MordFustang:  i recall using it befor to enable hami audio on my system.
[10:33] <dr_willis> or was it pavmixer
[10:33] <Slaptman> Can anyoneplease recommend an alternative for itunes mainly intrested in podcast and music
[10:33] <dr_willis> !info pavmixer
[10:33] <ubottu> Package pavmixer does not exist in quantal
[10:34] <MordFustang> dr_willis: my graphic card is not connected to spdif
[10:34] <dr_willis> not on my ubuntu box so i cant check
[10:34] <blami> it's pavucontrol afaik
[10:34] <kylescottmcgill> Slaptman: Rhythembox is standard for that kinda stuff
[10:34] <dr_willis> MordFustang:  i dont see how spdif figures into it.
[10:34] <blami> cute_bettong: no, really. Those proprietary drivers are kinda black magic
[10:34] <blami> Slaptman: rhythmbox works well
[10:35] <cute_bettong> blami, i must have missed something what are you talking about? im using a driver that i compiled for ubuntu from ati
[10:37] <MordFustang> dr_willis: in windows I need to change some registry files to get audio working so I think I need to change some magic file here in ubuntu :)
[10:37] <dr_willis> MordFustang:  i just play somthing making noise. then use pavucontrol to tell it to use the hdmi out
[10:37] <dr_willis> or i tell it to use the analog out
[10:38] <dr_willis> or i recall telling it to send some apps to the analog.. and other to hdmi
[10:38] <dr_willis> i think i did that once. ;)

[10:49] <djono> hello ive just installed wine and kind find it in my menu in lubuntu
[10:49] <dr_willis> if yiu had ubuntu on a seperate hd like sdb. then you could put it on sdb and boot sdb leaving windows untouched
[10:49] <beachbrake> "no root file system is defined"  please correct this from partitioning system"
[10:49] <dr_willis> djono:  wine dosent really have an icon
[10:49] <dr_willis> beachbrake:  tell the installer what partition you want to use for /
[10:50] <pavs> you can use wine from commandline. or start and windows exe and wine will cmoe in to action.
[10:50] <dr_willis> djono:   'wine /path/to/windowsapp.exe'
[10:50] <djono> i used mint before this lubuntu install and it had a wine configure icon and a C: folder
[10:50] <beachbrake> dr_willis: I have said /dev/sda
[10:50] <dr_willis> c: will get made aftwe you run an app with wine
[10:50] <dtourond> djono: Just start the Windows program and it should start automatically.
[10:50] <beachbrake> its giving me that error.
[10:50] <dr_willis> beachbrake:  / would be a partition. not a hd.

[11:50] <varnie> it is mounted in /media/
[11:51] <dencrypt> looks like a USB to me
[11:51] <varnie> maybe it is left from the previous ubuntu installed.

[12:44] <oskar-> dr_willis, network and ssh is already running then, so i could log in and see a process with command "/etc/init.d/apparmor start". also, when i pressed a key, the next output was from the apparmor script. but what i see now is, that it is not so very well reproducible. i will investigate...

[13:30] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[13:30] <GeorgeJ> I have a question. My fstab contains a mountpoint on /dev/mapper/tobi-root. Can I not use /dev/tobi/root instead?
[13:31] <ikonia> GeorgeJ: you can call the device what you want
[13:31] <GeorgeJ> I see all of them are symlinks, so there should be no reason for them not to be created at the same time, correct?
[13:32] <ikonia> GeorgeJ: what ?
[13:32] <ikonia> GeorgeJ: they are created by udev at boot time
[13:32] <nearst> maybe raid or lvm
[13:33] <GeorgeJ> My only concern was that /dev/<myvg> might not exist at boot-time.
[13:34] <ikonia> GeorgeJ: it gets created by udev

[13:36] <asilhouette> you don't need a cd

[13:39] <grm> ／abook
[13:39] <nearst> why not?
[13:39] <ivotkl> nextblove: you can use gparted if you want to, I can't recall if file manager allows format (I think it does).

[13:41] <Ben64> Cong: in other words, a flash drive
[13:42] <azazel> no i checked its no available for ubuntu 10.10
[13:42] <Cong> No. It's not the same, Ben64
[13:42] <w3bg33k> my swap LV has 0% available on it...I want to resize it, but I can't when it's in use...what is the best way to do that?
[13:42] <Ben64> Cong: flash drives are all slow
[13:42] <cfhowlett> azazel: as 10.10 is EOL, perhaps it's time you upgraded anyway.
[13:42] <w3bg33k> i'm using turnkey linux, so i have bot the TKL web gui & shell access
[13:43] <michagogo> azazel: You can get a flash drive for probably <$%
[13:43] <michagogo> <$5*
[13:43] <nearst> kjslater, not sure your situation right now
[13:43] <azazel> if i stall ubuntu 110.04 will i be able to install ubuntu 11.10
[13:43] <azazel> 10.04
[13:43] <BWMerlin> I am trying to install the pidgin-plugin-pack through apt-get but I do not want to install all of the pack only two components contained within it
[13:43] <BWMerlin> is it possible to choose which parts get installed?
[13:44] <Pici> BWMerlin: No. It looks to be a package that just contains a bunch of plugins, not a metapacakage that would depend on other packages.
[13:44] <Ben64> azazel: it'd be easier to upgrade to 12.04 from 10.04
[13:45] <azazel> how do i do that
[13:45] <cfhowlett> azazel: current version is 12.10.  Current Long Term Support version is 12.04.  Unless you really need the latest/greatest shiny stuff, I advise you install LTS.
[13:45] <michagogo> Why is LTS recommended?
[13:45] <Ben64> lasts longer, more stable
[13:45] <BWMerlin> Pici: thanks
[13:46] <nearst> more longer, less cutting edge
[13:46] <BWMerlin> if I install from source would I be able to select the plugins I want to install or will it be the same thing, all or nothing?
[13:46] <Pici> BWMerlin: I don't know, sorry.
[13:46] <nearst> but point is stable running :)

[13:50] <ivotkl> nextblove: if files manager won't let you format USB drive, you should type this on terminal "sudo apt-get install gparted"
[13:50] <cfhowlett> azazel: update manager should offer to update you.  If not, check the settings.  There should be a selection box for LTS.  If you enable that, you can upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04

[14:04] <ikonia> rom: "what is the problem"
[14:05] <rom> still cant c my windows partition?
[14:05] <Ben64> you mounted it in /mnt
[14:05] <ikonia> rom: it's there in /mnt
[14:05] <ikonia> rom: you mounted it it has your autoexec.bat, your msdos.sys etc
[14:05] <ikonia> rom: it's in the pastebin !
[14:05] <cute_bettong> ikonia, so from what im seeing there gwibber is broken becasue facebook as usuall can't do its job?
[14:06] <ikonia> cute_bettong: ok, and there is a bug logged as you can see
[14:06] <cute_bettong> ikonia, yup seems to now effect every version of ubuntu, what a shame.
[14:06] <rom> oh, i didnt know that!
[14:06] <rom> thank you!!!!
[14:07] <ikonia> cute_bettong: that may suggest it's a problem with gwibber, rather than ubuntu
[14:07] <cfhowlett> ikonia: exactomundo
[14:08] <Touhou11> If Ubuntu ships with a piece of software by default, they should take an interest in ensuring it works
[14:08] <cute_bettong> ikonia, it's a shame that it's not fixed yet, gwibber when it works is rather nice
[14:08] <kjslater> Would an 11.04 install DVD have a rescue current, botched install option?
[14:09] <ikonia> cute_bettong: then work with the gwibber people to get it fixed

[14:10] <dragon> What's the timer at ubuntu.com for?
[14:10] <XphnX> I don't think anyone knows
[14:10] <dragon> And why is this room so awfully quiet?
[14:10] <DJones> dragon: You'll have to wait and see later
[14:10] <XphnX> But "so close you can almost touch it" is a big hint ;)
[14:10] <dragon> DJones: lol, seriously?
[14:10] <XphnX> Only canoical knows
[14:10] <dragon> I already feel all touchy-feely.

[14:11] <dragon> Hmm
[14:11] <KM0201> logic says its a tablet or phone
[14:11] <Ben64> kindle fire: ubuntu edition
[14:11] <KM0201> probably a tablet of some type
[14:11] <XphnX> Lol
[14:11] <Touhou11> Whatever happened to Ubuntu TV? Been awfully quiet since last year
[14:11] <dragon> Makes sense!
[14:12] <XphnX> Well they already have Ubuntu for N7
[14:12] <dragon> Touhou11: yeah, I've been looking forward to it!
[14:12] <XphnX> Which is awesome.
[14:12] <Ben64> WiiUbuntu
[14:12] <XphnX> It was supposed to be announced this year, UbuntuTV was
[14:12] <XphnX> Maybe late announcement?
[14:12] <XphnX> But I doubt it
[14:12] <KM0201> dunno, the tablet market seemss tough to crack.. apple and google have a serious hold on that

[14:17] <HowdyDoody> How to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 with liveCD and all drives in LVM (logical volume mgr) ??  Is there a clear cut way to upgrade that is not too complicated but not all that S-L-O-W ?   I've been told that using update mgr for the upgrade is VERY slow.
[14:17] <XphnX> I never had issues w/it, but
[14:17] <XphnX> I never upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04
[14:17] <XphnX> Hmmm
[14:17] <XphnX> I just installed 12.04 clean on
[14:18] <KM0201> i dont think lvm would matter
[14:18] <KM0201> so just upgrade as usual
[14:18] <KM0201> !upgrade
[14:18] <ubottu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade

[14:18] <katsunexubuntu> hey guys does anyone know how to install intel graphics drivers?
[14:18] <XphnX> Intel should come w/ubuntu
[14:19] <XphnX> Or at least the kernel
[14:19] <XphnX> Am I right on this? they intergrated it into the kernel?
[14:19] <katsunexubuntu> Xphnx that's also what I know, but I'm running xubuntu
[14:19] <Touhou11> katsunexubuntu: Intel graphics drivers are part of the default kernel
[14:20] <katsunexubuntu> XphnX and the screen is randomly tearing whenever I'm in heavy graphics
[14:20] <XphnX> What kernel is xubuntu using
[14:20] <keepbro> I have the 12.04 LTS version but I keep getting told to update on the update manager - every time I do it tells me that I need to connect to the net even though I am. The bug report says that it cant find what I am trying to update so obviously I need to look elsewhere but I am new to this OS and its all a bit greek to me
[14:21] <HowdyDoody> thanks, ubottu for the links, got a lot to read up on, now.

[14:27] <Laurenceb> can i restart X and keep my open windows?
[14:27] <ikonia> no
[14:27] <Laurenceb> wtf
[14:27] <Laurenceb> i just lost all my swap
[14:27] <ikonia> Laurenceb: no need for that
[14:27] <Laurenceb> oh, its cached
[14:28] <Laurenceb> maybe i ran out of memory?
[14:28] <Laurenceb> ok, how can i fix this?
[14:28] <XphnX> hm
[14:28] <XphnX> you were the one where the top bars had disappeared
[14:29] <Laurenceb> yes
[14:29] <XphnX> ok

[14:30] <Laurenceb> i have no browser
[14:30] <XphnX> o fail
[14:31] <XphnX> Try resetting the Xorg server:
[14:31] <XphnX> sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[14:31] <XphnX> try that?
[14:31] <katsunexubuntu> XphnX is there any other way?
[14:31] <katsunexubuntu> I really dont wanna leave linux
[14:32] <andrea_> Laurenceb: what did you do to restart X ?
[14:32] <Pici> yanick_: I was able to get my ATI card (with HDMI sound out) working with the help of this PPA on 12.10.  https://launchpad.net/~makson96/+archive/fglrx
[14:32] <Laurenceb> i havent tried anything yet
[14:33] <Laurenceb> how can i fix the swap[ issue?
[14:34] <Pici> yanick_: Keep in mind that PPAs are technically unsupported by the community, so you might have unforseen problems.  I haven't seen anything strange myself though.
[14:36] <katsunexubuntu> Pici who are you talking too?
[14:36] <Xotix> Just installed the virtaulbox guest additions, getting "The header for the current running kernel were not found", doesn't cause and fail/error but what does it mean?

[14:43] <linuxearth> what is the best uploading site where we can upload many big files and with security?
[14:43] <ikonia> nothing to do with ubuntu
[14:43] <WDKevin> I understand Zentyal is preferred over Webmin, but when I look at the Zentyal website it appears that it is it's own distro. Is that the case?
[14:43] <WDKevin> linuxearth, try http://ge.tt
[14:43] <yanick_> Pici, I did try this already, but it's incompatible with Gnome 3
[14:44] <linuxearth> WDKevin: i try
[14:44] <linuxearth> thanks
[14:44] <Pici> yanick_: Sorry, I'm using xfce here and it works fine.  XBMC too.
[14:44] <linuxearth> the site is good
[14:45] <yanick_> Pici, yeah :) I'm not sure why the open source driver can't enable HDMI... isn't it a standard output device??
[14:45] <wooo> Can I transfer data between two pc's(windows to ubuntu) using ethernet ? and without using ip messenger as installing ip messenger giving me error.
[14:45] <linuxearth> sure

[14:49] <benkaiser> is there an api reference for making panel applets for unity?
[14:51] <blami> benkaiser: indicators?
[14:51] <blami> benkaiser: or dock icons?
[14:51] <benkaiser> is that what they are called? the ones next to the wifi, bluetooth and sound icons.
[14:51] <blami> benkaiser: indicators
[14:52] <blami> benkaiser: I'm right now working on unified keyboard indicator and I can recommend you to study code of message indicator (one used by gwibber, empathy and tbird)
[14:52] <blami> benkaiser: it's pretty understandable
[14:53] <benkaiser> blami: thanks! :)
[14:53] <mega1> why when i do fdisk -l it tells me that root doesn't contain a valid partition table
[14:54] <benkaiser> blami: I tried writing a panel applet the other day (I have one that controls my music laptop over ssh) and It just lacked a good api
[14:54] <mega1> it also says that swap_1 is the same
[14:54] <katsunexubuntu> hey guys anyone know any alternative for  intel graphics drivers?
[14:54] <katsunexubuntu> the default driver for my xubuntu doesnt seem to work right
[14:54] <katsunexubuntu> it causes screan tearing
[14:54] <katsunexubuntu> *screen
[14:55] <blami> benkaiser: i think it's all pretty uncommited type of interfaces and apis ... it may change anytime
[14:55] <blami> benkaiser: gnome and related projects really doesn't care about documentation a lot ...
[14:55] <blami> benkaiser: (my point of view)
[14:56] <katsunexubuntu> anyone,.?
[14:56] <kostas> kanenas ellinas?
[14:56] <benkaiser> blami: fair enough, it doesn't bother me... but is there at at least an indicator that someone has written that uses a lot of the features? would be handy to look at that source...
[14:57] <blami> benkaiser: messages indicator uses pretty much from what's available
[14:57] <bobbleit> Regarding the ubuntu announcement today: http://socloseyoucanalmostbobbleit.com/
[14:58] <benkaiser> blami: excuse my ignorance, where can I find the source for that? (I have only been using ubuntu for 3-5 months and just getting into the development of it now), also is it in python? because python is my most fluent of the languages available for the api...
[14:58] <Seveas> bobbleit, your photoshop skills suck :-)
[14:59] <bobbleit> Seveas, i know! :P
[15:00] <blami> benkaiser: apt-get source indicator-messages will work ... and not sure but it's very likely there's python binding to libindicator
[15:00] <mega1> i have sda1 2 and 5 what happened to 3 and 4

[15:02] <benkaiser> blami: done, where do I find the source? roughly which directory...

[15:03] <blami> mega1: basically sda1-sda4 are primary partitions and sda5+ are extended ones
[15:04] <compdoc> blim, it should. I recently could not install 12.10 because it wouldnt work with the video card on the pc. but 12.04 works perfectly
[15:04] <blami> it's weird and I am happy it's going to be obsoleted soon
[15:04] <mega1> blami: sda1 is linux sda2 is extended and sda5 is linux lvm

[15:05] <genteor> any free  irc client for ipad2?
[15:06] <ikonia> genteor: nothing to do with ubuntu
[15:06] <blami> mega1: sda1 is primary - i think it's your /boot partition which holds your kernel and boot loader files
[15:06] <ikonia> blim: have you dont --listpkg to verify if your distro is supported
[15:07] <blami> mega1: sda2 is extended - kind of container that holds other partitions sda5+

[15:24] <wilmer> two computors on the network. Host computor have chared a folder in nautilus with guest-premissions. Client computor can find host when browsing network but when I double-click on the host I get "could not mount share- failed to get sharelist from server" why?
[15:24] <Guest97349> somebody talk spanish here?
[15:24] <Eagleman> !es
[15:24] <ubottu> En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #ubuntu-es; escriba "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y presione intro.
[15:25] <gac> Eagleman: there should be a way for you to mark your "self-signed" certificate as trusted, you'll need to do it on every browser you use though. you'd be better off getting something like a free Startcom certificate, as their CA is included in major browsers so there's a high chance of it "just working" whichever computer/browser you happen to be using
[15:26] <gac> also, UltimaKR, that sounds like nonsense. I would never use an "untrusted" HTTPS site, it could imply some quite nasty things (i.e. phishing) which your AV can't protect you from
[15:26] <benkaiser> blami: thank you :)
[15:27] <Eagleman> thanks gac  do they also support wildcard domains?
[15:28] <gac> Eagleman: not sure, I've never needed to try. but you can have more than one free certificate, so you could just get a specific one for each domain (unless you have too many to be managable, in which case you should probably cough up for real certs anyhow)
[15:29] <Wuschii> im having some troubles when i try to install python-qt4. It says that there are some dependencies which should not be installed
[15:30] <Eagleman> gac:  We are currently receiving more requests than we can handle. Please try it later again.
[15:30] <davzie> Errm, what is this countdown about, I thought that Ubuntu was April / October releases
[15:30] <gac> they're releasing some new product davzie, it's not related to ubuntu linux

[15:32] <Zephron> happy new year! tymnet
[15:32] <WhereIsMySpoon> gac: that's it
[15:32] <Eagleman> i will come back later, thanks
[15:33] <gac> Eagleman: i just signed into startcom fine
[15:33] <gac> once i'd found my client certificate

[15:38] <toxboi> bazhang: yep, I'm aware of that. Is there a solution for this apart from compiling from source or using third party repos.
[15:38] <bazhang> toxboi, find a PPA perhaps
[15:38] <toxboi> bazhang: I did but that's third party and not patched.
[15:39] <antithesis> Hello
[15:40] <tymnet> thanks bazhang trooper :)
[15:42] <tymnet> is there any way of telling if your install of ubuntu is correct. I don't really know what i'm doing and i've used sudo apt-get install sudo apt-get remove a few times?
[15:43] <toxboi> tymnet: If you're referring to the winehq package, the repo has the stable version.
[15:44] <tymnet> ah nah i'm not. i mean in a general sense
[15:44] <toxboi> You may need to check if it has compatibility issues.
[15:44] <tymnet> i've not installed wine yet
[15:44] <iceroot> tymnet: if "sudo dpkg -l | grep -v ^ii | grep -v ^rc" is not showing anything all the packages are installed fine
[15:44] <toxboi> tymnet: unless you've installed any third party repo, things should be almost stable.
[15:45] <tymnet> ah nice thanks iceroot
[15:45] <tymnet> that's the thing

I have looked at /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original and the correct DNS servers are in there.. any ideas where to look next? I can remote into the server by IP so I am guessing DNS is my issu

[15:50] <blim> if I redownload ubuntu will it be difference from the one I payed for?

[15:51] <jhutchins_wk> bieb: Can you resolve hostnames with the host command?
[15:51] <DJones> blim: What did you pay for?
[15:51] <blim> payed what I thought it was worth"*
[15:52] <bieb> jhutchins_wk: I have never used host command.. let me look up how to test
[15:52] <iew_paul> bieb: I've had resolv.conf be overwritten on me in 12.04
[15:52] <jhutchins_wk> bieb: host google.com
[15:52] <xangua> blim: you did not pay, you donated
[15:52] <jhutchins_wk> iew_paul: dhcp will do that, but I believe he said he had static.
[15:52] <jhutchins_wk> xangua: you can also pay depending on where you get it.
[15:53] <bieb> jhutchins_wk: "connection timed out; no server could be reached"
[15:53] <blim> and id happily  donate more but id rather be of some help myself
[15:53] <jhutchins_wk> blim: Did you get a disk from ubuntu or somewhere?
[15:53] <bieb> iew_paul: static IP
[15:53] <xangua> jhutchins_wk: blim you need to know the diference betweenm pay and donate
[15:54] <jhutchins_wk> bieb: That sounds more like a networking/gateway issue, although you say you can connect by ip.  Can you ping an external IP?
[15:54] <blim> you guys need to take a chill pill
[15:54] <DJones> blim: Who did you pay? You can make donations to Canonical, but you may have paid somebody to install the system, unless whoever you've paid have added apps, you'll probably get the same thing if you download it
[15:54] <blim> donate** yes
[15:54] <Touhou11> blim: Be aware that if you're donating, Canonical is a for-profit private company. You'd be better donating to Debian
[15:54] <toxboi> bieb: I've a feeling that maybe the DNS server provided by your hosting provider is not working anymore. Give google's public DNS a try and check if that helps.
[15:54] <DJones> blim: In that case, what you download should be the same regardless of what you donate
[15:55] <bieb> jhutchins_wk: I can connect to server via ip using putty.. can not ping outside ip..
[15:55] <blim> I donated from ubuntu side just before I downloaded the iso
[15:55] <jhutchins_wk> Whether he "paid" or "donated" is irrelevant to his question.
[15:55] <bieb> toxboi: 8.8.8.8?
[15:55] <Touhou11> I'd avoid Google's DNS for privacy reasons
[15:55] <toxboi> bieb: yep
[15:55] <ikonia> good lord
[15:55] <jhutchins_wk> bieb: Sounds like it doesn't know what it's gateway should be.  That should be in the interfaces file.
[15:55] <ikonia> privacy reasons....they are dns servers
[15:55] <blim> I dont wont help with the driver problem anymore just chill man
[15:55] <jhutchins_wk> bieb: You can use the route command to see what it is now.
[15:56] <blim> Ive worked out the problem like i was told to do XD
=== emile_ is now known as dawkirst
[15:56] <bieb> jhutchins_wk: route gives correct gateway
[15:56] <Touhou11> ikonia: Yes, and you have no idea the software which is providing the DNS service
[15:57] <jhutchins_wk> bieb: That's very strange.  Is there a firewall on the gateway?
[15:57] <ikonia> Touhou11: so....it's a dns server, it maps domain names to IP's
[15:57] <jhutchins_wk> bieb: Can you ping the gateway?
[15:57] <blim> and anyway I just wanted confirmation, that was all. Its not hard to give a person a push in the right direction
[15:57] <Touhou11> ikonia: I strongly suspect Google is recording every DNS request and correlating it with all the other data they hold on each person
[15:57] <bieb> I will check with the network guy.. I thought this address was cleared
[15:57] <Touhou11> ikonia: It's your choice anyway, just alerting people to the issues
[15:57] <bieb> jhutchins_wk: yeah I can ping gateway
[15:58] <toxboi> Touhou11: I agree. In this case, we just want to rule out the hosting provider's DNS server issue.
[15:58] <ikonia> Touhou11: your making up an issue...and warning people of something you have no proof of, please don't spread fud
[15:58] <jhutchins_wk> bieb: Yeah, definitely check with network guy.
[15:58] <Touhou11> ikonia: You're right, there's no proof in this instance, but looking at Google's long history of privacy violations there are reasons to be concerned
[15:58] <ikonia> Touhou11: please don't spread FUD
[15:58] <bieb> toxboi: should I put google dns in interfaces file? or resolve?
[15:59] <DJones> Touhou11: Googles privacy issues aren't really a problem for the ubuntu support channel
[15:59] <Touhou11> ikonia: I suggest you read up on the issue
[15:59] <ikonia> Touhou11: please don't spread FUD
[15:59] <toxboi> bieb: I did first try in resolv.conf and restart networking to check if that helps.

[16:58] <ActionParsnip> CookieM: but was the quantal install an upgrade from precise?
[16:58] <devsys> I just tried to reinstall grub via the ubuntu recovery option and it is doign the same thing
[16:58] <devsys> I was able to mount the filesystem and see the files, so everything appears to be there.
[16:58] <CookieM> ActionParsnip, clean install from dvd
[16:59] <devsys> Not sure what else to do...
[16:59] <Basil1x> 12.04lts here... my sound ikon has gone from the top bar.  how can I get it back?  also, sound keeps stopping, but one thing at a time.
[17:00] <CookieM> i erased the whole partition by parted magic before installation
[17:00] <ActionParsnip> Devsys: hold SHIFT at boot, do older kernels load k?
[17:01] <jtd> why does this say "#ubuntu-unregged" when I am in fact registered?
[17:01] <ActionParsnip> CookieM: weird. Not had an issue. Been on raring since October and still no issues :)
[17:02] <ActionParsnip> Jtd: I'd ask in #freenode
[17:02] <devsys> Action: I got this error with the older kernel listed ( 2.6.35-22-generic ) http://imgur.com/5WwPd
[17:02] <CookieM> ActionParsnip, i'm on precise from the premiere and nothing serious happened but wanted to give quantal a try and it failed
[17:03] <jtd> so, I have Ubuntu Quantal authing to AD for logins and it seems to be working well. I created /home/DOMAIN for domain accounts to have their home directories created, but instead of creating home directories it's just complaining they don't have one and putting them in /. How do I get it to create their homedir on login if it doesn't exist?
[17:03] <jhutchins_wk> devsys: Can you boot to the previous kernel?
[17:03] <ActionParsnip> CookieM: no bad thing. Lts is nice to have

[17:04] <Basil1x> Anyone any good at sound issues?

[17:09] <pero_p> hi all
[17:09] <ActionParsnip> Kingsmith: the next release is in April,  not in 50 mind...
[17:10] <himura> Hi all
[17:10] <ActionParsnip> Mins (still getting used to tablet kboard)
[17:10] <Pici> ActionParsnip: There is *something* being announced in 50 minutes.
[17:10] <beachbrake> in ubuntu
[17:10]  * beachbrake breathes fresh air.
[17:11] <ActionParsnip> Pici: nice and vague :)
[17:11] <pero_p> why linux movie players can't play broken video files and windows can?! windows players like kmplayer skip bad parts and plays video nicely.
[17:11] <pero_p> ?
[17:11] <krishna_> Hii...can we make ubuntu as a client of microsoft isa server//
[17:11] <MonkeyDust> Pici  probably ubuntu tv or android something
[17:12] <yfi> pero_p: did you try mplayer?
[17:12] <pero_p> yfi, i installed SMPlayer
[17:12] <pero_p> yfi, seems using mplayer to play video files, still stop at bad parts :|
[17:12] <tjr9898> I am trying to use virtualbox as a regular user.  I added the user to the lp, user, and vboxuser groups.  But still does not work.  What should I look into?
[17:13] <Ther0ot_> hi all
[17:13] <himura> Hi, someone know how disable changing wallpaper in ubuntu 12.04?
[17:13] <ActionParsnip> Tgr9898: sudo usermod -a -G vboxuser $USER
[17:14] <MonkeyDust> tjr9898  open a terminal and type this line       sudo modprobe vboxdrv;sudo modprobe vboxnetflt
[17:14] <Ther0ot_> is there any body have good knowledge in ubuntu cloud?
[17:15] <pero_p> why linux movie players can't play broken video files and windows can?! windows players like kmplayer skip bad parts and plays video nicely? i even used vlc and mplayer, no effect.
[17:15] <ActionParsnip> Ther0ot_: ask your real question and see :-)
[17:15] <yfi> pero_p: assuming the kmplayer you are refering to is http://kmplayer.kde.org/, then the result should be the same
[17:15] <MonkeyDust> pero_p  try vlc
[17:15] <arabi> hey guys i have an information for you : IF YOU DISABLE libnotify on 12.10 YOU CAN'T RUN GUAKE TERMINA.... thanks.... :)
[17:15] <ActionParsnip> Pero_p: vlc does it
[17:15] <chaospsychex> arabi: 0.o
[17:16] <pero_p> ActionParsnip, any configuration for vlc to do it? i even used vlc but it stops at bad parts
[17:16] <ActionParsnip> Arabi: have you reported a bug?
[17:16] <TheLordOfTime> arabi, no need for caps by the way
[17:16] <arabi> ActionParsnip, where I have to report
[17:16] <Ther0ot_> mmm ok actionP
[17:17] <pero_p> MonkeyDust, the problem still there even with vlc :|
[17:17] <devsys> ActionParsnip: it is saying I should use xfs_check and xfs_repair instead of fsck. Never used these tools. Ran xfs_check and it reported a bunch of errors. Should I go ahead and try a repair? Or should I use fsck like you initially suggested?
[17:17] <ActionParsnip> Pero_p: Just works here. What is the output of: lsb_release -sc
[17:17] <chaospsychex> arabi: first maybe you should see if guake utilises libnotify maybe ?
[17:17] <pero_p> MonkeyDust, think i need special codecs

[17:18] <arabi> chaospsychex, how can determine the dependency please
[17:18] <makerbreakr> where does ubuntu builder save the ISO?
[17:18] <ActionParsnip> Devsys: sounds like an unhealthy partition,  it may fix the boot issue
[17:18] <chaospsychex> arabi: what? how did you install guake? you need to check if libnotify is present ?
[17:19] <chaospsychex> arabi: you shouldn't have dependency issues if you installed using the pkg manager...
[17:19] <Ther0ot_> i want to make private cloud by open stack but i stuck in (setup user credentials)

[17:22] <ActionParsnip> Michagogo: unity is a shell for gnome, it doesn't replace it

[17:23] <MonkeyDust> himura  right click on the desktop, change deskto background
[17:23] <MonkeyDust> desktop*
[17:24] <ActionParsnip> Pero: could try a PPA for a newer version.  May help. Could also try renaming ~/.config/vlc  then rerun the application

[17:35] <res22> what is the download timer for on ubuntu.com?
[17:35] <kylescottmcgill> Basil1x: start the gnome-sound-applet
[17:35] <MonkeyDust> res22  probably ubuntu tv or soemthing android related
[17:36] <kylescottmcgill> That will give your icon back
[17:36] <socrates_johnson> hello, i just purchased an asus windows 8 laptop and am trying to wipe it to dual-boot windows 7 and ubuntu. i installed windows 7 but when i boot from the ubuntu live cd to install linux the entire harddrive appears as "unallocated"
[17:36] <socrates_johnson> i'm new to all the uefi/secure boot stuff so i'm sure i'm messing something up there
[17:36] <kylescottmcgill> socrates_johnson: parition it first inside Windows, then come back and use that parition
[17:36] <ActionParsnip> Res22: an announcement of some kind
[17:36] <res22> ah
[17:37] <res22> I can feel the excitement
[17:37] <kylescottmcgill> is it the new 13.04 or something?
[17:37] <kylescottmcgill> lol sweet im glad i was up at this time
[17:38] <Basil1x> ummm is something supposed to happen when I start this applet.  Terminal just sits there
[17:38] <kylescottmcgill> it should spawn a Sound icon in your bar
[17:39] <socrates_johnson> kylescottmcgill: that's what i've done in the past but none of the partitions appear in linux at all. the entire 750 gb is unallocated (even though there are two partitions from the windows installation)
[17:39] <Basil1x> OK... it didn't.
[17:39] <xibalba> I have a list of IPs in file 'A.txt', I want to see if these IPs are in 'B.txt'. If they're not in B.txt, I would like output so I know what to add from A to B, any thoughts?
[17:39] <kylescottmcgill> socrates_johnson: Windows 8 / 7 havnt changed parition types have they?
[17:39] <xibalba> plz type my name if you have some though so i can see it
[17:40] <kylescottmcgill> uefi should effect your Parition Map
[17:40] <makerbreakr> xibalba man diff
[17:40] <kylescottmcgill> shouldn**
[17:40] <xibalba> man diff....yea
[17:40] <kylescottmcgill> Basil1x: what Window Mnager are you using?
[17:40] <Basil1x> lightdm
[17:40] <xibalba> the lines aren't exactly arranged the same, one is a config file, one is just a file of ip addresses
[17:41] <pero_p> ActionParsnip, tnx, i tried disabling "Preload MKV files in the same directory" in Input/Codecs->Demuxers->Matroska, and now problem seems to be solved. ;)
[17:41] <pero_p> ActionParsnip, in VLC of course
[17:41] <socrates_johnson> kylescottmcgill: does it matter if i do the installations with secure boot disabled? the only setup options that seem relevant are "secure boot" (enabled by default) and "launch csm" (enabled by default)
[17:41] <xibalba> i ran diff A.txt B.txt, wasn't too helpful
[17:41] <kylescottmcgill> Basil1x: lightdm is the login screen, what are you using after this?
[17:42] <ActionParsnip> Xibalba: join the 2 files, then use sort and uniq to mske the final list.
[17:42] <Basil1x> kylescottmcgill: lightdm, Unity. also have KDE, kdm and gdm installed
[17:42] <xibalba> ActionParsnip, even if they're totally different in structure?
[17:42] <xibalba> one is a config file, one is a simple list of ip addresses
[17:42] <kylescottmcgill> socrates_johnson: i dont think so.. but you could try disabling them, sorry im not sure
[17:43] <ActionParsnip> Xibalba: then you'll need to grep for IP addresses in the file
[17:43] <xibalba> i tried that with grep -vn -f A.txt B.txt
[17:43] <ActionParsnip> Pero_p: cool
[17:43] <xibalba> didn't seem to work
[17:43] <socrates_johnson> kylescottmcgill: no worries, i've tried it both ways but it doesn't seem to make a difference. although you can also boot off of the dvd/cd using uefi mode (or not)
[17:45] <xibalba> i think i need to grep B.txt to Awk then do a comparison
[17:45] <ActionParsnip> Xibalba: i'd ask in #bash
[17:45] <xibalba> i can regex my grep search for an IP right ?
[17:45] <beethoven8201> you tried diff, xibalba ?
[17:45] <xibalba> yeah, didn't get what i wa slooking for
[17:45] <beethoven8201> you should sort before diff fyi
[17:46] <xibalba> structure of the two files is different
[17:46] <beethoven8201> you can grab ips first then diff that
[17:46] <xibalba> thats what i'm trying to do with grep/awk right now
[17:47] <beethoven8201> sed might work too
[17:47] <beethoven8201> search for things that match regex, replace them with a new line before and after, grep out just those lines, diff after sorting

[18:07] <crshbndct> so the announcement was aboslutely nothing then? what a let down
[18:07] <Lockal> "Perfectly distilled" -- yep, ubuntu phone
[18:07] <FabianS> crshbndct: Well, they announced some vaporware.
[18:07] <bluefoxxx> Lockal, so the phone is available in Africa?
[18:08] <Calinou> djono_: you have to forward ports to use DCC, also DCC is beyond pointless in 2012
[18:08] <Calinou> 2013*
[18:08] <sc30317> what is going on with the ubuntu homepage?
[18:08] <sc30317> the announcement is making it drag
[18:08] <djono_> so how would i do that?

[18:08] <crshbndct> FabianS: yeah, on a year old platform.
[18:09] <Lockal> For those who are loading: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpWHJDLsqTU
[18:11] <ciastek> Has anything been revealed at ubuntu.com ?
[18:11] <bluefoxxx> Calinou, djono_, there's a setting somewhere in like /etc/default/iptables or something that lets you default load the irc_conntrack module, which will automatically recognize DCC SEND requests and DCC ACCEPT and open the ports appropriate to the particular handshake per host.
[18:11] <Ro> how do I change the default programs for lubuntu? I can only change my email and web client
[18:11] <bluefoxxx> if your firewall/NAT is Linux anyway.
[18:11] <bluefoxxx> if it's a commodity router, good luck.  Consider buying a TrimSlice or something and building your own router.

[18:18] <fas> Anyone here know how to go about getting Win7 in virtualbox via either OEM key or recovery partition?
[18:19] <qhartman> fas: It's incredibly difficult to do, not to mention a violation of the license.
[18:19] <pueblo> Hey, can anybody help me out?
[18:19] <ciastek> fas: you can bend win7 installation using *.wim images from recovery partition, imagex utility and some win7 disk to boot
[18:19] <pueblo> I played a bit with locales setting and languages and changed to something wrong within gnome-control-center my user language: (gnome-control-center:7723): common-cc-panel-WARNING **: locale 'en
[18:19] <pueblo> en' isn't valid
[18:19] <MonkeyDust> pueblo  start with a question
[18:20] <pueblo> and it now just crash if I open it
[18:20] <xibalba> how would i change this to just search for all netblocks period? egrep '183\.([0-9]|(1[0-6]|2[0-3]))'
[18:20] <pueblo> where can I change that setting without using the GUI?
[18:20] <MonkeyDust> xibalba  better ask in #bash
[18:21] <Mercury> I wonder how one goes about getting a development phone for the Ubuntu phone stuff.
[18:22] <Mercury> xibalba: What are you trying to search for there?  IP addresses that live in 183.0.0.0/8, any IP addresses?  Something else?
[18:22] <xibalba> any netblock, i have a file of different netblocks. 209..../20, 216.../18, etc...
[18:22] <mcrawfor> so
[18:22] <mcrawfor> now the counter says 0 but nothing is happening
[18:22] <Mercury> xibalba: Drop a few lines and your script into a pastebin.
[18:23] <Lockal> "As you use your phone the image will evolve": so at the beginning ubuntu phone has only splash attack?
[18:23] <xibalba> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1489370/
[18:23] <xibalba> i want to match on all of those
[18:23] <Mercury> xibalba: But there are lines that are not netblocks?
[18:23] <Porkepix>  Hi. I come here to ask some informations about erratic behavior with a touchpad. My sister just received 1 week ago a dell laptop shipped with ubuntu pre-installed (vostro 3360). The problem is that the touchpad is only saw as generic PS/2 mouse and that it cause lot of problems. I eventually found a driver made via reverse engineering, but compilation fail and I can't install it. If someone can help about this, please ?
[18:24] <xibalba> there will be some yes
[18:24] <Mercury> xibalba: There's the right solution, and then there's the really easy one which will probably work just fine.

[18:24] <Trunks2k5_> What is the name of the new operating system for smartphones?
[18:24] <virtu> MyUnity still not available for 12.10?

[18:24] <Mercury> xibalba: egrep '^[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\/[0-9]*$'
[18:24] <Trunks2k5_> sure but I thought there is a version name around
[18:25] <genii-around> Trunks2k5_: There's also "tizen" but it's an ongoing WIP
[18:25] <Munchor> gotwig, hi

[18:30] <gotwig> I hope I can install it on a n900!
[18:30] <xibalba> Mercury, my config file looks like : http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1489385/ : and doesn't seem to be grabbing the netblocks

[18:30] <h00k> For discussions on Ubuntu Phone, head over to #ubuntu-discuss
[18:30] <gotwig> bekks, a n900 supports everything on earth, and space
[18:30] <dlynes_laptop> During startup, my raid devices seem to be going down and back up again.  The reason I'm saying 'seem' to be, is because i set some kernel flags for them in /sys/block/md[0-1]/..., which seem to be getting set, but then after I've finished booting up, those flags aren't set
[18:30] <Mercury> xibalba: That's because you gave me http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1489370/ as your example lines, and so the grep looks for lines which are _just_ that.
[18:30] <gotwig> but who wants android on his n900....
[18:31] <xibalba> ah, i misinformed you
[18:31] <gotwig> its sooo crappy
[18:31] <Mercury> xibalba: Remove the ^ and $ from the grep.
[18:31] <xibalba> oh ok those act as literals?
[18:31] <Mercury> Those act as anchors, ^ means the beginning of a line, $ means the end of a line.
[18:31] <xibalba> sweet, i should be able to make this work
[18:31] <gotwig> I am really looking forward to Ubuntu on phones
[18:31] <xibalba> i need to 'sync' my acl list, and remove old IPs
[18:31] <dlynes_laptop> Is there somewhere in the boot process that I need to put the flag setup after?  Or, is there something i'm missing?  It's currently in rc.local, and waits for md0 and md1 to exist before setting those flags
[18:31] <gotwig> I once was an awesome ubuntu dev...
[18:31] <xibalba> big list of them, going to be a pain if i can't filter
[18:31] <gotwig> than I stopped my development..
[18:32] <gotwig> I hope I  can develop scope and lenses for that

[18:43] <GeorgeJ> Is there any way I can see which package created a user?

[18:48] <mega1> how do i mount a usb drive i just pluged in
[18:48] <iceroot> Chelsea: its epic
[18:48] <kylescottmcgill> the phone looks nice
[18:48] <kylescottmcgill> it would be better if they annouced how to blitz my iOS and replace it with Ubuntu or something :D
[18:49] <Chelsea> But... there is no phone. There's just the software, possibility and ecosystem.
[18:49] <kylescottmcgill> Fair point
[18:49] <milamber> mega1: it should automount, did it not?
[18:49] <kylescottmcgill> similar to B2G (Boot 2 Gecko)
[18:49] <milamber> mega1: if not, you should be able to see it when you do: sudo fdisk -l

[18:53] <dkessel> if there will be no phone in 2013, i guess they might build a simple installer for example for the nexus 4 and maybe other popular devices
[18:53] <kylescottmcgill> ya, the iphone :D
[18:54] <gvo> mega1: dmesg | tail -20       then look for something like: [1801309.393727]  sdd: sdd1
[18:54] <gvo> where sdd could be sdb or sdc or ...
[18:54] <dkessel> i hope there will be one for the galaxy s2 :)
[18:55] <gvo> mega1: Also as milamber said you can try sudo fdisk -l
[18:56] <Chelsea> dkessel, That possibility would be nice for a lot of people. But Cannonical can't build a product or service on rooting other phones can they?
[18:56] <kylescottmcgill> mega1: what are you looking for? is your Drive not mounting? If your using Gnome, you could try Disks
[18:56] <OldSam> does anybody know if there is a generic way to find out the location of _all_ configuration files for a given package? so that I could copy all of them to another ubuntu installation, getting the same service (same config)
[18:56] <kylescottmcgill> gnome-disks in the command line will run it
[18:56] <dkessel> yeah, i too guess the rooting part will be the problem
[18:56] <OldSam> (and also all database files or other relevant stuff)
[18:57] <mega1> i am using ubuntu server and i have used putty to access the computer
[18:57] <kylescottmcgill> OldSam: + that, i normally just recreate the ones i know of, but knowing where everything is would be mint when im configuring it
[18:57] <gvo> mega1: so did you try anything I suggested?
[18:58] <charley__> i have a question concerning dist-upgrade from ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10
[18:58] <mega1> sudo fdisk -l does not show the drive
[18:58] <charley__> i have done this but when i open my computer the welcome screen still shows 12.04 lte why?
[18:58] <Bighong> hey
[18:58] <kylescottmcgill> mega1: oh right, yeah the dmesg (or sudo dmesg) should tell you when you connected the device, if nothing is in there, check the drive again, once you have figured out what sdX it is you can mount it to /media or something
[18:59] <lduros> hi, is there anyway I can start the printer settings gui from the command line?
[18:59] <lduros> what would be the command to run?
[18:59] <genii-around> charley__: dist-upgrade option in apt-get does not move you between different releases of Ubuntu. For that you require do-release-upgrade
=== david23400 is now known as David_BUsy
[18:59] <charley__> as a stand alone command?
[18:59] <genii-around> charley__: Yes
[18:59] <mega1> dmesg | tail -29 unable to enumerate usb device on port 1
[19:00] <charley__> ty very much i will try it now
[19:00] <kylescottmcgill> mega1: fdisk -l wont do anything you have to give it the path to use like /dev/sda etc
[19:00] <kylescottmcgill> instead use lsblk
[19:00] <mega1> lsblk
[19:00] <kylescottmcgill> check lsblk first
[19:00] <gvo> mega1:  sounds like the system can't read your usb part.

[19:02] <OldSam> at least 'dpkg -L package' shows me all relevant files... now  it would be really helpful if there would be a way to just show the config files... or is that information is not available in the package manager?
[19:02] <gvo> mega1 what is the device?
[19:03] <GeorgeJ> genii-around: How would one go around doing that?
[19:03] <mega1> i have an external hp usb drive
[19:03] <kylescottmcgill> Server wont auto mount it, you will have to manually mount it first, if it can read it
[19:03] <kylescottmcgill> what is the device formatted as, and does it work in other machines?
[19:04] <gvo> mega1: so it looks like Linux isn't finding anything it likes.  I don't know how you'd get it to work.
[19:04] <genii-around> GeorgeJ: eg: sudo do-release-upgrade
[19:05] <charley__> the do-release-update doesnt seem to work
[19:05] <charley__> what is the full process
[19:05] <kylescottmcgill> charley__: you just type that command
[19:05] <genii-around> charley__: Not update at the end. upgrade
[19:05] <GeorgeJ> genii-around: I was refering to what you said earlier: <genii-around> grepping the postinst files for "adduser" and the added username might narrow it down too
[19:05] <genii-around> GeorgeJ: Oh, sorry, got temporarily confused
[19:05] <gvo> charley__: First backup anything you consider important.
[19:05] <charley__> says no new release found
[19:05] <GeorgeJ> No problem, I replied rather late.
[19:06] <kylescottmcgill> then your on the latest :)

[19:06] <MoL0ToV> i'm whatching these pages: http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone  ma non ho capito molto bene... so in  the next future we  can install ubuntu on a android or a windowsphone?
[19:06] <PeterJCLaw> hi, can someone please tell me what thing it is that tells you which package to install for a given program?
[19:06] <PeterJCLaw> ie: $ rvm list
[19:06] <PeterJCLaw> The program 'rvm' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
[19:06] <PeterJCLaw> sudo apt-get install ruby-rvm
[19:06] <PeterJCLaw> (I'm guessing that this isn't bash)
[19:07] <charley__> this isnt supose to format my disk right?
[19:07] <gvo> charley__: No but it is possible to make it unbootable.
[19:07] <kylescottmcgill> PeterJCLaw: goto rvm.io everything is there
[19:07] <charley__> ohh
[19:07] <michagogo> Is the ruby-rvm actually what you want?
[19:07] <genii-around> GeorgeJ: The pacgaes have post installation scripts, these are what add users if needed. the post installation files are found in the directory /var/lib/dpkg/info/      So what you can do if a script added user "george" for instance is: grep adduser /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.postinst | grep george
[19:07] <PeterJCLaw> kylescottmcgill: well yes, but that's not the bit I'm interested in
[19:08] <michagogo> According to the site, you should install with `\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby'
[19:08] <kylescottmcgill> then what is the problem?
[19:08] <GeorgeJ> genii-around: Awesome, thank you.
[19:08] <charley__> thank you gvo
[19:08] <michagogo> Ohhhh
[19:08] <PeterJCLaw> I'd like to know what it is that is telling me that
[19:08] <gvo> charley__: If the system starts to update and you have a power failure, for instance, it is possible that the system will be left in a state that's unbootable.
[19:08] <PeterJCLaw> because I think it's cool
[19:08] <charley__> and genii-around
[19:08] <PeterJCLaw> but also because it's got a bug

[19:09] <alesan> hi, is there a way to rip bluray discs with ubuntu? I do not have a bluray driver in my home PC
[19:09] <BetaSoul> touchscreen: have you check restricted drivers?
[19:10] <kylescottmcgill> PeterJCLaw: right i see what you mean, it could be an older package, or something, command-not-found is built into Ubuntu as far as im aware, but generally its bash or whatever shell that would normally say command-not-found
[19:10] <bekks> alesan: Do you have a blueray reader/writer in your PC?
[19:10] <alesan> bekks, which one?
[19:10] <bekks> alesan: Thats what I am asking.
[19:10] <GeorgeJ> genii-around: The adduser lines seems to span multiple lines. Since the user I'm looking for is called bind, I grepped for "bind" to not avail.
[19:11] <alesan> bekks, the reason I want to rip is that I do not have a BD driver on the PC I want to watch the movie
[19:11] <touchscreen> BetaSoul " have you check restricted drivers?" do not understanded ?
[19:11] <bekks> alesan: a driver is some sort of software. You need BD capable _hardware_ to actually being able to read the BD.
[19:12] <GeorgeJ> genii-around: Hmm, I have issued apt-get autoremove. Is there any way I can purge the data of the packages that are no longer installed?
[19:12] <gvo> GeorgeJ: Are you looking to copy a DNS server from one system to another?
[19:12] <GeorgeJ> No.
[19:12] <PeterJCLaw> kylescottmcgill: thanks
[19:12] <dkessel> PeterJCLaw: i think the program is command-not-found
[19:12] <BetaSoul> http://cybernetnews.com/install-and-enable-restricted-drivers-in-ubuntu/
[19:13] <GeorgeJ> I've installed samba4, which I've now uninstalled, but its dependencies I removed with apt-get autoremove.
[19:13] <alesan> bekks, OK make that "Blueray disc drive"... a little pedantic this year uh ;) ???
[19:13] <GeorgeJ> I also want to purge the data the dependencies(which no longer exists) have.
[19:13] <michagogo> GeorgeJ: you mean `apt-get purge'?
[19:13] <kylescottmcgill> autoremove will only remove it if its no longer needed
[19:13] <bekks> alesan: So you dont have a BD disc drive then?
[19:13] <PeterJCLaw> dkessel: looks like it, thanks
[19:13] <GeorgeJ> I'm actually looking for something on the lines of apt-get autopurge.
[19:14] <michagogo> IIRC apt-get has a switch or option or something to purge anywhere that it'd remove or something
[19:14] <kylescottmcgill> GeorgeJ: there is purge and clean
[19:14] <alesan> bekks, not in the computer where I want to play the video.

[19:15] <bekks> alesan: So how is your question related to Ubuntu then, without even having Ubuntu and without BD cap0able hardware?
[19:15] <mrec> of course with ubuntu :-)

[20:37] <mrec> where is this freaking LC_LANG defined?
[20:37] <Sazpaimon> can anyone tell me why ubuntu server comes with wireless stuff?
[20:37] <scellef> mrec: grep -R LC_LANG /etc
[20:37] <mrec> nowhere there
[20:37] <Sazpaimon> like, iw, wireless-tools, wireless-regdb, etc?
[20:37] <scellef> mrec: grep -R LC_LANG /home?
[20:37] <scellef> :D
[20:37] <ozy_work> Sazpaimon: why wouldn't it?
[20:38] <Sazpaimon> why would a server need wireless?
[20:38] <ozy_work> Sazpaimon: why wouldn't it?
[20:38] <Sazpaimon> that is to say, wireless by default
[20:38] <ozy_work> *shrug*
[20:38] <mrec> scellef: nope
[20:38] <mrec> those locales are the biggest failure in the linux world
[20:39] <ozy_work> Sazpaimon: in my mind 'server' denotes stability/feature freezes/long term support, not 'limited features'
[20:39] <Wizek> MonkeyDust: Someone suggests purging the reverse dependencies. I'd like to give that a try, but it sounds like something potentially harmful. Or is it completely safe?
[20:39] <ozy_work> then again, i'm not really a ubuntu guy (joined because of the countdown clock)
[20:39] <scellef> mrec: d'oh :(
[20:40] <Sazpaimon> ozy_work, so in your opinion, server == hardened

[20:40] <MonkeyDust> Wizek  it's only wubi, not much lost if things go wrong, give it a try
[20:41] <Pici> Sazpaimon: Everything that is installable in Ubuntu Desktop can be installed on Ubuntu server. So yes, you can get wireless working.
[20:42] <Wizek> MonkeyDust: in what way can It go wrong? What should I be expecting?
[20:42] <Sazpaimon> Pici, my question is why does it need to be *installed* from the get-go
[20:42] <Sazpaimon> i mean if you need wireless, apt-get install wireless-tools, by all means. But a server install does not need such a thing out of the box
[20:44] <Pici> Sazpaimon: Probably because it was small enough to include by default and not cause a problem.

[20:50] <Wizek> MonkeyDust: I owe you an apology. It does have to do with wubi, so sorry for doubting you on that one. But, fortunatelly, there was a very easy solution: "sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386" ia32-libs is installing right now, fingers crossed for skype and steam :) after that
[20:51] <Sazpaimon> ozy_work, I just think that something like wireless-tools could be installed from something like tasksel, instead of by default, but that's just me
[20:51] <MonkeyDust> Wizek  no problem, but maybe you can add a comment to the launchpad page
[20:52] <ozy_work> Sazpaimon: perhaps. In my mind, you should be starting with a miminal install then, and build up the packages you want
[20:52] <ozy_work> i'm not sure what tasksel is

[21:36] <joako> jhutchins_wk: The issue is no the interface. THe issue is if I don´t launch from the GUI there is no audio output

[21:38] <joako> usr13: I am trying to run VLC a service. When I run VLC as a service or through SSH there is no sound output. WHen I run VLC from the GUI there is sound output
[21:38] <dlynes_laptop> blno, #ubuntu-discuss
[21:38] <jhutchins_wk> joako: That would be reasonable.  Your audio system is essentialy owned by the local GUI.  If you launch a GUI app remotely the display is forwarded, but the GUI already has control of the local sound.
[21:38] <blno> dlynes_laptop: thanks
[21:38] <joako> And I just ran MPG123 from SSH and again there is no sound output
[21:38] <zirpu> anyone had ethernet and wifi disappear after the latest update to network-manager-gnome ?
[21:38] <jhutchins_wk> joako: You would have to trigger the GUI app to launch in the existing local session.  There are ways to do that, but I don't know them.
[21:38] <DJones> blno: The discussion has been moved to #ubuntu-phone
[21:39] <joako> Previously I had openSUSE and I could run VLC as a service
[21:39] <blno> DJones: great, thanks
[21:39] <jhutchins_wk> joako: On the other hand, text based apps are not using X forwarding, and they can often access the mixer on the local system (as above with mpg123).
[21:39] <dlynes_laptop> DJones, thanks for the update....been sending everyone to #ubuntu-discuss :)
[21:39] <joako> I never said I was using x forwarding. And I said MPG123 also does not output audio
[21:40] <joako> What if I just didn´t want a GUI? I Could not use audio?
[21:40] <usr13> joako: That is normal.  The audio will originate [only] from the local PC.
[21:40] <jhutchins_wk> joako: Supposedly one of the reasons for pulseaudio is that you can run a -local- app on your machine and forward the sound to the output of a remote machine.  Again, I don't have details.
[21:40] <joako> usr13: So what is needed to enable the sound?
[21:40] <jhutchins_wk> joako: Investigate why mpg123 isn't working.  Does the user have permission to access /dev/dsp?
[21:41] <jhutchins_wk> joako: Are you running pulse or straight ALSA?
=== HeKToN is now known as HeKToN|away
[21:41] <joako> jhutchins_wk: I am using the same user for the GUI and SSH. And I am using whatever is the default in Ubuntu 12.04
[21:42] <usr13> joako: The should should be heard on the pc that the app runs on.  Now, from a ssh session to another PC,  you may not even be able to run a gui app like vlc without first setting the display to the local machine with command:  export DISPLAY=:0.0  After that you should be able to run a gui app on the remote PC.
[21:43] <joako> usr13: VLC doesn´t need a GUI and that doesn´t explan why CLI-only mpg123 doesn´t work.
[21:44] <joako> I used to have openSUSE and I could run VLC as a service with the HTTP interface just fine and audio would come out of the machine´s sound card. Now in ubutnu I can not get sound as a service, or from SSH basically it has to be done MANUALLY from the local GUI.
[21:44] <usr13> joako: mpg123 should work as well, yes, and the audio should be heard on the PC that the app resides on.  Maybe you just need to turn up the volume.  Try alsamixer.
[21:45] <Jordan_U> joako: Pulseaudio automatically routs sound to the same place that $DISPLAY is going. You can also manually direct it to a remote machine.
[21:45] <vinceakavince> hey yall i dont know if this is where i should ask about having trouble installing ubuntu or not. but im having some difficulties
[21:45] <joako> Jordan_U: I don´t know what that means. There isn´t a display so maybe that´s the problem
[21:45] <randomuser33> Hello Ubuntu gawds, quick question...Would the latest version of ubuntu read exFat out of the box or would I need to install a package?
[21:46] <k1l_> !ask | vinceakavince
[21:46] <ubottu> vinceakavince: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[21:46] <Jordan_U> joako: $DISPLAY is the variable related to X which tells applications which X Display (which doesn't neccessarily correspond to a physical display) to send commands to.
[21:46] <joako> usr13: Just turned up the volume to max on everythign and still nothing
[21:47] <Jordan_U> joako: It's basically (though not quite) the only difference between "ssh foo@bar" and "ssh -X foo@bar".
[21:47] <usr13> joako: Jordan_U is addressing your issue .
[21:47] <bekks> randomuser33: Looks like you have to install fuse-exfat for using exfat.
[21:47] <zirpu> here's a fun bug:  install arping and it uninstalls network-manager.  that was fun.
[21:47] <joako> Jordan_U: So what should I put in /etc/init/vlc.conf upstart script so audio will play?
[21:47] <randomuser33> Oh okay. I assumed I would have to do someting. Thanks! bekks
[21:48] <Jordan_U> joako: So the first thing I would try is "ssh -X foo@bar" then running mpg123 within that ssh session, though I'm not sure that will work as I haven't tried it before.
[21:48] <iceroot> zirpu: you created a bug for that already?

[21:51] <Jordan_U> joako: Then you're probably not going to be able to get this working automatically via ssh, because you need some network routable sound system to get the sound from the PC running mpeg123 to the machine you're sitting in front of, and pulseaudio is pretty much it for that. Though pulseaudio can be installed and used in Windows, I doubt that it integrates nicely with ssh clients to automatically route sound.

[21:52] <dcrouch> Hello everyone.
[21:52] <easy_err> hi, i have a compaq presario cq56, with a realtek rtl8191se 802.11b/g/n wifi adapter. I'm using Easypeasy OS based on ubuntu. I manage to connect to the wireless network but i'm unable to access any page whatsoever nor am I able to login to skype, empathy etc. any idea please?
[21:52] <joako> Jordan_U: I think you misunderstood me. I don´t want to direct the audio anywhere. SSH is just a test. I want VLC to run as a service and I want the audio to come from the local machine´s sound card
[21:52] <joako> But the same issue when I ssh is that audio is not output
[21:53] <dcrouch> Is there a way to get into single-user mode to reset root password on a local machine if fast boot options are enabled?   (No splash screen or anything at prompt, we just land in login menu).
[21:53] <usr13> joako: Have you tested the sound system?  If not, try play: /usr/share/sounds/alsa/*
[21:54] <usr13> joako: Have you tested the sound system?  If not, try:   play /usr/share/sounds/alsa/*
[21:54] <Jordan_U> joako: Ahh, then I think you're running into a security problem. By default only the user at the active tty can output sound (so for example if you switch users, the old user's apps won't be able to play sound until you switch back to it).
[21:54] <joako> usr13: When I login via the GUI I can run VLC and everything plays fine, But when I run mpg123 or VLC from an SSH session.... or from an upstart script then there is no audio
[21:54] <Jordan_U> joako: And it's not based on UID (though I don't know exactly what it is based on).
[21:55] <lahwran> does anyone have a fresh install of ubuntu handy? would you tell me if it has the python-twisted package installed?
[21:55] <joako> Jordan_U: So what file do I need to chmod 777 to allow the audio from anywhere?
[21:55] <Jordan_U> joako: I can think of an ugly hack which will probably work though (and also may help you examine the situation to find out how to do this properly).
[21:56] <brendan_> is there a way to specify the directory in which a package via apt-get is installed to?
[21:56] <joako> Jordan_U: Please do go on
[21:56] <brendan_> ie: going to be using apt-get to install libyaml-dev, but would like it to go to /usr/local
[21:56] <Jordan_U> joako: Try opening a terminal on the physical machine, and start screen. Then ssh in and "screen -x" to connect to that screen session and run mpeg123 from there.
[21:57] <usr13> joako: That is an anomaly.  What is the OS?
[21:57] <joako> Jordan_U: 1) I don´t have access to the screen right now. 2) How would i do that from a startup script?
[21:57] <joako> usr13: Ubuntu 12.04
[21:57] <Jordan_U> joako: If that works, you can examine the differences between the environment inside and outside the screen session to maybe figure out how to do this properly.
[21:58] <usr13> joako: export DISPLAY=:0.0
[21:59] <joako> Can I remove pulse audio and use something else?
[21:59] <vinceakavince> im here on a friends pc. my computer that i want ubuntu on doesnt have a working browser. i downloaded the ubuntu 12.10 iso file, ran the universal usb installer.exe and formatted the usb and all that. restarted my computer, went to the boot options, selected the usb, and its saying "no configuration file found"

[22:02] <usr13> joako: Try alsamixer
[22:03] <jonasthomas_> I have a dump question.  I'm running 10.04 and supposedly libgl1-mesa-glx 7.10.1-0ubuntu2 will cure all sort of problems
[22:03] <jonasthomas_> currently I have 7.7.1-1ubuntu3.1 in 10.04   Is there a way to back port this into 10.04 or is this going to force me into 12.04?

[22:03] <joako> usr13: Yes when I run alsamixer I set the volumes to max
[22:03] <usr13> joako: Did you try  play /usr/share/sounds/alsa/*  ?
[22:03] <joako> I try to remove pulseaudio but it trys to remove others like gnome-session and vlc
[22:04] <joako> usr13: No but I tried mpg123 http://some/stream
[22:04] <usr13> joako: Try  play /usr/share/sounds/alsa/*  ?
[22:04] <easy_err> i cannot ping anything
[22:05] <jrtappers> Not addresses or IP's?
[22:05] <usr13> easy_err: What are you trying to ping?  IP addresses, or domain names?
[22:06] <Jordan_U> joako: Try "pasuspender mpeg123 foo.mp3" as that will suspend pulseaudio and have mpeg123 talk directly to alsa.
[22:06] <brendan_> is there a way to specify the directory in which a package via apt-get is installed to? ie: using like --prefix= when doing a source install so i can specify the path for the  apt-get install libyaml-dev?
[22:06] <usr13> easy_err: I can't "ping anything"  either, but I CAN ping a valid domain name and I can ping IP addresses that exist on my LAN.
[22:07] <usr13> brendan_: Not that I know of....
[22:07] <Jordan_U> joako: If that also fails then pulseaudio probably isn't what's arbitrating access to the sound card for this security feature (or at least isn't the only thing arbitrating access).
[22:07] <jrtappers> easy_err: Have you got an IP adress from DCHP?
[22:07] <joako> Jordan_U: ¨Feautre¨ not feature

I mean, if I am writing a software, and would like it to be packaged for Ubuntu, what is the lowest Ubuntu release that I need to make sure my thing is compatible with?
[22:09] <brendan_> it may work as is, but was curious
[22:09] <jrtappers> Is my name showing as registered, I don't know if I did it right or not
[22:09] <usr13> jrtappers: see for yourself.
[22:10] <Muphrid> ggherdov: 10.04 LTS which will end its life in march or april. If you would like to package something it is better to contribute to debian instead, then it will flow to ubuntu

Then see what nameserver you are using, cat /etc/resolv.conf  It may be the router's IP and if so, you need to have your router's caching nameserver turned on and the router should have a valid nameserver from outside that it uses.  If not, or if you want to just sidestep all that, just 8.8.8.8  as your nameserver.

[22:46] <Robbilie> it simply doesnt "upstart" xD
[22:47] <usr13> Robbilie: Ok, well, I guess I'll take your word for it, but I didn't think it would matter.

[23:13] <gotwig> andural, alright ;) I am from German
[23:13] <gotwig> y
[23:13] <Robbilie> jrtappers, hear alot bout that will enable that now because my password is too insecure
[23:13] <Abhish> SailorMoon, run sudo lsmod | grep b43
[23:13] <andural> gotwig : originally dutch :)
[23:14] <Abhish> SailorMoon, The reason I'm asking these questions is that I'm rather intimate with issues pertaining to broadcom chipsets.
[23:15] <SailorMoon> i have it rebooting, just to see.
[23:15] <jrtappers> Robbilie, Public wifi is insecure, so twofactor is needed, passwords c an be sniffed
=== d is now known as Guest86380
=== redrocket[Den] is now known as redrocket
[23:15] <andural> gotwig I manage to get to a different graphical login, which lets me type username/password and then does nothing
[23:15] <SailorMoon> Yeah, it isnt working, Abhish
[23:15] <Freeder> whats the best way to figure out what is causing a high system load? top doesn't show the culprit, its all at 0%
[23:16] <vinceakavince> im installing ubuntu 12.10 desktop on my computer alongside my windows xp (this is a friends computer im chatting on). its asking me to partition drive space. is that just asking how much of my hard drive do i want to use for windows and how much for ubuntu? or what? also is that something i can change in the future?
[23:16] <jrtappers> Freeder, sudo top
[23:16] <jrtappers> vinceakavince, why not wubi?
[23:16] <Freeder> I'm already running it as root
[23:17] <DominikST95> vinceakavince, partitions can be changed later, but it may be that some data gets lost
[23:17] <jrtappers> vinceakavince, OH yh, XP = no wubi, sorry
[23:17] <DominikST95> (if you do it wrong)
[23:17] <gotwig> andural, can you get to the ubuntu lightdm?
[23:17] <Robbilie> jrtappers, enabled :)
[23:17] <toordog>  jrtappers what about 7 then :)
[23:17] <Robbilie> jrtappers, now going to add a new pw additionally
[23:18] <andural> gotwig no.  doing a 'service start lightdm' gets me to this odd graphical login
[23:18] <SailorMoon> Abhish: simply typing "sudo modprobe b43" makes my wireless card work. what should i do to make it load at boot?
[23:19] <vinceakavince> hmm, how might i do it wrong? lol now youve got me worried. is there anything i should watch out for, or what would cause loss of data?
[23:19] <gotwig> andural, so the normal lightdm...?
[23:19] <gotwig> andural, the phrase before you are loged in
[23:20] <toordog> vinceakavince: just that resizing a partition is never 100% safe
[23:20] <VlanX> WeThePeople:  http://pastebin.com/KSYJ8Ncw
[23:20] <jrtappers> toordog, Please can you remind me, my chat history is a bit broken
[23:20] <andural> gotwig, I don't know, I haven't seen this one before.  The usual lightdm login looks different than what I get now.
[23:20] <toordog> jrtappers: I keep losing you :P
[23:20] <jrtappers> Oh, security tip, Use XARP
[23:20] <Abhish> b43... how is the performance? I usually have to blacklist that driver.
[23:20] <andural> gotwig I get this one http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pzVKVDOIYcQ/TNuIGKArGbI/AAAAAAAAFF4/eXHZ5RCL8Lc/s1600/LightDM+Industrial.png
[23:20] <vinceakavince> toordog: oh ok well thanks for the heads up
[23:20] <Abhish> All you should need to do is blacklist brcmsmac and wl.
[23:20] <DominikST95> if you for example try to make a full partition smaller, some data will be erased
[23:20] <Abhish> SailorMoon, ^
[23:21] <andural> gotwig but logging in does nothing, it just puts me back at that screen
[23:21] <Kuhrect> can any one help me install skype on ubuntu??
[23:21] <gotwig> andural, are you serious^^?
[23:21] <WeThePeople> vlanx, what dist?
[23:21] <jrtappers> toordog, I am back in the conversation flow
[23:22] <gotwig> andural, I think I know about your problem
[23:22] <VlanX> WeThePeople: 12.10
[23:22] <Abhish> SailorMoon, udev handles driver loading. Blacklist the offending drivers and it should act fine.
[23:22] <Abhish> Kuhrect, is it available in the app store?
[23:22] <toordog> jrtappers: i was just saying earlier that hacker shown so well that internet is not secure that now USA want to pass law to control the internet ;)
[23:22] <andural> gotwig that would be nice :)
[23:22] <gotwig> andural, you would have to remove some hiden .Xauthority files I guesss
[23:22] <gotwig> they are somehow corrupted
[23:22] <gotwig> or invalid
[23:22] <Abhish> If not, download it and install it. The package manager will make sure it works.
[23:22] <andural> gotwig interesting.  where are those normally located?  and, any idea how that happened?
[23:22] <gotwig> in your home directory
[23:23] <jrtappers> Its insecure, but only humans make mistakes
[23:23] <andural> gotwig hmm okay.
[23:23] <gotwig> andural, before that create a new user on terminal
[23:23] <az_> hello, i am trying to install a downloaded driver for radeon 2400. I can't seem to figure out to do so. Any help?
[23:23] <gotwig> andural, to test, if it has to do with that... I dont have much time, 00:23 AM here =)
[23:23] <jrtappers> toordog, SSL can be beaten, passwords can be sniffed so there are still security mountains to climb, but a MITM is always a problem
[23:24] <gotwig> andural, do you know how?
[23:24] <andural> gotwig yes
[23:24] <andural> gotwig I used to be able to fix this until they switched away from the old xorg system
[23:24] <plut0> ubuntu is booting up in the recovery menu every reboot, filesystem state = read-only, any idea how to fix this?
[23:24] <SailorMoon> Abhish: how do i blacklist them? D:
[23:24] <gotwig> plut0, yeah
[23:25] <gotwig> plut0, so, do you want to become write rights first?
[23:25] <impiza> hi any programmer
[23:25] <jrtappers> toordog, But the internet is hard to police, and thats part of its brilliance and part of the problem
[23:25] <impiza> i want a little help
[23:25] <impiza> plz pm me
[23:25] <plut0> gotwig: / is read-write, its a bogus message
[23:25] <gotwig> impiza, whats up...
[23:25] <ESphynx> guys... all my panels are gone :| help please? I tried to reinstall gnome-panel it doesn't help :S
[23:26] <impiza> off topic gotwig
[23:26] <gotwig> plut0, so do you want to know how to mount it writeable?
[23:26] <impiza> plz pm me
[23:26] <andural> gotwig that worked, thank you :)
[23:26] <plut0> gotwig: it is writable...
[23:26] <gotwig> impiza, spammer -..-
[23:26] <VlanX> WeThePeople: do you think it would be possible to enable graphic acceleration?
[23:26] <ESphynx> also now ctrl-alt-f1/f2 is completely messed up while X is running... the console only comes back after I ctrl-C my 'startx'
[23:26] <Muphrid> SailorMoon: add it to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
[23:26] <impiza> o_O
[23:26] <gotwig> andural, with your normal user?
[23:26] <jrtappers> What languages can Ubuntu software center apps be made in?
[23:26] <gotwig> andural, I am happy as well :-)
[23:27] <schultza> how do i add a folder to the the nautilus sidebar?
[23:27] <gotwig> plut0, so you want to start  without recovery?
[23:27] <plut0> gotwig: yes
[23:27] <Appiano> hi guys i run ubuntu 12 i installed foxit reader but it comes out in chinese, could somebody help me? i need to use it for my thesis tomorrow morning, please! how do i change the language of the software, i looked it up online and found nothing, thanks
[23:28] <gotwig> plut0, does it start in normal mode when you select it?
[23:28] <plut0> gotwig: yeah it boots fine, just comes up with the recovery console every reboot
[23:28] <schultza> ah, nevermind
[23:28] <az_> ok, so there are no drivers technically, weird...
[23:28] <jrtappers> schultza,  do you mean bookmarks
[23:28] <gotwig> plut0, try to get grub to generate all your entries new
[23:28] <plut0> gotwig: update-grub, did that already
[23:29] <deltab> Appiano: specifically foxit, or would another pdf reader do?
[23:29] <Jordan_U> Appiano: There are many other PDF readers available. Do you need to use Foxit?
[23:29] <gotwig> plut0, have you written the changes on the disk?
[23:29] <plut0> gotwig: yes
[23:29] <deltab> Appiano: you probably have evince installed already
[23:30] <gotwig> plut0, first grub-mkconfig than grub-update, than grub-setup diskname or grub-install diskname
[23:30] <Jordan_U> plut0: What is the output of "cat /proc/cmdline" when it boots this way?
[23:30] <kysstfafm> is he a GOG gamer?
[23:30] <gotwig> I always forget if its grub-setup or install... try both
[23:30] <Appiano> I found out that the search function works a lot quicker with Foxit. do you suggest any alternative?
[23:30] <DominikST95> how can i update my ATI HD 4870 driver? No tutorial on the internet worked -.-
[23:30] <gotwig> plut0, grub-install diskname that is
[23:31] <gotwig> plut0, have you run grub-mkconfig before?

[23:31] <provenzano> hey guys did some1 used DSL on usb?
[23:31] <k1l_> DominikST95: why you want to update?
[23:32] <plut0> gotwig: tried those commands, no luck
[23:32] <Jordan_U> gotwig: grub-update isn't a command, update-grub is a wrapper around grub-mkconfig, grub-setup is a utility that shouldn't be run manually, grub-install is OK to run manually but doesn't need to be to update the grub.cfg. Most importantly though you should never suggest that people run commands without knowing what they actually do, especially for something as important as the bootloader.
[23:32] <k1l_> provenzano: dsl like in damnsmalllinux?
[23:32] <provenzano> yes
[23:32] <gotwig> Jordan_U, oh well
[23:32] <DominikST95> try to take part in the Steam beta
[23:32] <k1l_> provenzano: better try the dsl support for that

[23:32] <gotwig> Jordan_U, I know what happens in all cases, sir
[23:32] <SailorMoon> how do i go about using gedit with admin/root privs?
[23:33] <Jordan_U> gotwig: Clearly not, or you wouldn't have given the recommendation that you did.
[23:33] <DominikST95> and the driver i have doesn't support a specific OpenGL function...
[23:33] <deltab> Appiano: firefox and chrome both have built-in pdf support now; I don't know how fast the searching is
[23:33] <gotwig> plut0, where are you from?
[23:33] <SailorMoon> nvm figured it out
[23:33] <k1l_> SailorMoon: you can use gksudo
[23:33] <gotwig> Jordan_U, bye
[23:34] <gotwig> duno why I am even here :/
[23:34] <Jordan_U> plut0: For some reason "recovery" is in the linux cmdline. Can you pastebin your /etc/default/grub?
[23:34] <plut0> Jordan_U: i fixed it
[23:34] <SailorMoon> "this file is autogenerated by bcmwl. all changes to this file will be lost"? Its blacklisting my driver
[23:34] <ESphynx> it's thinking I have 2 screens or something :S
[23:35] <az_> what would you guys say is the best source for a new linux/ubuntu user information?
[23:35] <Jordan_U> !manual | az_
[23:35] <Sling> az_: what kind of information do you mean?
[23:35] <ubottu> az_: The Ubuntu Manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels of experience. http://ubuntu-manual.org/
[23:36] <SailorMoon> Abhish "this file is autogenerated by bcmwl. all changes to this file will be lost"? Its blacklisting my driver

[23:47] <yacc> Just wondered, (and despite the sound of it, I'm not trolling), but Ubuntu seems to be the master of mobile vapor-ware, I mean, Ubuntu/Android => no downloads for existing hardware, no custom hardware for it, and now basically the same with "Ubuntu for Smartphones"? *sign*
[23:47] <yacc> *sigh*
[23:47] <machicola> yea, tbh, it seems kinda cool a lot of it.... just gotta check it out i guess
[23:52] <xui34> does anyone know of a storage device which will show up on a network as a printer and then store print jobs sent to it (rather than printing them)
[23:52] <dr_willis> xui34:  cant say ive ever seen that done.  You could use the various 'print to file'  or the pdf-printer printerdriver thing.
[23:53] <hanasaki> how do you get a virtual kvm machine to network so it can get an dhcp address from the network instead of being NAT through kvm?
[23:53] <dr_willis> if my printer is offline the server just queus them up. :)
[23:53] <hanasaki> it used to work.. then I upgraded to the most current ubuntu
[23:53] <xui34> dr_willis: yea- I was thinking of doing that... wouldn't be as convenient
[23:53] <Guest30104> any answer for this question ?: I'm am trying to find my way around the compatibility problems Linux O/S have with Adobe Creative suite Programs. Can Ubuntu read Apple drivers? I have an apple based version of Adobe Creative Suite and was wondering if it would be possible to install these programs on Ubuntu.
[23:54] <Jordan_U> Guest30104: No, Ubuntu cannot run applications written for OSX.
[23:55] <dr_willis> xui34:  its not real clear on whyyou are doing this. perhaps pthers may hae ideas if you give more details
[23:56] <dr_willis> Guest30104:  you dont run apple software on linux. SOME windows apps can work with wine.
[23:56] <MMavipc> Getting into the phone business, eh?
[23:56] <dr_willis> Guest30104:  i dont thinkthe term 'drivers' is correct in what you said. ;)
[23:56] <Guest30104> dr_willis just copied an old question
[23:56] <dr_willis> Guest30104:  You dont run Apple Apps on Linux.
[23:57] <dr_willis> 'reading drivers'  vague. and most likely a NO also. ;)
[23:57] <dr_willis> Not all Adobe apps work in Wine either.
[23:57]  * dr_willis covers all the bases

=== tenach is now known as cptmashek
[23:58] <xui34> dr_willis: i run a tech shop and order lots of parts... right now i just send the receipts right to a laser printer. there are other ways to do this (samba, etc) and a network area storage device. however i'd prefer to just go to file print -> and select the printer rather than have to browse for the location of the network area storage device.
[23:58] <dr_willis> work time for me... bbl
[23:58] <jrib> xui34: you could print to file and then probably set the default location for those files to some network device
[23:58] <zoie> hello, how can i record the sound that's coming out of my computer?
[23:59] <jrib> xui34: I imagine you can do what you proposed originally too though I have no experience with that
[23:59] <xui34> jrib: i could; was hoping to find a device though that acted as a fake printer which was easy to add like a typical hp printer is. i'm frequently running from CD/and or various computers.
