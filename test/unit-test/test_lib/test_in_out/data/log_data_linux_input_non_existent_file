p92
aS'[15:31] <ScottK> shadeslayer: I think that\'s an "ask barry" problem.\n'
p93
aS'[15:31] <shadeslayer> heh okay\n'
p94
aS'[15:32] <yofel> synaptiks does support py3 does it?\n'
p95
aS"[15:32] <shadeslayer> I think I want to poke this a bit before asking him, need to understand what's causing this in the first place\n"
p96
aS"[15:32] <shadeslayer> yofel: I don't think so\n"
p97
aS"[15:32] <yofel> shadeslayer: well, your former backtrace was using python 3.3 libs, so that's probably the issue\n"
p98
aS'[15:32] <yofel> as kpythonpluginfactory in raring is linked against py33\n'
p99
aS"[15:33] <yofel> if you just run it by hand you'll probably use py2\n"
p100
aS'[15:33] <shadeslayer> former? the backtrace is the same I think\n'
p101
aS'[15:34] <yofel> http://paste.kde.org/635594/ shows /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.3m.so.1.0\n'
p102
aS'[15:34] <yofel> your updated trace only shows the source files, not the lib names\n'
p103
aS'[15:35] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'
p104
aS'[15:36] <shadeslayer> this is what I get when I go through systemsettings > input devices > touchpad : http://paste.kde.org/~shadeslayer/635690/\n'
p105
aS'[15:37] <yofel> same stacktracetop from what I see\n'
p106
aS'[15:37] <shadeslayer> yeah\n'
p107
aS'[15:37] <shadeslayer> yofel: funny thing is, when you run synaptiks ( the binary ) and choose touchpad settings, it works\n'
p108
aS'[15:38] <shadeslayer> probably because it forces python2?\n'
p109
aS"[15:38] <yofel> iirc 'python' is still python2 in raring\n"
p110
aS"[15:38] <yofel> can't check right now\n"

aS'[15:39] <yofel> hum\n'

aS"[15:39] <shadeslayer> I wonder if there's a way to force python2 in the KCM\n"
p116
aS'[15:44] <yofel> no idea. IIRC userconfig has the same problem\n'
p117
aS'[15:46] <shadeslayer> yofel: yeah, looks like a python3 issue\n'
p118
aS'[15:46] <shadeslayer> almost similar stack trace\n'
p119
aS'[15:47] <yofel> with synaptiks AFAIK being unmaintained though this is a larger problem though, maybe we could talk to the dev about having a py3 branch on github\n'
p120
aS'[15:47] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/~shadeslayer/635708/\n'
p121
aS'[15:47] <shadeslayer> yofel: from what I read on the github issue tracker, he was looking for new maintainers a year ago\n'
p122
aS"[15:47] <yofel> yeah, it's RFA, but I haven't seen any progress there...\n"
p123
aS"[15:49] <yofel> As a start we would have to first build the module for python3 though, that shouldn't be too much work\n"

p217
aS'[19:15] <Quintasan> even better\n'
p218
aS'[19:15] <shadeslayer> yes, but do we also need to rebuild everything that deps on tp logger qt?\n'
p219
aS'[19:16] <shadeslayer> wrong package name ?\n'
p220
aS'[19:16] <Quintasan> Dunno, but I guess that would be the safe approach\n'

p235
aS"[19:18] <Quintasan> I don't think I can touch the first 3\n"
p236
aS'[19:19] <shadeslayer> question is, do we wait for the package to get kicked from debian new? \n'
p237
aS'[19:19] <shadeslayer> because so version Changed \n'
p238
aS"[19:19] <Quintasan> If we do then I won't have to do anything (probaby)\n"
p239
aS'[19:19] <shadeslayer> hence package name Changed, etc etc\n'
p240
aS"[19:20] <Quintasan> I'd wait and see what happens\n"
p241
aS'[19:20] <shadeslayer> idk, ktp text ui is unusable at the moment\n'
p242
aS"[19:20] <Quintasan> It can't break EVERYTHING and if something happens it should be rather easy to fix\n"
p243
aS'[19:20] <shadeslayer> weird situation \n'

aS'[19:21] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: if you want to rebuild we would have to go around and ask maintainers of empaty and gnome-shell to make a rebuild right now\n'

aS"[19:27] <shadeslayer> ScottK: sure, but there's a package in debian new, when that gets syncd we get to rebuild again\n"

p928
aS'[21:45] <Quintasan> it jumps 4 elements\n'
p929
aS'[21:45] <Quintasan> at first I thought it would jump 8 elements but I dismissed it as dumb\n'
p930
aS'[21:46] <Quintasan> then I thought it would jump 2 elemnts since float size is 4 and we are adding 8\n'
p931
aS'[21:46] <Quintasan> but it jumped 4 elements\n'
p932
aS'[21:46] <Quintasan> what the\n'

p934

p935

p936
aS'[21:48] <Quintasan> hmm\n'
p937
aS'[21:48] <Quintasan> the tasks asks you exactly\n'
p938
aS'[21:49] <Quintasan> copypasta in polish\n'
p939

p940
aS'[21:49] <Quintasan> nPtr+8? Jaka znajduje si\xc4\x99 tam warto\xc5\x9b\xc4\x87?\n'
p941
aS'[21:49] <Quintasan> Assuming\n'
p942
aS'[21:49] <Quintasan> nPtr is pointing the the beggining of the array\n'
p943
aS'[21:49] <Quintasan> to what address is nPtr+8 pointing to, what value is stored there\n'
p944
aS"[21:49] <Quintasan> He doesn't do *(nPtr+8) there\n"
p945
aS'[21:50] <Quintasan> I imagine those to be wildly different since what I was to cout << nPtr+8 and it gave the address of the 4 element of the array\n'
p946
aS'[21:50] <yofel_> as nPtr is a pointer to float, it should be the same as 8*sizeof(float) if it were void*\n'
p947
aS'[21:51] <Quintasan> lol\n'
p948
aS'[21:51] <Quintasan> so we are actually adding 24?\n'
p949
aS'[21:51] <yofel_> internally yes\n'
p950
aS'[21:51] <Quintasan> if float is 4 bytes\n'
p951
aS'[21:53] <Quintasan> sooo\n'
p952
aS'[21:54] <Quintasan> if I put it indexes it would be a jump from liczby[0] to liczby[4]\n'
p953
aS'[21:54] <Quintasan> right?\n'
p954
aS'[21:56] <yofel_> give me a bit to make sense of what gcc is throwing at me here\n'
p955
aS'[21:56] <yofel_> wait\n'
p956
aS'[21:56] <yofel_> nvm\n'
p957
aS'[21:56] <yofel_> 8 * 4 = 32\n'
p958
aS'[21:56] <Quintasan> wat\n'
p959
aS'[21:56] <Quintasan> really\n'
p960
aS'[21:57] <yofel_> so 863806976 + 8 = 863807008 \n'
p961
aS'[21:57]  * Quintasan needs to learn multiplying\n'
p962
aS'[21:57] <yofel_> in float pointer arithmetic\n'
p963
aS'[21:58] <Quintasan> sooooo\n'
p964
aS'[21:59] <Quintasan> TBH I though adding 8 would make it point to the curr_adress+2\n'
p965
aS'[21:59] <Quintasan> since float is 4 bytes\n'
p966
aS"[22:00] <Quintasan> now it turns out it's actually adding 32 to the adress and that is probably after the array boundary\n"
p967
aS'[22:00] <yofel_> no\n'
p968
aS'[22:00] <yofel_> addr + 4 in plain bytes would be libczby[1]\n'
p969
aS'[22:01] <yofel_> addr + 32 is liczby[8]\n'
p970
aS"[22:01] <yofel_> note that you're defining nPtr as *float\n"
p971
aS'[22:01] <yofel_> if you want it to count in 1 byte steps use *void\n'
p972
aS'[22:01] <yofel_> as it takes the data size into account\n'
p973
aS"[22:02] <yofel_> that's why I said it does + sizeof(type) internally\n"
p974
aS'[22:02] <Quintasan> so nPtr+8 is actually *(nPtr+32) ?\n'
p975
aS'[22:02] <yofel_> + val*sizeof(type)\n'
p976
aS'[22:02] <yofel_> nPtr + 8 as flot would be nPtr + 32 as void\n'
p977
aS'[22:06] <Quintasan> so assuming nPtr i pointing at liczby[0]\n'
p978
aS'[22:06] <Quintasan> nPtr+8 will make it point to liczby[8]?\n'
p979
aS'[22:06] <Quintasan> this is...logical?\n'
p980
aS'[22:06] <Quintasan> I have no idea why they make a big deal out of this\n'
p981
aS"[22:07] <yofel_> uh... it's only logical if you know hat C takes he pointer type into account for pointer arithmetics\n"
p982
aS'[22:09] <Quintasan> it would be illogical if it didnt imo\n'

p986
aS'[22:10] <Quintasan> is this correct?\n'
p987
aS'[22:10] <Quintasan> st is a pointer\n'
p988
aS'[22:10] <yofel_> yeah\n'
p989
aS'[22:10]  * Quintasan always confuses the damn symbols\n'
p990
aS'[22:10] <Quintasan> int *st; is easy it creates a pointer\n'
p991
aS'[22:10] <Quintasan> what the hell does *st = 100 do?\n'
p992
aS'[22:11] <yofel_> put 100 into the memory that st points to\n'
p993
aS'[22:11] <Quintasan> but st doesnt point at anything\n'

aS'[14:17] <Quintasan> ScottK, Riddell: turns out installing anthy ins jp_JP locale did the ibus configuration magic itself\n'
p1164
aS"[14:18] <Quintasan> Therfore ScottK's proposed solution of making each langpack depend on ibus is the best solution imo\n"
p1165
aS'[14:18] <Quintasan> I would even go a step ahead and pull the module for ex. ibus-pinyin for chinese langpack\n'

p1180
aS'[14:28] <Quintasan> Riddell: it seems ibus doesnt automatically enable input methods for certain languages unless your locale is that certain language\n'
p1181
aS'[14:28] <Quintasan> i.e. when you run jp_JP.UTF8 locale installing ibus-anthy will do the magic itself\n'
p1182
aS'[14:28] <Riddell> yeah, nuts\n'
p1183
aS'[14:29] <Quintasan> but when you use for eg. pl_PL.UTF8 installing ibus-anthy will just pull all the required stuff but not configure ibus to use the Anthy input method\n'

aS'[14:29] <Quintasan> so to fix it I just need to modify langpacks deps\n'

p1196
aS"[14:33] <Quintasan> Yeah, but since it's modular it seems like it's only a matter of time\n"

aS'[10:20] <apachelogger> Riddell: shadeslayer wanted to look into porting\n'
p1381
aS'[10:21] <shadeslayer> uh yeah, maybe a couple of months down the line\n'
p1382
aS"[10:21] <shadeslayer> I'm looking into pgst right now\n"
p1383

p1385
aS'[10:21] <shadeslayer> or rather than months, once I finish pgst\n'
p1386
aS"[10:21] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: that's what I meant\n"
p1387
aS'[10:21] <Laney> shadeslayer: merci, will upload that stuff tomorrow\n'
p1388
aS'[10:21] <shadeslayer> sure\n'
p1389
aS'[10:21] <apachelogger> aka the question was who will port to gst1\n'
p1390
aS'[10:22] <shadeslayer> right\n'
p1391
aS'[10:22] <shadeslayer> from what I recall qgst needs porting first\n'
p1392
aS'[10:22] <apachelogger> Riddell: and yes they all need portery, which depending on whether those pieces of software do some sort of device listing it may be impossible to do :P\n'
p1393
aS'[10:22] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: pgst does not use qgst :P\n'
p1394
aS'[10:23] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: not pgst, i meant that in order to port ktp call ui qgst needs porting first\n'
p1395
aS'[10:23] <shadeslayer> since it uses qgst\n'
p1396
aS'[10:23] <apachelogger> ah yes\n'
p1397
aS'[10:23] <apachelogger> that makes sense\n'
p1398
aS"[10:24] <shadeslayer> not to mention gst1.0 is missing stuff so it'll contain workarounds till gst1.0 gets fixed\n"
p1399
aS'[10:24] <apachelogger> qtwebkit needs a direct port (i.e. I think it does not use qgst)\n'
p1400
aS'[10:24] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'
p1401
aS'[10:24] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: seeing you on IRC after quite some time\n'
p1402
aS"[10:25] <shadeslayer> didn't qtwebkit use phonon :P\n"
p1403
aS'[10:25] <apachelogger> the fact that gst1 is missing stuff is why i fear it may be hard to port some stuff at all\n'
p1404
aS'[10:25] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p1405
aS'[10:25] <apachelogger> as you essentially needed to implement direct device probing via alsa, pulse, whathaveyou\n'
p1406
aS'[10:25] <shadeslayer> yeah\n'
p1407
aS"[10:26] <shadeslayer> Trevor said that it's a acceptable workaround till gst1.0 gets fixed\n"
p1408
aS'[10:26] <shadeslayer> which I think is later this year\n'
p1409
aS'[10:26] <apachelogger> for phonon, yes, since we have the alsa probing in place\n'
p1410
aS'[10:26] <shadeslayer> *nod*\n'
p1411
aS'[10:26] <apachelogger> (that actually would also not be possible with phonon5 as that is supposed to have only backend driven probing ... hooray for gst1 trololo)\n'

p1593
aS"[21:57] <yofel> what's wrong with the wallpaper?\n"
p1594
aS"[21:57] <sheytan> there's only one? :)\n"
p1595
aS"[21:58] <sheytan> instead the 'install more' button, just add the default ones, or like ubuntu, make a contest to choose new :)\n"
p1596
aS"[21:58] <sheytan> what if you don't have internet access or are on 3G?\n"
p1597
aS'[21:58] <sheytan> like me\n'
p1598
aS"[21:58] <sheytan> i don't want to spent my trasfer on things that suppose to be already installed :)\n"
p1599
aS'[22:18] <yofel> the problem here is image space... the full kde-wallpapers tarball is 87MB now\n'
p1600
aS'[22:20] <allee> afiestas: is default behavior still the one you described in your blog video  screen management got magic?\n'
p1601
aS"[22:20] <allee> afiestas: for me external (vga) monitor is not automaticly actived (or the right).  It's in off mode. \n"
p1602
aS'[22:21] <allee> afiestas: windows on external screen are not moved to the laptop screen when external monitor is unplugged :-(\n'
p1603
aS'[22:21] <allee> Still much magic missing ;-)\n'
p1604
aS"[22:22] <afiestas> allee: you shouldn't use git snapshots, that kind of shit happen\n"
p1605
aS"[22:22] <yofel> and here I thought I'm the only one that needs xrandr to properly set his external monitor up\n"
p1606
aS'[22:22] <afiestas> we haven\'t said it is "package ready" but well it was to be expected I guess\n'
p1607
aS'[22:22] <afiestas> if you update ot latest master, it should work\n'
p1608
aS'[22:22] <afiestas> we have had some breakage and we still have some\n'
p1609
aS'[22:22] <afiestas> for example Wacom eats some X11 events\n'
p1610
aS"[22:23] <allee> afiestas: no offence intended!  I've updated ~ 2 hours ago to git master (lib)kscreen to get the fixes of my last bug report included.\n"
p1611
aS'[22:24] <afiestas> update everything always, not offence taken\n'
p1612
aS'[22:24] <afiestas> and disable wacom kded if you want "hot plug" to work \n'
p1613
aS"[22:25] <allee> afiestas: Ping me when it's a good time to sync pkgs with git in the meantime I work on the (not yet existing) quality of  the pkgs ;-)\n"
p1614
aS'[22:25]  * allee checks wacom stuff ...\n'
p1615
aS'[22:25] <afiestas> allee: as I said, package everything asap\n'
p1616
aS'[22:25] <afiestas> critical stuf is being touched/improved/broken one commit could work, the next one break everything\n'
p1617
aS'[22:27] <jessie_> afiestas: ARe you the maker of kscreen?\n'
p1618
aS"[22:28] <allee> afiestas: :-)   That's why I asked.  I don't want to waste time to create valuable bug report when you know that git is currently broken.    You can imply that I've tried with current master when I ask/report \n"
p1619
aS"[22:31] <yofel> shadeslayer: 4.10 for precise is done once you have time to backport indi, that seems to need some other libs backported and I don't have time to look at the risks right now\n"
p1620
aS"[22:37] <sheytan> yofell: we don't have to fit into a CD anymore ;)\n"
p1621
aS"[22:41] <yofel> it turns out that there's plenty of other things you can fill 1G with...\n"

p1808
aS'[15:51] <Darkwing> ronnoc: the only restriction (Unless they have changed it on Calligra side) is failure to save in the MS formats.\n'
p1809
aS'[15:53] <ronnoc> Darkwing: Right. Last I read, the team has no plans to incorporate saving in .doc formats, as a principle thing. But it is said to handle importing MS formats better than LO. \n'

p1811
aS"[15:54] <Riddell> ronnoc: it's not a point of principle, if someone implemented decent MS Office format saving they'd be happy for it\n"
p1812
aS'[15:54] <Darkwing> ronnoc: Aye, I understand that but, to allow principle things to get in teh way with functionality... My Uni and most work places don\'t understand "principle" behind no saving in MS formats. Until that changes I am stuck with LO\n'

aS'[12:04] <shadeslayer> https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/graphics/kolor-manager/repository\n'
p2243
aS'[12:04] <Riddell> nearly? :)\n'
p2244
aS'[12:05] <shadeslayer> that would need packaging I guess :)\n'
p2245
aS'[12:05] <oy> KWin-4.10 needs KolorServer to enable ICC colour correction\n'
p2246
aS'[12:05] <Riddell> oy: is there a release of KolorServer?\n'
p2247
aS"[12:05] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I've uploaded pimlibs with dep on nepomuk-core-dev :)\n"
p2248
aS'[12:06] <oy> Riddell, and shadeslayer yes we have packages\n'
p2249
aS'[12:06] <oy> https://www.oyranos.org/kolormanager/   on the bottom\n'
p2250
aS'[12:07] <shadeslayer> Should I trust the SSL cert? :P\n'
p2251
aS"[12:08] <shadeslayer> oy: I don't see a proper release\n"
p2252
aS'[12:08] <oy> KolorServer is part of KolorManager and both use ICC Examin + Oyranos + libXcm all inofficially packaged for debian\n'
p2253
aS'[12:09] <oy> shadeslayer, https://projects.kde.org/news/192 ?\n'
p2254
aS'[12:09] <Riddell> oy: presumably it needs packages of Oyranos first?\n'
p2255
aS'[12:09] <shadeslayer> yeah, I was about to open that link on projects.kde.org\n'
p2256
aS'[12:10] <shadeslayer> Riddell: yep : FIND_PACKAGE(Oyranos REQUIRED)\n'
p2257
aS'[12:10] <oy> Riddell, the dependencies are all packaged in the same way\n'
p2258
aS'[12:11] <oy> you can find the package list under xUbuntu: https://build.opensuse.org/project/monitor?project=multimedia%3Acolor_management\n'
p2259
aS"[12:13] <shadeslayer> I don't think we can use that packagign\n"
p2260
aS'[12:13] <shadeslayer> *packaging\n'
p2261
aS'[12:14] <oy> oh, why? I made it to help for Debian and Ubuntu\n'
p2262
aS'[12:15] <oy> shadeslayer, what can be done to improve?\n'
p2263
aS'[12:15] <shadeslayer> because it has a different format to what is actual packaging? IIRC OBS has this flat heiarchy packaging which is not valid debian packaging\n'
p2264
aS'[12:15] <shadeslayer> *actual debian packaging\n'
p2265
aS'[12:15] <apachelogger> (can be made actual debian packaging depending on how OBSy the packaging is...)\n'
p2266
aS'[12:16] <oy> I used a debian packaging tutorial\n'
p2267
aS'[12:16] <Riddell> shadeslayer: it seems like a good start\n'
p2268
aS'[12:16] <Riddell> oy: how much does this conflict with colord?\n'
p2269
aS'[12:17] <shadeslayer> OBS confuses me as hell\n'
p2270
aS'[12:17] <oy> I had them both running side by side, did not uninstall colord, works\n'
p2271
aS"[12:17] <shadeslayer> I don't even know where the packaging is so I can have a look\n"
p2272
aS'[12:18] <oy> shadeslayer, https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=kolor-manager&project=multimedia%3Acolor_management\n'
p2273
aS'[12:18] <oy> shadeslayer, you can click the package name in the monitor list\n'
p2274
aS'[12:18] <oy> agreed, it is different to launchpad\n'
p2275
aS'[12:21] <shadeslayer> looks sane from an overview, except that the copyright needs fixing ( 80 char width _\n'
p2276
aS'[12:21] <shadeslayer> *)\n'
p2277
aS'[12:21] <oy> will do, thanks\n'
p2278
aS"[12:22] <shadeslayer> I didn't know that OBS accepted this format\n"
p2279
aS'[12:22] <shadeslayer> I was only aware of the flat hiearchy one\n'
p2280
aS'[12:22] <oy> shadeslayer, I saw as well other formats, but because of the debian tutorial I choose that one\n'
p2281
aS'[12:22] <apachelogger> it is flat too :P\n'
p2282
aS'[12:23] <shadeslayer> oy: oh and maybe you can use dh $@ --with kde\n'
p2283
aS'[12:23] <oy> ok\n'
p2284
aS'[12:23] <shadeslayer> and remove the sample cruft in there as well\n'
p2285
aS'[12:24] <oy> shadeslayer, sample cruft? in which file?\n'
p2286
aS'[12:25] <shadeslayer> debian/rules\n'
p2287
aS'[12:25] <shadeslayer> "# Sample debian/rules that uses debhelper."\n'
p2288
aS'[12:25] <shadeslayer> not needed :)\n'
p2289
aS'[12:25] <oy> ah, see it, good\n'
p2290
aS"[12:27] <Riddell> oy: out of these packages in that OBS archive you're saying we want oyranos and kolor-manager in kubuntu?\n"
p2291
aS'[12:28] <oy> Riddell, yes, these + libXcm (dep) + ICC Examin (optionally used by KolorManager)\n'
p2292
aS'[12:29] <oy> "icc-profiles-free" is already in wheezy and I guess "xcalib" is available too, both are dependencies too\n'
p2293
aS"[12:30] <Riddell> oy: as someone who knows nothing about colour correction can you tell me why a window manager needs it?  isn't it better done for the whole monitor?\n"
p2294
aS'[12:31] <oy> Riddell, the WM manages all monitors, so it is ICC colour correction for the whole monitor\n'
p2295
aS'[12:32] <oy> Riddell, in the past we (X11) had only 1D LUT correction, which means no opt out, colorimetric based correction only for ICC supporting apps\n'
p2296
aS'[12:33] <oy> in the old LUT way, Dolphin does no colorimetric correction why DigiKam/Krita etc. do\n'
p2297
aS'[12:34] <oy> Riddell, with KWin ICC colour correction all apps are corrected together, including video on the GPU\n'
p2298
aS'[12:35] <oy> in the old LUT way, Dolphin does no colorimetric correction *while* DigiKam/Krita etc. do\n'
p2299
aS'[12:35] <Tm_T> oy: is the colour correction per-display?\n'
p2300
aS'[12:35] <oy> Tm_T, per output\n'
p2301
aS'[12:35] <oy> alias per monitor\n'
p2302
aS'[12:36] <Tm_T> oh good\n'
p2303
aS'[12:36] <Tm_T> so I have some hope to get reasonable results with external monitor and laptop\n'
p2304
aS'[12:37] <Riddell> oy: how is this different from colord-kde applying a profile to a monitor?\n'
p2305
aS'[12:37] <oy> Tm_T: yes that is one use case\n'
p2306
aS'[12:38] <oy> Riddell, colord-kde does only calibration, which is a 1D LUT\n'
p2307
aS'[12:39] <oy> Riddell, it does no correction for different primaries or saturation, calibration helps only in improving gray ramps, but that is covered by ICC profiles in KWin as well\n'
p2308
aS'[12:40] <oy> the 1D Lut this is very long available (perhaps 10 years). xcalib can do that for instance\n'
p2309
aS'[12:42] <oy> a calibration does not so much for small gamut laptops + attached sRGB/wide Gamut external monitors\n'
p2310
aS'[12:43] <Tm_T> ^\n'
p2311
aS'[12:44] <Riddell> oy: no 1.0 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/oyranos/files/Oyranos/ ?\n'
p2312
aS'[12:45] <oy> Riddell, not yet, we are still in beta and expect some minor changes\n'
p2313
aS'[12:45] <oy> btw. colord is guessedly beta too or alpha\n'
p2314
aS'[12:46] <Riddell> oy: but the OBS archive does have 1.0.0?\n'
p2315
aS'[12:46] <oy> Riddell, yes, of KolorManager, but not of its dependencies\n'
p2316
aS'[12:47] <Riddell> oh I see\n'
p2317
aS'[12:47] <oy> KolorManager exposes a limited set of features, we think we can garantee to remain stable\n'
p2318
aS"[12:47] <Riddell> oy: where's the place to download KolorManager sources?\n"
p2319
aS'[12:47] <oy> the Oyranos geature set is much broader\n'
p2320
aS'[12:48] <oy> Riddell, we hoped that git snapshots are fine? http://quickgit.kde.org/index.php?p=kolor-manager.git&a=tags\n'
p2321
aS'[12:49] <oy> for most of other packages there is: http://sourceforge.net/projects/oyranos/files/\n'
p2322
aS"[12:51] <Riddell> oy: that not quite kosher, KolorManager is ment to be 1.0 and stable but there's no tars?\n"
p2323
aS'[12:51] <Darkwing> Morning guys\n'
p2324
aS'[12:51] <oy> hmm, need to find a place for that\n'
p2325
aS'[12:52] <Riddell> oy: you can use ftp.kde.org or the same sourceforge project as oyranos no?\n'
p2326
aS'[12:52] <oy> ftp.kde.org would be sound\n'
p2327
aS'[12:53] <Riddell> oy: ask in #kde-sysadmin how you do that, I think you need to upload it somewhere then file a request on bugs.kde.org for sysadmin to move it to release\n'
p2328
aS'[12:53] <oy> ah, good to know\n'
p2329
aS'[12:55] <Riddell> oy: where is the GUI in kwin for this?\n'
p2330
aS'[12:55]  * oy works on the fixes and pushes a new tar ball\n'
p2331
aS'[12:56] <apachelogger> yes, upload to incoming, then file a sysamind request to move it to ftpmaster containing target path and the sha1 of the tarball\n'
p2332
aS'[12:58] <oy> Riddell, http://userbase.kde.org/Color_Management/en\n'
p2333
aS'[12:59] <oy> the enabling of colour correction happens inside KWin effect dialog, it is for the first release experimental\n'
p2334
aS"[13:05] <Riddell> oy: groovy thanks for answering my questions, I'll look into getting it packaged and in the archive\n"
p2335
aS'[13:07] <oy> Riddell, thanks, meanwhile I will work on a kolor-manager-1.0.1 release and proper upload\n'

aS'[21:56] <Mamarok> *sigh* and you really expect me to ask the average user to do that?\n'
p2530
aS'[21:57] <Mamarok> looks complicated even to me\n'
p2531
aS'[21:57] <Mamarok> apparently just rebuilding taglib from source with debug enabled seems much easier than that\n'
p2532
aS'[21:59] <Mamarok> and then it has to be removed again?\n'
p2533
aS'[21:59] <Mamarok> not user friendly at all, and the bug reports we get for taglib are from plain users\n'
p2534
aS'[21:59] <Mamarok> too complicated\n'

p2541
aS'[22:02] <mikhas> so, find someone to fix taglib packaging to create a *--dbg package?\n'
p2542

p2543
aS'[22:03] <mikhas> yes\n'

Your private PPA (ppa:kubuntu-ninjas/ppa) is currently exempt from normal PPA expiry rules, so its entire 500GB history is preserved and using up quite a bit of space in LP.

p3369
aS"[10:18] <Riddell> allee: it's all the same linking chain so there's no difference\n"
p3370
aS"[10:18] <Riddell> it's fine to do that\n"
p3371
aS'[10:29]  * allee ponders\n'
p3372
aS"[10:32] <allee> Wouldn't this allow to wrap any GPL2 code with open source LGPL layer and than link to the LGPL wrapper.  As LGPL allows linking without forceing to open source it,  closed source code could make use of any GPL  code it likes\n"
p3373
aS'[10:36] <tsimpson> it could only make use of the wrapper, not the GPL code directly\n'
p3374
aS'[10:37] <tsimpson> like how Qt can use GPLd libs, but still be LGPL\n'
p3375
aS'[10:49] <Riddell> "GPL2 code with open source LGPL layer" the result would be GPL\n'
p3376
aS'[10:49] <Riddell> because GPL linked with LGPL makes GPL\n'

p3396

aS'[12:57] <apachelogger> i.e. the binary\n'

p3403
aS"[13:01] <apachelogger> allee: it's pretty much the thing why companies don't like GPL  ... if they were to include GPL code in a product and publish that they'd have created a GPL licensed binary thus required to also publish the GPL containing code of the binary artifact\n"
p3404
aS'[13:02] <apachelogger> (suffice to say there are ways to work around that... one of them being containing the GPL code in a *runtime loaded* *not necessary* plugin \n'

aS'[13:20] <apachelogger> so it makes no sense that peace- had the intel driver not installed\n'
p3438
aS'[13:20] <BluesKaj> apachelogger, np\n'
p3439
aS'[13:20] <apachelogger> as kubuntu-desktop should depend on xserver-xorg one way or another and that depends on all drivers and that depends on intel\n'
p3440
aS"[13:22] <yofel> lightdm recommends xserver-xorg, that's how it gets pulled in usually I think\n"

aS'[13:24] <apachelogger> BluesKaj: anywho, xorg configs are not necessary when autodetection works fine\n'

aS'[13:24] <apachelogger> such that it creates the config in-memory when loading the driver\n'
p3449
aS'[13:24] <apachelogger> in case that is what you meant ;)\n'
p3450
aS"[13:24] <apachelogger> yofel: as long as they don't break ABI :P\n"

aS'[13:25] <yofel> well, we can blame the Ubuntu-X folks for pushing new X right before beta then\n'
p3456
aS'[13:25] <yofel> ah good\n'
p3457
aS'[13:25] <yofel> oh, new tomahaw, wheee\n'
p3458
aS'[13:26] <apachelogger> yofel: yeah, just saying, I prefer not having broken X over having broken X so I usually use the free drivers until rc\n'

aS'[13:26] <Riddell> philwyett: next on the todo list is htat\n'

aS'[13:26] <apachelogger> tho now all my systems are intel again, so not needed anymore :D\n'
p3461
aS'[13:26] <apachelogger> intel ftw\n'
p3462
aS'[13:26] <apachelogger> also intel drver not so much :S\n'
p3463
aS"[13:27] <yofel> no comment on intel. As for nouveau the performance is similiar to intel and I can't use my DisplayPort with nouveau\n"

aS'[13:34] <apachelogger> but how would you know considering you cannot build with arm? :D :D\n'
p3469
aS'[13:48] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: whut?\n'
p3470
aS'[13:51] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: I just estimated from archive builds\n'
p3471
aS'[13:59] <apachelogger> but what if one wants to do that for a package that is not actually in archive\n'
p3472
aS'[13:59] <shadeslayer> then you check it on the arm farm\n'
p3473
aS'[13:59] <shadeslayer> that ScottK has\n'
p3474
aS'[14:00] <ScottK> Which would work faster if apachelogger would re-enable the ice creaming.\n'
p3475
aS'[14:02] <shadeslayer> well .. atleast have a super fast way of updating plasma active now\n'
p3476
aS'[14:02] <apachelogger> !\n'
p3477
aS'[14:02] <apachelogger> I looked into that\n'

aS"[14:24] <Riddell> but what's stopping it being uploaded to the archive?\n"
p3492
aS'[14:25] <shadeslayer> nothing apart from QA and updating rules\n'
p3493
aS'[14:25] <shadeslayer> I have no idea if it works\n'
p3494
aS"[14:25] <shadeslayer> because I haven't tested it at all\n"

aS'[14:25] <Riddell> well does it work on your laptop?\n'
p3496
aS"[14:25] <shadeslayer> didn't test, because I was working on other stuff after uploading it :(\n"
p3497
aS'[14:26] <Riddell> interesting way of development :)\n'
p3498

aS"[15:20] <apachelogger> it's the most elegant bash you'll ever see\n"

aS'[15:21] <apachelogger> it even has pointers!!#@!\n'

p3631
aS'[16:26] <Riddell> shadeslayer might have pointers for that\n'
p3632
aS'[16:26] <shadeslayer> ohai\n'
p3633
aS'[16:26] <shadeslayer> ok so\n'
p3634
aS'[16:26] <Riddell> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization is the easy one to follow\n'
p3635
aS"[16:28] <sbivol> Riddell: yes, it's a Debin tool, but heavily ubuntu-oriented. I just thought that the official Kubuntu images are also built with live-build...\n"
p3636
aS'[16:28] <shadeslayer> they are\n'
p3637
aS'[16:28] <shadeslayer> kind of\n'
p3638
aS'[16:28] <sbivol> s/Debin/Debian\n'
p3639
aS'[16:29] <shadeslayer> the squashfs is built by live-build then handed over to some tool that creates the actual CD\n'
p3640
aS'[16:29] <shadeslayer> but live-build will suffice \n'
p3641
aS'[16:29] <shadeslayer> sbivol: I recommend installing ubuntu-defaults-builder\n'
p3642
aS'[16:30] <sbivol> shadeslayer: is there a recipe for building an official Kubuntu image with live-build? at least to the squashfs stage\n'
p3643
aS'[16:30] <shadeslayer> nope, but I have a script to create Netrunner Images\n'
p3644
aS'[16:30] <shadeslayer> sbivol: see https://github.com/netrunner/live-build\n'
p3645
aS'[16:30] <shadeslayer> more specifically netrunner-image-builder.sh\n'
p3646
aS"[16:31] <shadeslayer> but that's heavily customized\n"

p3648
aS'[16:34] <sbivol> shadeslayer: thank you very much, netrunner-image-builder.sh is priceless\n'
p3649
aS'[16:34] <shadeslayer> np :)\n'
p3650
aS'[16:35] <shadeslayer> sbivol: if you get stuck, read the live-build manual :P\n'
p3651
aS'[16:35] <sbivol> shadeslayer: I did, but it only says \xe2\x80\x9eAdd the keys to config/archive\xe2\x80\x9d, with no mention of the key format or troubleshooting \n'
p3652
aS'[16:36] <shadeslayer> ah\n'
p3653
aS'[16:36] <shadeslayer> haha\n'
p3654
aS"[16:36] <sbivol> It's a key error, but I have no clue what exactly is wrong with the key, since I extracted it from the medibuntu-keyring package\n"
p3655
aS'[16:37] <shadeslayer> https://github.com/netrunner/live-build/blob/master/archives/medibuntu.key.chroot :P\n'
p3656
aS'[16:37] <shadeslayer> it was fun when I started out because the version of live-build in the archive was pretty old\n'
p3657
aS'[16:38] <shadeslayer> and then I asked cjwatson to updated lb and all hell broke loose because they changed the format\n'
p3658
aS'[16:38] <sbivol> yep, I have the exact same key\n'
p3659
aS'[16:38] <shadeslayer> so I had to redo everything\n'
p3660
aS'[16:39] <sbivol> shadeslayer: I see that the official documentation is up-to-date, but all the tutorials on the internet are not suitable for the current live-build\n'
p3661
aS'[16:39] <shadeslayer> yeah, the documentation is actually too new\n'
p3662
aS"[16:39] <sbivol> oh, and I'm trying to build raring :)\n"
p3663
aS"[16:40] <shadeslayer> sbivol: oh oh, if you're trying to build raring on anything but a precise machine it won't work\n"
p3664
aS'[16:40] <shadeslayer> so I recommend building in a raring chroot\n'
p3665
aS"[16:40] <sbivol> I'm doing raring on raring\n"
p3666
aS'[16:40] <shadeslayer> cool :)\n'
p3667
aS'[16:41] <shadeslayer> and the documentation on live.debian.net is for a different lb version than the one we have in Ubuntu\n'
p3668
aS'[16:41] <shadeslayer> and the ubuntu one has some customizations\n'
p3669
aS"[16:42] <shadeslayer> so if you find that the documentation has some feature while lb on your system doesn't really have, it's not a bug :P\n"
p3670
aS"[16:43] <sbivol> shadeslayer: I'll keep that in mind\n"

aS'[16:53] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: cool\n'

aS"[18:29] <yofel> well, this seems like a change trageted at devs from what I understand. I don't see a reason to use it for the distro packages\n"

aS'[18:31] <Riddell> well it works fine and puts them in the right place except it hardcodes "site-packages"\n'
p4001
aS'[18:32] <Riddell> but I guess settings INSTALL_PYTHON_FILES_IN_PYTHON_PREFIX by default is much the same as reverting to the old version\n'

p4452
aS'[13:13] <wakeup> Should I continue the translation with oneiric (https://translations.launchpad.net/kubuntu-docs/oneiric/+lang/tr) or did I waste my time by not translating Raring files (https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+lang/tr/+index?batch=75&memo=150&start=150)?

p4681
aS"[17:50] <gspr> Riddell: I'd like to do a little bit for Kubuntu (although the work has been done upstream), but I don't really know how to proceed.\n"
p4682
aS"[17:50] <gspr> How do I go about suggesting upstream's patch for inclusion into (k)ubuntu?\n"
p4683
aS"[17:50] <gspr> It's a simple patch, and the problem is well-understood (and very annoying)\n"
p4684
aS"[17:51] <Riddell> gspr: well you've just done the suggesting :)\n"
p4685
aS'[17:51] <Riddell> but the packaging is the next step\n'
p4686
aS'[17:51] <Riddell> also checking with upstream\n'
p4687
aS'[17:52] <gspr> OK\n'
p4688
aS'[17:52] <Riddell> gspr: know anything about packaging?\n'
p4689
aS'[17:52] <gspr> Riddell: Yes, I package stuff for my PPA every now and then, but I seldom get to hear criticism - meaning I probably do a lot of things wrong :)\n'
p4690
aS"[17:53] <Riddell> gspr: actually first step is to check for bugs in launchpad or report one if it doesn't exist\n"
p4691
aS"[17:53] <gspr> Riddell: I've got a patched version of kde-workspace in my PPA, which simply adds the upstream patch to debian/patches and appends its name to debian/patches/series. That builds without warnings (as far as I can see) and solves the problem (as far as three-four days of testing suggests)\n"
p4692
aS"[17:54] <Riddell> yeah that's about all that's needed for a technical solution\n"
p4693
aS'[17:54] <Riddell> but this is a stable release update so needs some beurocracy\n'
p4694
aS'[17:54] <Riddell> so needs a bug in launchpad\n'
p4695
aS'[17:55] <gspr> Riddell: Right, that makes sense. Upstream has the bug as relating to "component kwin", while I patched kde-workspace in (k)ubunut\'s case. So I just report a bug against kde-workspace on launchpad then?\n'
p4696
aS'[17:56] <gspr> Riddell: Also, for the bug report, should I describe/summarize the problem and upstream analysis, or is linking sufficient? In this case, the upstream discussion is short and clear.\n'
p4697
aS'[17:56] <Riddell> yes, kwin is part of kde-workspace\n'
p4698
aS'[17:56] <gspr> ah, right, ok\n'
p4699
aS'[17:56] <Riddell> summarise it yes, just a sentence needed\n'
p4700
aS"[17:56] <gspr> OK. I'll check if it's already reported, and report it otherwise.\n"

aS"[17:56] <Riddell> and if you can work out how to link the bug to the upstream bug that's bonus points\n"

p4727
aS'[21:04] <cyphermox> not bad\n'
p4728
aS'[21:05] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: I had a work item to speak to you about the KDE networkmanagement app VPN plugins \n'
p4729
aS'[21:05] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: remember what it might be about? :)\n'
p4730
aS'[21:06] <shadeslayer> ah yes :)\n'
p4731
aS'[21:07] <shadeslayer> it was that while the VPN plugins are listed, they might/might not be installed\n'
p4732
aS'[21:07] <shadeslayer> so when a user clicks on a plugin that is not installs, we launch the package manager and prod the user to install it\n'
p4733
aS'[21:07] <shadeslayer> kind of like what we do with gstreamer plugin search\n'
p4734
aS"[21:08] <shadeslayer> ( play an avi file -> can't find the gst plugin, search repo and prompt user to install it )\n"
p4735
aS'[21:18] <soee> screen block is broken in RC3 ?\n'
p4736
aS'[21:19] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: it was also decided that it would be better to have this in nm itself\n'
p4737
aS'[21:20] <cyphermox> ah\n'
p4738
aS"[21:20] <cyphermox> I'm not sure it's a matter of a list so much though\n"
p4739
aS'[21:20] <shadeslayer> matter of a list?\n'
p4740
aS'[21:20] <cyphermox> well\n'
p4741
aS'[21:21] <cyphermox> ideally you should be able to add a new VPN plugin without having to modify NM code\n'
p4742
aS'[21:21] <cyphermox> AFAIK it would go kind of like the gst plugin, the UI should handle it, and just have enough logic to know to search for any package starting with "network-manager-(vpn)" for instance.\n'
p4743
aS'[21:22] <shadeslayer> I see, well, the use case we got a couple of months back ( right before UDS ), was that someone was trying to use one of the VPN plugins via the KDE Frontend, but that plugin was not installed\n'
p4744
aS'[21:22] <cyphermox> right\n'
p4745
aS'[21:22] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: I think I proposed that initially\n'
p4746
aS'[21:22] <shadeslayer> but then someone said that it makes more sense to do it in NM itself\n'
p4747
aS'[21:23] <cyphermox> I guess I could have said that\n'
p4748
aS"[21:23] <cyphermox> it's just that the choice of package manager then makes more sense in the UI I guess\n"
p4749
aS"[21:23] <shadeslayer> I don't remember :D\n"
p4750
aS'[21:23] <cyphermox> so no point in changing NM just to add a regex or whatever to list the names of packages for NM :D\n'
p4751
aS'[21:24] <shadeslayer> iirc it was you who said that you could make a packagekit interface\n'
p4752
aS'[21:24] <shadeslayer> s/make a/use the/\n'
p4753
aS'[21:24] <kubotu> shadeslayer meant: "iirc it was you who said that you could use the packagekit interface"\n'
p4754
aS'[21:24] <cyphermox> by that I mean that you might be using KPackageKit or whatever, where on Gnome it would be something else\n'
p4755
aS'[21:24] <cyphermox> yeah\n'
p4756
aS'[21:25] <cyphermox> still it would really have to all be done in the UI\n'
p4757
aS'[21:25] <cyphermox> I think\n'
p4758
aS"[21:25] <cyphermox> but fair enough -- at least now I know that it's as I thought, about how to make it easier to install the VPN plugins\n"
p4759
aS'[21:25] <shadeslayer> okay :)\n'
p4760
aS'[21:26] <shadeslayer> how about I write an email to the kde nm developer so that we can discuss this?\n'

aS'[00:21] <yofel> nope\n'
p4934
aS'[00:22] <allee> KDAP dudes did pkging for debian.  So there should be something already ...\n'

aS'[00:22] <phoenix_firebrd> whats the syntax for uupdate\n'
p4936
aS'[00:22] <yofel> we have kolab 0.2.1, can be updated to 0.4.1\n'

aS'[00:24] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: if you\'ve unpackaged the old package and ran uscan, then "uupdate ../libkolab_0.4.1.orig.tar.gz"\n'
p4940
aS'[00:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so initially i have to git clone right?\n'
p4941
aS"[00:25] <yofel> no, you don't need git at all\n"
p4942
aS'[00:26] <yofel> we package tarballs if available, not git snapshots. (even if for kolab the tarball is a snapshot of the git tag)\n'

p4944
aS'[00:26] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: uscan does that for you\n'
p4945
aS'[00:26] <yofel> using the watch file in the package\n'

p5001
aS'[00:58] <yofel> ok, I need to be off to bed, a few hints:\n'
p5002
aS"[00:58] <yofel> if you don't have a pbuilder chroot yet, look at pbuilder-dist which should be easy to understand\n"
p5003
aS"[00:58] <yofel> if you can't fix the tests (I'm too tried to make sense of the errors right now) disabel them by putting 'override_dh_auto_test:' a the end of debian/rules\n"
p5004
aS"[00:58] <yofel> if you don't know what a symbol diff (which you'll see after fixing the install file), look at http://pkg-kde.alioth.debian.org/symbolfiles.html (and no, you don't need to immediately understand that)\n"
p5005
aS'[00:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: no, just fix your name in debian/changelog\n'
p5006
aS'[00:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok good night, see you later\n'
p5007
aS'[00:59] <yofel> feel free to throw questions at the channel anyway, someone might answer while you stick around\n'
p5008
aS'[01:00] <yofel> good night\n'
p5009
aS'[02:25] <EagleScreen> why apturl-kde depends on software-properties-kde? does it really need it?\n'

p5011
aS'[06:39] <shadeslayer> wow\n'

aS'[12:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i can test, rc3 for which version?\n'
p5092
aS'[12:42] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: precise + 4.9.98 from beta ppa\n'
p5093
aS'[12:42] <yofel> I just asked the reporter if he really did restart his session after the upgrade\n'
p5094
aS'[12:42] <yofel> as that symbol error looks fishy\n'
p5095
aS'[12:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: Its working in 12.10\n'
p5096
aS'[12:43] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: how far did you get with kolab yesterday?\n'
p5097
aS'[12:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i dont have 12.04\n'
p5098
aS'[12:43] <yofel> no problem\n'
p5099
aS'[12:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its in launchpad 4 min to build for i386\n'
p5100
aS"[12:44] <yofel> I tried to reproduce it in a VM, but either it's not broken or I'm missing something\n"
p5101
aS'[12:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: build successful with pbuilder, some tests fail\n'
p5102
aS'[12:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: for the kate thing, there was some problem with qt that make many qt apps crah\n'
p5103
aS'[12:45] <phoenix_firebrd> *crash\n'
p5104
aS"[12:46] <yofel> hm, that doesn't look like a qt error though\n"
p5105
aS'[12:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in pbuilder kdeinit needs klauncher, so do i have to install the minimum kde packages?\n'
p5106
aS'[12:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats for testing\n'
p5107
aS'[12:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: for testing what?\n'
p5108
aS'[12:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the tests fail because kdeinit cant find klauncher binary\n'
p5109
aS'[12:50] <yofel> oh, good catch\n'
p5110
aS'[12:51] <yofel> I guess adding a build-dep for kdelibs5-plugins for the tests is acceptable\n'
p5111
aS'[12:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so after the tests should i have to remove the build-dep?\n'
p5112
aS'[12:53] <yofel> no, just add it to the Build-Depends in the control file\n'
p5113

p5121
aS'[12:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its in universe , it is needed\n'
p5122
aS'[12:56] <yofel> no, wait, we need to clear something up here\n'
p5123
aS'[12:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: how can i add universe to the ppa?\n'
p5124
aS'[12:57] <yofel> that you can do from the main ppa page -> Edit Dependencies\n'
p5125
aS"[12:57] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: now back to the lib: it's needed by what?\n"
p5126
aS"[12:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: and it's libkcalcore4 not libkcalccore4\n"
p5127
aS'[12:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: during build it failed at a point and i went it to the source and found it needs this\n'
p5128

p5129
aS'[12:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: checking\n'
p5130
aS'[13:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: yes its a typo\n'
p5131
aS"[13:00] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: and another thing: when you upload a package to a ppa, at least append ~ppa1 to the version, as you now won't be able to properly put an updated package into the PPA that can later be  updated to the archive package\n"
p5132
aS'[13:01] <yofel> note that ~ lowers the version\n'
p5133
aS'[13:01] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, i usually put -\n'

aS"[13:01] <yofel> - is higher, so that won't help either\n"
p5135
aS'[13:02]  * yofel tries to build without libkcalcore4 and libkabc\n'
p5136
aS'[13:02] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p5137
aS'[13:04] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version on how the package version is calculated\n'
p5138
aS'[13:05] <phoenix_firebrd> this is heaven\n'

aS'[13:10] <yofel> builds without those libs, but tests still fail\n'
p5140
aS'[13:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: for raring right?\n'
p5141
aS'[13:11]  * yofel wonders if this is the problem:\n'

p5143
aS'[13:11] <yofel> raring, yes\n'
p5144
aS'[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ktimezoned fails because of dbus not available\n'
p5145
aS'[13:12] <yofel> oh, right, now I saw that error too\n'
p5146
aS'[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: need dbus and dbus-x11\n'
p5147
aS'[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what error?\n'
p5148
aS'[13:12] <yofel> already installed\n'
p5149
aS'[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in that case kdelibs-plugin?\n'
p5150
aS'[13:13] <yofel> klauncher(21427) kdemain: No DBUS session-bus found. Check if you have started the DBUS server. \n'
p5151
aS'[13:13] <phoenix_firebrd> thats it\n'
p5152
aS'[13:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: does pbuilder store every build log and if so where?\n'
p5153
aS'[13:14] <yofel> did you use pbuilder-dist? I think that stores a .build file somewhere near the source or the build result\n'
p5154
aS'[13:14] <yofel> only the last build though\n'
p5155
aS'[13:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i used pbuilder\n'
p5156
aS'[13:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am confused\n'
p5157
aS'[13:18] <yofel> not sure where that puts it, I have this in my .pbuilderrc:\n'
p5158
aS'[13:18] <yofel> PKGNAME_LOGFILE_EXTENTION="_$(dpkg --print-architecture).build"\n'
p5159
aS'[13:18] <yofel> PKGNAME_LOGFILE=yes\n'
p5160
aS'[13:18] <yofel> which puts a logfile in the result folder\n'
p5161
aS'[13:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can using pbuilder-dist be different from pbuilder in building process? I am wondering how it failed for me\n'
p5162
aS'[13:21] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: do you have universe enabled in pbuilder?\n'
p5163
aS'[13:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, i put that in the pbuilderrc file\n'
p5164
aS"[13:21] <yofel> hum, can't say it then without a buildlog\n"
p5165
aS'[13:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what is the universe repository string\n'
p5166
aS'[13:23] <yofel> my sources list has:\n'
p5167
aS'[13:23] <yofel> deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring main restricted universe multiverse\n'
p5168
aS'[13:27] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no the string which i should be adding in the launchpad\n'
p5169
aS'[13:27] <yofel> why launchpad?\n'
p5170
aS'[13:27] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: testing\n'
p5171
aS"[13:28] <yofel> we're not at a point where the package will even build\n"

aS'[13:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no i wont build\n'

aS'[13:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: just to know\n'
p5174
aS'[13:28] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: mathieu-tl AT ubuntu ?\n'
p5175
aS'[13:28] <yofel> the ppa already has universe enabled\n'
p5176
aS'[13:29] <yofel> you see that in the buildlog\n'
p5177
aS'[13:29] <yofel> Get:11 http://ftpmaster.internal raring/universe i386 Packages [5407 kB]\n'
p5178
aS'[13:29] <shadeslayer> apparently yes\n'
p5179
aS'[13:29] <yofel> shadeslayer: do you know how to use dbus in package tests?\n'
p5180
aS'[13:30] <shadeslayer> yofel: I need more info, the kind that KDE ships with ?\n'
p5181
aS'[13:30] <shadeslayer> the ones you can start with make check/test\n'
p5182
aS'[13:30] <shadeslayer> or autopkg tests and what not\n'
p5183
aS'[13:30] <yofel> the ones that dh_auto_test will run\n'
p5184
aS'[13:31] <shadeslayer> right, make test/check\n'
p5185
aS'[13:31] <yofel> right\n'
p5186
aS'[13:32] <shadeslayer> ideally those tests should use dbus-launch?\n'
p5187
aS"[13:32] <shadeslayer> or you could override dh_auto_test and manually start a session if the test doesn't do it already?\n"
p5188
aS"[13:34] <yofel> that's what I tried, let me try again to get a clean log\n"
p5189
aS'[13:39] <yofel> shadeslayer: http://paste.kde.org/654422/\n'
p5190
aS'[13:40] <shadeslayer> and are you sure that dbus was launched?\n'
p5191
aS'[13:40] <shadeslayer> maybe dbus needs other stuff setup first or sth\n'
p5192
aS'[13:40] <yofel> well, I probably did it the wrong way\n'
p5193
aS"[13:40] <yofel> now I did 'dbus-launch dh_auto_test' and it hung up\n"
p5194

p5209
aS'[13:47] <shadeslayer> never tried running kded4 without dbus :P\n'
p5210
aS'[13:50] <yofel> shadeslayer: running dbus-launch is fine, but I fail at getting DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS and DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID into the environment after that\n'
p5211
aS'[13:51] <shadeslayer> oh, how do you do dbus-launch? just dbus-launch?\n'
p5212
aS'[13:51] <shadeslayer> can you try eval `dbus-launch`\n'
p5213
aS'[13:51] <yofel>         eval `dbus-launch`\n'

p5223
aS'[14:01] <shadeslayer> yofel: try kdeini4 kded4\n'
p5224
aS'[14:01] <yofel> great, putting the stuff into a subscript worked... but now:\n'

p5229
aS'[14:02] <yofel> why do people assume that kde is running during a build...\n'
p5230
aS'[14:03] <agateau> hey, dummy question: are kde packages built with -DQT_NO_DEBUG ?\n'
p5231
aS'[14:05] <yofel> agateau: I think yes\n'
p5232
aS'[14:06] <agateau> yofel: ok, thanks. Do you know if other distros do the same?\n'

p5242
aS'[14:10] <shadeslayer> ah sure\n'
p5243
aS'[14:10] <shadeslayer> whatcha guys packaging?\n'
p5244
aS'[14:11] <yofel> libkolab\n'
p5245
aS'[14:12] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: put this in your debian/rules: http://paste.kde.org/654464/ - that will make the test not hold everything up\n'
p5246
aS'[14:12] <shadeslayer> I see\n'
p5247
aS'[14:12]  * shadeslayer would have gone for a .PHONY target there\n'
p5248
aS'[14:13] <yofel> why?\n'
p5249
aS'[14:14] <shadeslayer> just to be safer?\n'
p5250
aS"[14:14] <shadeslayer> though that's fine as well :)\n"
p5251
aS'[14:14] <yofel> well, I just wanted to get the error out of the way, not the tests themselves\n'
p5252
aS'[14:14] <shadeslayer> ah\n'
p5253
aS'[14:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: next?\n'
p5254
aS"[14:16] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: try to build it again, it'll end at missing files this time\n"
p5255
aS"[14:16]  * shadeslayer notes that we should put up a wiki page explaining what can be shipped and what's blacklisted\n"
p5256
aS'[14:17] <yofel> blacklisted as in?\n'
p5257
aS'[14:17] <shadeslayer> well\n'
p5258
aS'[14:17] <shadeslayer> blacklisted from the seeds\n'
p5259
aS'[14:17] <shadeslayer> libav for eg\n'
p5260
aS'[14:17] <yofel> ah, look at the seeds?\n'
p5261
aS'[14:17] <shadeslayer> sure, but no user looks at the seeds \n'
p5262
aS'[14:17] <yofel> hum, true\n'
p5263
aS'[14:18] <shadeslayer> they\'re like "The thing thats used to grow plants?"\n'
p5264
aS'[14:18] <EagleScreen> why apturl-kde depends on software-properties-kde, doues it really need it? is to enable repositories on the fly?\n'
p5265
aS'[14:18] <shadeslayer> hmm \n'
p5266
aS'[14:19] <shadeslayer> probably uses some python function?\n'
p5267
aS"[14:21] <yofel> doEnableSection() runs software-properties-kde so that's ok\n"
p5268
aS"[14:21] <yofel> EagleScreen: that's the case it seems\n"
p5269
aS'[14:21] <EagleScreen> I see, thanks\n'
p5270
aS'[14:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: you and shadeslayer were discussing about running processes before in testing process, how to do that?\n'
p5271
aS'[14:24] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: things like dbus-launch and kded4?\n'
p5272
aS"[14:24] <EagleScreen> and that kind of functions shouldn't be go to software-properties-common?\n"
p5273
aS'[14:24] <shadeslayer> just add them to the required target\n'
p5274
aS'[14:24] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya\n'
p5275
aS'[14:24] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: for example dolphin\n'
p5276
aS'[14:24] <Riddell> shadeslayer: ship: * !libavcodec*\n'
p5277
aS'[14:24] <Riddell> ship: * !phonon-backend-null\n'
p5278
aS'[14:25] <Riddell> ! means blacklist\n'
p5279
aS"[14:25] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about means blacklist\n"
p5280
aS'[14:25] <shadeslayer> Riddell: that too\n'
p5281
aS'[14:25] <yofel> EagleScreen: not as long as it does this: http://paste.kde.org/654482\n'
p5282
aS'[14:27] <EagleScreen> wow\n'
p5283
aS'[14:29] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: rules is a Makefile, there you can define a target which you can then add a list of command to. So in dh7 packaging we would add an override target and just run the commands we want to add before the overridden command\n'
p5284
aS'[14:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok. installing fails. http://paste.kde.org/654488/\n'
p5285
aS"[14:31] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: right, as those are header files, you'll have to add them to libkolab-dev.install\n"
p5286
aS'[14:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what is this file  libkolab-dev.install ?\n'
p5287
aS'[14:32] <shadeslayer> afiestas: does webaccounts have a release?\n'
p5288
aS'[14:32] <yofel> a .install files tells debhelper what files will end up in a package\n'
p5289
aS'[14:32] <afiestas> shadeslayer: ?\n'
p5290
aS'[14:32] <shadeslayer> afiestas: a versioned release\n'
p5291
aS'[14:32] <yofel> development .so links and header files go into a -dev package by convention\n'
p5292
aS"[14:33] <afiestas> don't think so\n"
p5293
aS'[14:33] <shadeslayer> like 0.1 or sth\n'
p5294
aS'[14:33] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so libkolab-dev.install is the list of files that will be put into libkolab-dev\n'
p5295
aS'[14:33] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what about be the location of the  libkolab-dev.install?\n'
p5296
aS'[14:33] <yofel> inside the debian/ folder as always\n'
p5297
aS"[14:33] <yofel> it's already there, you just need to add the 3 files to it\n"
p5298
aS'[14:34] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so the output of debuild would be two packages?\n'
p5299
aS"[14:34] <yofel> yes, debian/control has 2 Package: definitions, i.e. you'll get 2 packages\n"
p5300
aS'[14:35] <yofel> you can add an install file for every package. (Actually once you have more than one package you need install files)\n'
p5301
aS'[14:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok i have added the 3 lines to the install files,should i build ?\n'
p5302
aS'[14:36] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: yep, but for the next step make sure that pbuilder saves the buildlog somewhere\n'
p5303
aS'[14:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sorry i started the build process without routing to a file, i will do it the next time\n'

aS'[14:40] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: do you have any .build files in /var/cache/pbuilder/result/ ?\n'
p5306
aS'[14:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: on call\n'
p5307
aS'[14:40] <yofel> or wherever the build result gets put for you\n'

p5314
aS'[14:45] <EagleScreen> software-properties-kde seems to be outdated respect software-properties-gtk, do you plan update it ? do you plan use jockey forever to enable restricted drivers? \n'
p5315
aS'[14:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this is my pbuilderrc http://paste.kde.org/654506/\n'
p5316
aS'[14:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: is content in rc file correct?\n'
p5317
aS'[14:47] <yofel> yes, just add the 2 lines I posted\n'
p5318
aS'[14:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: adding\n'
p5319
aS'[14:47] <phoenix_firebrd> done\n'
p5320
aS'[14:48] <shadeslayer> EagleScreen: re jockey, I might look into that next month\n'
p5321
aS'[14:48] <shadeslayer> since no one has bothered looking into it\n'
p5322
aS"[14:49] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: while we're at it, let's add one more thing that all of us use\n"
p5323
aS"[14:49] <yofel> first run 'bzr co lp:~kubuntu-packagers/pbuilder/pbuilder-hooks ~/.pbuilder-hooks'\n"
p5324
aS'[14:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i think build succeed. http://paste.kde.org/654518/ \n'
p5325
aS'[14:50] <yofel> and then add this to your pbuilderrc:\n'
p5326
aS'[14:50] <yofel> HOOKDIR="$HOME/.pbuilder-hooks"\n'
p5327
aS"[14:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: yep, and now we get to something that's specific to library packaging: symbol files\n"
p5328
aS'[14:51] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: do you know what library symbols are?\n'
p5329
aS'[14:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i was once , when cracking windows exes and dlls\n'
p5330
aS'[14:52] <yofel> ah ok, linux ofc has them too, and we track the ABI of a library by keeping a list of all provided symbols in the package\n'
p5331
aS"[14:53] <yofel> that's what the libkolab0.symbols file in the package is for\n"
p5332
aS"[14:53] <yofel> now you'll see that dpkg-gensymbols posted a diff in the buildlog\n"
p5333
aS'[14:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: checking\n'
p5334
aS'[14:53] <yofel> so the new version adds a lot of symbols (and removes 2 optional ones - marked as #MISSING#)\n'
p5335
aS'[14:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i can see that in the log\n'
p5336
aS'[14:55] <yofel> good, as c++ is a bit weird with symbols, we have a helper called pkgkde-symbolshelper that helps to manage the symbols\n'
p5337
aS'[14:55] <yofel> you can read more on that on http://pkg-kde.alioth.debian.org/symbolfiles.html\n'
p5338
aS"[14:55] <yofel> for now I'll explain on how to update the file\n"
p5339
aS"[14:56] <yofel> for that you'll need to be inside the package, i.e. in libkolab-0.4.1\n"
p5340
aS"[14:56] <yofel> next you'll need a file with the symbol diff, the buildlog works fine for that\n"
p5341
aS'[14:56] <yofel> now you need to update the symbols for the new version, which you can do with:\n'
p5342
aS'[14:57] <yofel> pkgkde-symbolshelper batchpatch -v 0.4.1 path_to_buildlog\n'
p5343
aS'[14:57] <yofel> just put the actual buildlog a the end instead\n'
p5344
aS'[14:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: this should look like this in the end: http://paste.kde.org/654524\n'
p5345
aS'[14:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the buildlog should be full or partial is satisfied?\n'
p5346
aS'[14:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: partial is fine as long as you have the complete symbol diff\n'
p5347
aS'[14:59] <yofel> as the script will look for the output of dpkg-gensymbols\n'
p5348
aS'[14:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: shall i try with this http://paste.kde.org/654518/?\n'
p5349
aS'[14:59] <yofel> yeah, should work\n'
p5350
aS'[15:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/654530/\n'
p5351
aS'[15:03] <yofel> yeah, looks right\n'
p5352
aS'[15:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what about the missing ones\n'
p5353
aS'[15:04] <yofel> now just to clean it up: open the symbols file in an editor, look for the MISSING ones and remove the commented lines\n'
p5354
aS"[15:04] <yofel> they're optional so don't worry about them\n"
p5355
aS'[15:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this is the symbol file after removing the commented lines http://paste.kde.org/654536/\n'
p5356
aS'[15:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok?\n'
p5357
aS'[15:08] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have done the launchpad pbuilder hook\n'
p5358
aS'[15:08] <yofel> the symbolsfile looks ok from what I see. Try building again, this time there should be no diff\n'
p5359
aS'[15:09] <yofel> good, those are some pbuilder enhancements that we use to make life easier\n'
p5360
aS'[15:09] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what does that do?\n'
p5361
aS"[15:10] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: it's just a set of scripts, feel free to read them. The pbuilder manpage explains when what is called\n"
p5362
aS'[15:10] <yofel> (most important ones are auto-installing-updates and running list-missing at the end)\n'
p5363
aS'[15:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p5364
aS'[15:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: going to build again\n'
p5365
aS'[15:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what about the tests? is it mandate for them to succeed to build a package?\n'
p5366
aS"[15:14] <yofel> it's mostly a mandate in main, so I think we could live without them. But they should work really. Problem now is that it seems you need to set up a working kde session during the build for them to work :/\n"
p5367
aS'[15:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i installed dbus and dbus-x11 after login and with save after login option\n'
p5368
aS"[15:15] <yofel> that won't help for the archive\n"
p5369
aS'[15:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya\n'
p5370
aS'[15:16] <yofel> there you have to set everything up during the build\n'
p5371
aS"[15:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: why didn't apt-cache search klaunch return kdelibs5-plugin , instead return some xfce package?\n"
p5372
aS'[15:17] <phoenix_firebrd> *klauncher\n'
p5373
aS'[15:17] <yofel> klauncher has no own package, use dpkg -S or apt-file search\n'
p5374
aS'[15:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: right\n'
p5375
aS'[15:21] <yofel> geh, running make test on a local libkolab build opens kompare several times\n'
p5376
aS"[15:21] <yofel> that's not doable during a package build\n"
p5377
aS'[15:21] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd, shadeslayer: forget the tests -.-\n'
p5378
aS'[15:21] <shadeslayer> oh?\n'
p5379
aS'[15:22] <shadeslayer> why not?\n'
p5380
aS'[15:22] <phoenix_firebrd> ?\n'
p5381
aS'[15:22] <yofel> see 2 lines above\n'
p5382
aS'[15:22] <shadeslayer> xvfb?\n'
p5383
aS'[15:22] <yofel> and how do you close kompare in xvfb?\n'
p5384
aS"[15:22] <shadeslayer> or whatever it's called\n"
p5385
aS"[15:22] <shadeslayer> don't?\n"
p5386
aS"[15:22] <yofel> the tests don't continue while it's open?\n"
p5387
aS'[15:22] <shadeslayer> ah\n'
p5388
aS'[15:22]  * shadeslayer thinks\n'
p5389
aS"[15:23] <shadeslayer> yofel: if possible, can you check if there's a dbus interface that we can call as soon as kompare is seen on the screen?\n"
p5390
aS'[15:23] <shadeslayer> so you could tell it to quit\n'
p5391
aS'[15:23] <shadeslayer> over dbus\n'
p5392
aS'[15:23] <phoenix_firebrd> why is it opening\n'
p5393
aS"[15:25] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: because it's a test :)\n"
p5394
aS'[15:25] <shadeslayer> yofel: and complaint loudly to kolab people :P\n'
p5395
aS'[15:25] <yofel> qdbus org.kde.kompare-24620 /kompare/FirstKompareShell org.qtproject.Qt.QWidget.close\n'
p5396
aS'[15:25] <yofel> works, but as you see it has the PID in the interface URL\n'
p5397
aS'[15:25] <shadeslayer> simple\n'
p5398
aS'[15:26] <shadeslayer> qdbus `qdbus|grep kompare 0 /kompare/FirstKompareShell org.qtproject.Qt.QWidget.close` \n'
p5399
aS'[15:26] <shadeslayer> erm\n'
p5400
aS"[15:26] <yofel> ok, I'll leave it to you to figure it out :P\n"
p5401
aS'[15:26] <shadeslayer> qdbus `qdbus|grep kompare` /kompare/FirstKompareShell org.qtproject.Qt.QWidget.close` \n'
p5402
aS'[15:26] <shadeslayer> haha :P\n'
p5403
aS'[15:26] <shadeslayer> just give me the packaging :P\n'
p5404
aS"[15:26] <shadeslayer> when you're done\n"
p5405
aS'[15:26] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: how did the build go?\n'
p5406
aS'[15:26] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: fun, upstream will refuse qapt/packagekit patches\n'
p5407
aS'[15:27] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its running\n'
p5408
aS'[15:27] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I just talked to Lamarque and he said that he will not allow packages that add a feature that installs VPN packages on the fly when clicking "Setup VPN" or sth\n'
p5409
aS"[15:28] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: they won't, it can just be a compile-time switch, and show a proper error message when there is no way to invoke qapt or whatever, this is implementation detail that shouldn't be considered too much\n"
p5410
aS"[15:28] <cyphermox> instead, I'd just write a patch and propose it\n"
p5411
aS'[15:28] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: I mentioned that\n'
p5412
aS'[15:28] <shadeslayer> see the latest switch, you can try and convince him if you want :P\n'
p5413
aS'[15:28] <shadeslayer> erm\n'
p5414
aS'[15:28] <shadeslayer> s/switch/email/\n'
p5415
aS'[15:28] <kubotu> shadeslayer: You did something wrong... Try s/you/me/ or tell me "help sed"\n'
p5416
aS'[15:28] <Riddell> shadeslayer: why not?\n'
p5417
aS'[15:28] <shadeslayer> Riddell: "You can patch Plasma NM when building packages for (K)Ubuntu. I am just saying that I will not patch Plasma NN to do half work, if it does not work for everybody then this change should stay in (K)Ubuntu only."\n'
p5418
aS'[15:29] <shadeslayer> from email archives\n'
p5419
aS'[15:29] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: and by upstream I meant KDE upstream\n'
p5420
aS"[15:29] <Riddell> ok so we can add the feature but he won't take it upstream\n"
p5421
aS'[15:29] <shadeslayer> yes\n'
p5422
aS'[15:30] <Riddell> shadeslayer: remind me again why we need this?\n'
p5423
aS'[15:30] <shadeslayer> Riddell: plasma-widget-nm statically compiles a list of VPN stuff in the UI\n'
p5424
aS"[15:30] <shadeslayer> and that stuff won't actually work until that nm plugin is installed\n"
p5425
aS"[15:31] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: I think the approach by email was wrong, I'll respond\n"
p5426
aS'[15:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: full log http://paste.kde.org/654566/\n'
p5427
aS'[15:31] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: I see\n'
p5428
aS'[15:31] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: feel free to\n'
p5429
aS'[15:32] <shadeslayer> Riddell: go to the VPN tab in network manager plasmoid\n'
p5430
aS"[15:33] <shadeslayer> so if you add PPTP for eg, it won't work till you have network-manager-pptp install\n"
p5431
aS'[15:33] <shadeslayer> *installed\n'
p5432
aS"[15:33] <Riddell> shadeslayer: but why can't we just have them all installed by default?\n"
p5433
aS'[15:33] <shadeslayer> useless for most users?\n'
p5434
aS'[15:35] <Riddell> hmm   blacklist:network-manager-vpnc\n'
p5435
aS'[15:35] <Riddell> I wonder why that is\n'
p5436
aS"[15:35] <Riddell> I'm not sure that seed actually does anything now\n"
p5437
aS'[15:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I am getting an error "pkgkde-symbolshelper: error: no valid patches found"\n'
p5438
aS"[15:39] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: there is no patch - which means everything's ok now\n"
p5439
aS'[15:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thought so, nice\n'
p5440
aS'[15:40] <yofel> I just noticed that cmake complains about SWIG, but I have that installed here and it still complains\n'
p5441
aS'[15:40] <Riddell> yofel: has libkolab changed a lot?\n'
p5442
aS'[15:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: where did you see, in my log?\n'
p5443
aS'[15:40] <yofel> Riddell: a few new headers, new symbols, and a few new annoying tests\n'
p5444
aS"[15:41] <yofel> the tests are what we're talking about all day\n"
p5445
aS'[15:41] <yofel> oh, I had swig2.0, kolab wants swig\n'
p5446
aS'[15:41]  * yofel has no idea what swig is\n'
p5447
aS'[15:41] <yofel> Description-en: Generate scripting interfaces to C/C++ code\n'
p5448
aS'[15:44] <shadeslayer> wtf\n'
p5449
aS"[15:44] <shadeslayer> I can't resize a skype window\n"
p5450
aS'[15:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: should we add swig2.0 to build-deps ?\n'
p5451
aS'[15:45] <shadeslayer> the chat window specifically\n'
p5452
aS"[15:46] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: it's 'swig' that it wants - but I don't see any difference when adding it...\n"
p5453
aS'[15:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: loss of functionality witout that?\n'
p5454
aS"[15:47] <yofel> not sure, I guess it won't hurt to add it\n"
p5455
aS'[15:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p5456
aS'[15:47] <yofel> So add it and put the package somewhere where shadeslayer can fetch it\n'
p5457
aS"[15:48] <yofel> as I think we're done otherwise\n"
p5458
aS'[15:48] <shadeslayer> put it in a PPA?\n'
p5459
aS'[15:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  ok :)\n'
p5460
aS'[15:48] <yofel> ok, ppa...\n'
p5461
aS'[15:48] <phoenix_firebrd> mine?\n'
p5462
aS'[15:49] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: if you want to put it in the same ppa again, 2 things:\n'
p5463
aS'[15:49] <yofel> a) manually delete the package in there first\n'
p5464
aS'[15:49] <phoenix_firebrd> ~ppa1?\n'
p5465
aS'[15:49] <yofel> b) change the version to 0.4.1-0ubuntu1~ubuntu13.04~ppa1\n'
p5466
aS"[15:49] <yofel> that's the convention for raring\n"
p5467

aS'[16:03] <Riddell> yofel: grumpy! :)\n'
p5512
aS"[16:03] <EagleScreen> i'd only worry about it if it happens also in minor kde upgrades (4.9.4 -> 4.9.5)\n"
p5513
aS'[16:03] <Riddell> yofel: but that is a longstanding problem\n'
p5514
aS'[16:04] <yofel> Riddell: yeah, but usually it works - just this time they change the implementation and BOOM\n'
p5515
aS"[16:05] <yofel> EagleScreen: yeah, it's not really *that* great of an issue. But it looks REALLY unprofessional if a software update causes you do hard-cycle your system\n"
p5516
aS'[16:05] <yofel> which is what my dad would do in such a situation\n'
p5517
aS'[16:06] <EagleScreen> my dad and all my friend would do it too\n'
p5518
aS'[16:07] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: this is my ppa "murthy/test"\n'
p5519
aS'[16:07] <shadeslayer> cool\n'
p5520
aS'[16:07] <shadeslayer> oh\n'
p5521
aS'[16:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have uploaded the package waiting for the confirmation mail\n'
p5522

p5523
aS'[16:08]  * shadeslayer is guessing from the name\n'
p5524
aS'[16:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya\n'
p5525
aS'[16:08] <shadeslayer> your package is FTBFS in the PPA xD\n'
p5526
aS"[16:08] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: I'm in Gurgaon :)\n"
p5527
aS'[16:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i am from Tamilnadu\n'

p5531
aS'[16:10] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: yeah :)\n'
p5532
aS'[16:10] <shadeslayer> by profession only however\n'
p5533
aS'[16:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: cool\n'
p5534
aS"[16:11] <shadeslayer> I'm electronics and comm. engineer by education :P\n"
p5535
aS'[16:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: me too\n'
p5536
aS'[16:11] <shadeslayer> :)\n'
p5537
aS'[16:12] <Riddell> shadeslayer: really?  so this kubuntu stuff is just a side hobby for you?\n'
p5538
aS"[16:12] <shadeslayer> it's the other way around, the Electronics/GSM stuff was a hobby\n"
p5539
aS"[16:12] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: if you want, libkolabxml would be the next thing to update - it's less work too (I just checked ;P)\n"
p5540
aS'[16:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sure, can i do it tomorrow? \n'
p5541
aS"[16:13] <yofel> 1 patch to be dropped, a few new build-deps, and that's it\n"
p5542
aS'[16:13] <yofel> sure, just say if you need help or a review\n'
p5543
aS'[16:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sure, its bed time and i have to finish my dinner\n'
p5544
aS'[16:14] <yofel> hm, it seems some people can go to bed before sunrise... unlike shadeslayer :P\n'
p5545
aS'[16:14] <shadeslayer> hehe\n'
p5546
aS'[16:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have uploaded the files and its in the ppa, how can i delete the old one, there is no option to delete it\n'
p5547
aS'[16:15] <shadeslayer> I pulled off about 30 hours on Monday-Tuesday\n'
p5548
aS'[16:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: usually i do that\n'
p5549
aS'[16:15] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: https://launchpad.net/~murthy/+archive/test/+packages should have a delete button on the right side of the page\n'
p5550
aS'[16:15] <shadeslayer> at the end of 30 hours I wanted to just sleep\n'
p5551
aS"[16:15] <yofel> if you haven't deleted the package yet it'll probably get rejected\n"
p5552
aS"[16:16] <shadeslayer> but won't it get rejected even then?\n"
p5553
aS'[16:16] <shadeslayer> i.e. even after deleting them\n'
p5554
aS"[16:16] <yofel> as long as the tarball isn't different it should accept it I think\n"
p5555
aS'[16:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: done\n'
p5556
aS'[16:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its getting built for amd64\n'
p5557
aS'[16:17] <yofel> ah, the version is totally wrong, but I guess we can fix that\n'
p5558
aS"[16:18] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: pro tip, I know how much internet connections in India suck, so I'd advise asking Riddell for an EC2 instance since usually that's alot faster to work on\n"
p5559
aS'[16:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: omg, very sorry , i just noticed that\n'
p5560
aS'[16:19] <shadeslayer> or buying a dedicated server if you have the moniez\n'
p5561
aS'[16:19] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya\n'
p5562
aS'[16:20] <Riddell> ec2 available on request indeed\n'
p5563
aS'[16:22] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: nevermind, it would only be a problem for someone that uses the ppa\n'
p5564
aS'[16:23] <shadeslayer> Riddell: can you upload PA3 today?\n'
p5565
aS'[16:23] <shadeslayer> I cannot find the time to upload it :|\n'
p5566
aS'[16:23] <shadeslayer> note that the rules could use with a bit of fixing ( needs branch switching )\n'
p5567
aS'[16:25] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: what troubles me more is not the internet speed, it the 2 hrs scheduled power cut. \n'
p5568
aS'[16:25] <shadeslayer> haha\n'
p5569
aS"[16:25] <Riddell> shadeslayer: it's ready?\n"
p5570
aS'[16:25] <shadeslayer> My router + modem combo is on backup power\n'
p5571
aS'[16:25] <shadeslayer> Riddell: yes\n'
p5572
aS'[16:25] <shadeslayer> I tested it, works perfectly\n'
p5573
aS'[16:25] <Riddell> sweet\n'
p5574
aS'[16:26] <Riddell> shadeslayer: from ~kubuntu-active PPA?\n'
p5575
aS'[16:26] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  here no backup\n'
p5576
aS'[16:26] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p5577
aS'[16:26] <shadeslayer> It also changed my configs to be more tablet friendly \n'
p5578
aS'[16:26] <shadeslayer> so when I logged into plasma-desktop, all my buttons were *huge*\n'
p5579
aS'[16:27] <shadeslayer> yofel: apachelogger suggest we should setup a PPA with packages that replace standard kde packages but everything be built from git\n'
p5580
aS'[16:27] <shadeslayer> want to start on that? :D\n'
p5581
aS"[16:28] <Riddell> shadeslayer: mm isn't that neon?\n"
p5582
aS'[16:29] <shadeslayer> Riddell: no, neon installs to /opt/project-neon\n'
p5583
aS"[16:29] <shadeslayer> We're talking about dailies that replace your stable desktop\n"
p5584
aS'[16:29] <Riddell> shadeslayer: the maintinance of that sounds impossible\n'
p5585
aS'[16:29] <shadeslayer> for people living on the extreme edge\n'
p5586
aS"[16:29] <shadeslayer> Riddell: that's what I said as well\n"
p5587
aS"[16:29] <Riddell> there's a reason neon uses simplified packaging\n"
p5588
aS'[16:29] <shadeslayer> *nod*\n'
p5589
aS'[16:30] <shadeslayer> Riddell: possibly apachelogger was drunk or sth\n'
p5590
aS"[16:30] <yofel> well, it's not IMPOSSIBLE with more patterns in install files etc. but it would need some dedicated maintainer (not me)\n"
p5591
aS'[16:31] <yofel> and the launchpad folks would probably want to kill us for building kde daily twice\n'
p5592
aS'[16:31] <shadeslayer> haha\n'
p5593
aS"[16:34] <Alex_Zion> HI guys , i'm pretty sure a lot of user here are on kubuntu devel mailing list, where I post my first post yesterday, it was a well written post !?! , I mean is the first time I write and I never read you mailing list, so I don't know, it was too long, too short, is better put more o less detail or they are just enough !?! and stuff like that , just to teach me even how to write a good and usefull posts on mailing list .. :)\n"
p5594
aS'[16:36] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: you will take care of the rest for libkolab ?\n'
p5595
aS"[16:37] <Riddell> Alex_Zion: a good e-mail, I'm writing a reply now, most of the issues we've considered before however\n"
p5596
aS'[16:37] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: yeah :)\n'

aS'[16:37] <Alex_Zion> well , good to know Riddell ;)\n'

aS'[16:38] <BluesKaj> ok , bbl..stuff to do\n'
p5602
aS'[16:38] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: for libkolab? not from my side\n'
p5603
aS'[16:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in that case good night to you, shadeslayer Riddell. I have learned something today.\n'

p5617
aS'[17:51] <apachelogger> shadeslayer, Riddell: gentoo has a smaller team and they manage to do it...\n'
p5618
aS"[17:52] <yofel> apachelogger: using how simple packaging? (I didn't look at the portage scripts)\n"
p5619
aS'[17:53] <apachelogger> the point is it is no more work than what we do now\n'
p5620
aS'[17:53] <apachelogger> except it is incremental\n'
p5621
aS'[17:53] <yofel> hm\n'
p5622
aS'[17:53] <apachelogger> so half the team does not become unavailable when a kde release is out\n'
p5623
aS'[17:53] <yofel> well\n'
p5624
aS'[17:54] <yofel> I guess I could wrap something up experimentally for the core packages\n'
p5625
aS'[17:54] <shadeslayer> yofel: any ideas how I can get xvfb-run to run multiple commands in one go?\n'
p5626
aS'[17:54] <yofel> no\n'
p5627
aS'[17:54] <apachelogger> I am not saying we should do this for every package, but at least the core monolithic ones\n'
p5628
aS'[17:54] <shadeslayer> :S\n'
p5629
aS'[17:54] <apachelogger> i.e. libs,pimlibs,workspace,baseapps,runtime\n'
p5630
aS"[17:55] <yofel> then you might as well do it for the others as there's not much to maintain there - except running a script to update the version as needed\n"
p5631
aS'[17:55] <apachelogger> or ones where we have an interest in tighlty following development\n'
p5632
aS'[17:55] <apachelogger> yofel: in the long run, yes\n'
p5633
aS'[17:56] <apachelogger> however since there is so little change in the other sources the gain is also smaller\n'
p5634
aS'[17:56] <yofel> well, I get your point about the main packages\n'
p5635
aS'[17:56] <shadeslayer> yay my krunner hanged\n'
p5636
aS'[17:56] <shadeslayer> managed to get some backtrace : http://paste.kde.org/654812/\n'
p5637
aS"[17:57] <yofel> do you want to follow master? As the RC's are branched off and I'm not sure if it makes sense to constantly import all the stable branches\n"
p5638
aS"[17:58] <apachelogger> I'd simply follow master\n"
p5639
aS'[17:58] <apachelogger> from rc to final there is also no significant change that would benefit from incremental updates \n'
p5640
aS"[17:58] <apachelogger> (or at least there should not be ';))\n"
p5641
aS"[18:00] <yofel> apachelogger: how would you handle the branches then? As we'll have to branch our packaging if we do that - or stop using bzr with RC which I don't really want to use\n"
p5642
aS'[18:00] <apachelogger> branch\n'
p5643
aS"[18:00] <yofel> or we simply start using branches in general for every kde release (which'll be a lot)\n"
p5644
aS'[18:00] <apachelogger> we should branch more anyway\n'
p5645
aS'[18:00] <apachelogger> yofel: yeah, a lot, but that is entirely bazaars fault :S\n'
p5646
aS'[18:01] <yofel> ack\n'
p5647
aS"[18:01] <apachelogger> iff launchpad and bazaar supported that workflow better I'd also simply daily build everything we have and branch for each release\n"
p5648
aS"[18:02] <apachelogger> but as it stand we'd then have 5k branches after 1 year ^^\n"
p5649
aS'[18:02] <yofel> who cares? ^^\n'
p5650
aS'[18:04] <apachelogger> makes stuff hard to use for newcomers etc.\n'
p5651
aS'[18:04] <yofel> well, most of us already use kbzr to check stuff out, we can just extend that\n'
p5652
aS'[18:05] <apachelogger> yeah, of *us*\n'
p5653
aS'[18:05] <apachelogger> ^^\n'
p5654
aS'[18:05] <yofel> others are supposed to read the Vcs links in the packages...\n'
p5655
aS'[18:05] <apachelogger> so we need to change those all the time\n'
p5656
aS'[18:05] <apachelogger> also merging between bazaar branches does not give me joy... so much easier with git :P\n'
p5657
aS'[18:05] <yofel> script it\n'
p5658
aS'[18:05] <yofel> true\n'
p5659
aS"[18:08] <yofel> apachelogger: did you have a plan for managing the failure notifications? Other than adding yet another team and using it's ML to handle that\n"
p5660
aS'[18:09] <yofel> also remind me to look at the notifications for ~kubuntu-packagers. Even if CIA is dead I would still like to know when people change something...\n'

p5728
aS'[20:24] <jessie|work> Nevermind, I was lost in the sauce for a moment there.\n'
p5729
aS'[20:24] <shadeslayer> well\n'
p5730
aS'[20:24] <yofel> yeah, nvm\n'
p5731
aS"[20:24] <shadeslayer> because it's perfectly fine to have both of them installed\n"
p5732
aS'[20:24] <shadeslayer> but runtime can cause issues\n'
p5733
aS'[20:24] <jessie|work> I was talking about kio-mtp and misread that as ktp or what not.\n'
p5734
aS'[20:24] <jussi> shadeslayer: cant you just put a nice "confilcts" in there? \n'
p5735
aS"[20:24] <shadeslayer> jussi: why? it's just the runtime that's problematic\n"
p5736
aS'[20:24] <jussi> oh\n'
p5737
aS'[20:25] <jussi> well whatever, its evil and removing it made it work :D\n'
p5738
aS'[20:26] <jussi> shadeslayer: I assume your password protected code hasnt made it into there yet? \n'
p5739
aS'[20:27] <shadeslayer> where? it\n'
p5740
aS'[20:27] <shadeslayer> it made it into master\n'
p5741
aS"[20:27] <shadeslayer> it'll be released with 0.6\n"
p5742
aS'[20:27] <jussi> shadeslayer: doesnt seem to work on the daily ppa thing installed here\n'

aS'[20:28] <shadeslayer> make sure you logout && login\n'
p5746
aS'[20:40] <shadeslayer> yofel: I got it to work, but it requires introduction of magic numbers\n'
p5747
aS'[20:40] <shadeslayer> will show you once I do another rebuild\n'
p5748
aS'[20:40] <yofel> ... what?\n'
p5749
aS'[20:40] <shadeslayer> yeah\n'
p5750
aS'[20:42] <cyphermox> ScottK: hi\n'
p5751
aS'[20:42] <yofel> shadeslayer: anyway, you said that wrapping dh_auto_test in xvfb-run makes the tests build in general, right?\n'
p5752
aS'[20:43] <yofel> should we do that in neon?\n'
p5753
aS'[20:43] <shadeslayer> yes it does\n'
p5754
aS'[20:43] <shadeslayer> maybe?\n'
p5755
aS"[20:43] <yofel> I'll give it some tries later\n"
p5756
aS"[20:43] <shadeslayer> it'll need kde-runtime and kdelibs-bin installed\n"
p5757
aS'[20:43] <shadeslayer> oh and kdelibs plugins \n'
p5758
aS"[20:44] <yofel> ok, kdelibs is a non-issue, kde-runtime we'll have to see\n"
p5759
aS'[20:46] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/654968/\n'
p5760
aS"[20:46] <shadeslayer> though I'm thinking of making a while loop\n"
p5761
aS'[20:46] <shadeslayer> to check the pidof kompare\n'
p5762
aS"[20:46] <shadeslayer> that's just a hack I threw together :P\n"
p5763
aS'[20:47] <yofel> shadeslayer: that immediately reminded me of http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Too-Much-Sleep.aspx\n'
p5764
aS'[20:47] <yofel> though not as bad ^^\n'
p5765
aS'[20:48] <shadeslayer> hehe\n'

p5772
aS'[21:01] <shadeslayer> yofel: any ideas how to make it check for a null pid again and again?\n'
p5773
aS'[21:02] <yofel> vassie: that would be Riddell probably :)\n'
p5774
aS"[21:02] <vassie> yofel: yes, didn't know if he was online\n"
p5775
aS'[21:03] <yofel> shadeslayer: null pid? as in whether pidof returns nothing?\n'
p5776
aS'[21:03] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p5777
aS'[21:03] <shadeslayer> as in, keep polling till you get a pid\n'
p5778
aS"[21:04] <yofel> uh, assign the output to a variable and check if that's -z?\n"
p5779
aS'[21:05] <shadeslayer> sure, but how do I loop over that\n'
p5780
aS'[21:06] <yofel> the tricky part would be knowing when to stop...\n'
p5781
aS"[21:07] <shadeslayer> when it's not zero? :P\n"
p5782
aS"[21:07] <yofel> and how many kompare's do you need to kill?\n"
p5783
aS'[21:07] <shadeslayer> just the one\n'
p5784
aS"[21:08] <yofel> hm, I got more than one here, but if it's just one..\n"
p5785
aS'[21:10] <shadeslayer> oh\n'
p5786
aS'[21:11] <shadeslayer> I think I figured it out\n'

aS'[21:11] <Riddell> evening\n'
p5788
aS'[21:11] <Riddell> hi vassie, welcome along\n'

p5792

p5793
aS'[21:11] <yofel> done\n'
p5794
aS'[21:11] <vassie> Riddell: hello\n'
p5795
aS"[21:13] <vassie> Riddell: i've been playing around with cantata and it compiles fine on 12.10, but i'm using checkinstall to build a deb, which i assume isn't very clean?\n"
p5796
aS"[21:18] <vassie> Riddell: i'm more than happy to help officially package it, or create my own ppa\n"
p5797
aS'[21:19] <shadeslayer> bah\n'
p5798
aS'[21:19] <shadeslayer> yofel: the build fails when doing pidof kompare\n'
p5799
aS"[21:19] <shadeslayer> because there's no compare\n"
p5800
aS"[21:20] <shadeslayer> I'll have to add -\n"
p5801
aS'[21:20] <yofel> was just about to ask how you run it, but if that works do it\n'

p5803
aS'[21:26] <Riddell> vassie: awooga\n'
p5804
aS'[21:26] <Riddell> vassie: want me to take you through it now? will probably take about an hour\n'
p5805
aS'[21:27] <yofel> shadeslayer: line 15 should use the var, no?\n'
p5806
aS'[21:27] <shadeslayer> yes\n'
p5807
aS'[21:27] <shadeslayer> :P\n'
p5808

aS"[21:27] <vassie> Riddell: that would be awesome, but i'm going to have to go offline soon, is it ok if i mail you?\n"
p5811
aS'[21:28] <shadeslayer> I think I should sleep now\n'
p5812
aS'[21:28] <Riddell> vassie: yeah we can find another time if that works better\n'
p5813
aS'[21:28] <shadeslayer> last rebuild\n'
p5814
aS'[21:28] <shadeslayer> yofel: I still think the loop is wrong btw\n'
p5815
aS'[21:28] <vassie> Riddell: thank you, i appreciate the help\n'
p5816
aS'[21:29] <yofel> s/$(komparePid)/$$komparePid/ maybe\n'
p5817
aS'[21:29] <kubotu> yofel: You did something wrong... Try s/you/me/ or tell me "help sed"\n'
p5818
aS'[21:29] <yofel> be quiet kubotu\n'
p5819
aS'[21:36] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/655028/\n'
p5820
aS'[21:37] <yofel> shadeslayer: oh, the loop needs to be on one line, so use \\\n'
p5821
aS'[21:37] <shadeslayer> ahh\n'
p5822
aS'[21:37] <yofel> and move the - before the while I guess\n'
p5823
aS'[21:37] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'
p5824
aS'[21:39] <shadeslayer> wat\n'
p5825
aS'[21:39] <shadeslayer> kquitapp(26170): "Application kompare-6356 could not be found using service org.kde.kompare-6356 and path /MainApplication." \n'

p5827
aS'[22:03] <shadeslayer> yofel: odd\n'
p5828
aS'[22:04] <shadeslayer> very odd\n'

p5830
aS"[22:05] <shadeslayer> but let's say I do qdbus\n"
p5831
aS'[22:05] <yofel> qdbus on the right dbus session?\n'
p5832
aS'[22:05] <shadeslayer> dunn\n'
p5833
aS'[22:05] <shadeslayer> I get : Could not connect to D-Bus server: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Spawn.ExecFailed: //bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally with the following error: No protocol specified\n'

p5837
aS'[22:11] <shadeslayer> too tired for this\n'
p5838
aS'[22:12] <yofel> do so, good job getting so far :)\n'
p5839
aS'[22:12] <shadeslayer> yeah, maybe I can figure out the solution in my sleep xD\n'

p5854
aS'[00:20] <Riddell> your patch doesnae apply\n'
p5855
aS'[00:21] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: ya i can see that\n'
p5856
aS'[00:21] <Riddell> open the patch and src/uriencode.cpp in an editor and decide if it still needs to apply\n'
p5857
aS'[00:21] <Riddell> if not delete the patch and entry from debian/patches/series\n'
p5858
aS'[00:21] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: Its not my patch\n'
p5859
aS"[00:22] <Riddell> I know, it's mine :)\n"
p5860
aS'[00:23] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: so i have to remove the patches?\n'
p5861
aS'[00:23] <Riddell> you have to decide if it still needs to apply\n'
p5862
aS'[00:23] <Riddell> or if whatever the patch was for has been fixed\n'
p5863
aS'[00:24] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: the packagers decide on that?\n'
p5864
aS"[00:24] <Riddell> there's nobody here but us chickens\n"
p5865
aS"[00:25] <Riddell> oh I'm taking wrongful credit, it's apachelogger's patch\n"
p5866
aS'[00:25] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: so looks like a patch to fix a mistake in the code, look at the code and see if that mistake has been fixed\n'
p5867
aS'[00:26] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: ok\n'
p5868
aS'[00:27] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: manual patching allowed?\n'
p5869
aS'[00:29] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: how do you mean?\n'
p5870
aS'[00:29] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: If the patch are ok and it was not applied previously? can we patch the source manually?\n'
p5871
aS'[00:30] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: are you still talking about kubuntu_fix_curl_constness.patch ?\n'
p5872
aS'[00:31] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: ya and it seems the patch was already applied\n'
p5873
aS'[00:32] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: so, now i have to just delete the corresponding .patch file from debian/patch/ ?\n'
p5874
aS'[00:34] <Riddell> yep\n'
p5875
aS'[00:34] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: both the patches are already applied\n'

aS'[00:34] <Riddell> and the name from debian/patches/series\n'
p5877
aS'[00:35] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: does the patch dir have to remain?\n'
p5878
aS'[00:35] <Riddell> our patches go upstream, we rock\n'
p5879
aS"[00:35] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: doesn't matter either way\n"
p5880
aS'[00:35] <phoenix_firebrd> nice\n'
p5881
aS'[00:35] <phoenix_firebrd> i have removed the patch dir\n'
p5882

aS'[00:37] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: ya doing that\n'

aS'[00:43] <Riddell> so it must have been applied somehow\n'
p5892
aS'[00:43] <Riddell> start again\n'

aS'[10:00] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: morning\n'
p5951
aS'[10:00] <apachelogger> hey phoenix_firebrd\n'
p5952
aS'[10:00] <apachelogger> Riddell: it appears you are overly dismissive of the ideas on the ML :P\n'
p5953
aS'[10:01] <apachelogger> more importantly tho, go fix your mail client\n'
p5954
aS'[10:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what does those two lines for pbuilderrc does?\n'
p5955
aS'[10:02] <apachelogger> I really do not get why everyone is so hung up on the browser question though\n'
p5956
aS'[10:02] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: debault browser?\n'
p5957
aS'[10:02] <apachelogger> yes\n'
p5958
aS'[10:03] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: it replaces sync() and fsync() system calls with a NOOP, which makes package installation a LOT faster\n'
p5959
aS'[10:03] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: rekonq +1\n'
p5960
aS'[10:03] <yofel> rekonq +0\n'
p5961
aS'[10:03] <apachelogger> curl ftw\n'
p5962
aS'[10:03] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what do you prefer?\n'
p5963
aS'[10:03] <Tm_T> KDE browser +1 (Konqueror +2)\n'
p5964
aS'[10:03] <yofel> rekonq 2.0 is ok, but it took it 3 minutes(!) stuck with 100%CPU to open a simply gzipped buildlog from launchpad yesterday\n'
p5965
aS"[10:04] <yofel> I'm presonally a firefox person, but I use firefox, chromium and rekonq at the same time sometimes\n"
p5966
aS'[10:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: but what about the gtk dep\n'
p5967
aS'[10:04] <apachelogger> so\n'
p5968
aS'[10:04] <Tm_T> I use lynx quite often /:\n'
p5969
aS'[10:04] <apachelogger> webkit > gecko\n'
p5970
aS'[10:05] <apachelogger> because webkit > khtml > gecko\n'
p5971
aS"[10:05] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: I said what I use, please don't use what I use as the default\n"
p5972
aS'[10:05] <Tm_T> apachelogger: you mean kthml > all ?\n'
p5973
aS'[10:05] <Tm_T> khtml too\n'
p5974
aS'[10:05] <apachelogger> did you look at the code? :P\n'
p5975
aS'[10:05] <apachelogger> like ... brrrrr\n'
p5976
aS'[10:05] <Tm_T> apachelogger: oh yes I have done that\n'
p5977
aS'[10:05] <apachelogger> hence why webkit is superior\n'
p5978
aS'[10:05] <apachelogger> tho its code is also brrrr\n'
p5979
aS'[10:06] <apachelogger> yet it is less of a lolwut kind of brrrr\n'
p5980
aS'[10:06]  * apachelogger will one of these days get a discussion about who the actual target audience of kubuntu is\n'
p5981
aS"[10:06] <yofel> but I'm together with apachelogger that I don't understand why people make such a fuss about the default browser\n"
p5982
aS"[10:07] <yofel> rekonq works for most things, if you need something else freakin' install it\n"
p5983
aS'[10:07] <Tm_T> apachelogger: us ofcourse (;\n'
p5984
aS'[10:07] <yofel> rekonq 2.1 will even have a usable history tab\n'
p5985
aS'[10:08] <apachelogger> >>I use a lot the button to "keep Above Others", and I\'m quite sure most of the new user not even knows it can be done, instead once is there it\'s really easy to understand how and when to use it.<<\n'
p5986
aS'[10:08] <Tm_T> I still miss the bookmark bar from Konqueror when I use other browsers /:\n'
p5987
aS"[10:08] <apachelogger> so, if I were not so lazy I'd search for a study on why in fact that is not and easy to understand feature\n"
p5988
aS"[10:08] <yofel> apachelogger: that would be something I curse windows for not having, but that's probably jsut me\n"
p5989
aS'[10:08] <apachelogger> as useful as it is, it entirely requires thinking outside the box\n'
p5990
aS"[10:09] <yofel> wasn't it enabled in kde3 times though?\n"
p5991
aS'[10:09] <apachelogger> alas, I fail to think of one real world example where you can keep something above everything else without having to reorder\n'
p5992
aS'[10:10] <apachelogger> oh, well, dirt on ones glasses work that way\n'
p5993
aS'[10:10] <apachelogger> yofel: I believe so, yes\n'
p5994
aS"[10:11] <apachelogger> it's not that the button being there does any harm\n"
p5995
aS'[10:11] <apachelogger> kinda messes with visual balance though\n'
p5996
aS'[10:11] <apachelogger> and since normal people will have a hard time grasping the concept it is not worthwhile\n'
p5997
aS"[10:12] <yofel> i have: 'on all desktops' 'keep above' 'shade' <title> 'min' 'max' 'close'\n"
p5998
aS'[10:12] <yofel> perfectly balanced\n'
p5999
aS'[10:12] <apachelogger> or the supreme reasoning of why not to have it: nuno wanted it gone\n'
p6000
aS'[10:12] <yofel> ah ok\n'
p6001
aS'[10:12] <apachelogger> yofel: actually that sounds more like your window will eventually fall over to the right :P\n'
p6002
aS"[10:12] <apachelogger> that's what I mean with visual balance\n"
p6003
aS'[10:12] <yofel> note that title is in the middle\n'
p6004
aS'[10:13] <apachelogger> yeah\n'
p6005
aS'[10:13] <apachelogger> so it goes\n'
p6006
aS"[10:13] <yofel> ok, so it's 4:3 including the icon, but still\n"
p6007
aS'[10:13] <apachelogger> [o]                    super app     [a] [i] [p] [y] [x]\n'
p6008
aS"[10:14] <apachelogger> if you had the title left it'd be better\n"
p6009
aS'[10:14] <Tm_T> [menu]    konsole    [maximize]\n'
p6010
aS'[10:14] <apachelogger> but then the title suddenly becomes an element of visual balance\n'
p6011
aS"[10:14] <apachelogger> so that's bad\n"
p6012
aS'[10:14] <apachelogger> like really bad\n'
p6013
aS'[10:15] <apachelogger> as a short title will again endanger the window of falling over to the right, and a long one may make it fall ot the left\n'
p6014
aS'[10:15] <yofel> [o] [a] [i] [j]        foo       [v] [^] [X]\n'
p6015
aS'[10:15] <apachelogger> yofel: yeah, that works\n'
p6016
aS'[10:15] <apachelogger> crowded though etc.\n'
p6017
aS'[10:15] <apachelogger> Tm_T: with you on that\n'
p6018
aS'[10:15] <yofel> well, I think I\'ll drop "shade" - I never use that...\n'
p6019
aS'[10:16] <apachelogger> yofel: truth be told, I use a lot of that crap, but I do not use it as often as I use max or close for example\n'
p6020
aS'[10:16] <apachelogger> in fact it may be 10:1\n'
p6021
aS"[10:16] <Tm_T> apachelogger: I less is better with those buttons I'd say\n"
p6022
aS'[10:16] <apachelogger> so I personally find it perfectly acceptable to right click on the window and activate the magic from the menu\n'
p6023
aS'[10:16] <yofel> yeah\n'
p6024
aS'[10:17] <Tm_T> triple click on menu does close the window, so close button is not needed\n'
p6025
aS'[10:17] <apachelogger> Tm_T: absolutely agreed, though your 2 button lineup can only be pulled of by keyboard users ^^\n'
p6026
aS'[10:17] <Tm_T> and double click on titlebar minimizes so no need for a button with that (;\n'
p6027
aS"[10:18] <Tm_T> apachelogger: yeah, my config isn't for others anyway\n"
p6028
aS"[10:18] <Tm_T> but there's a balance what is really needed by default\n"
p6029
aS"[10:18] <apachelogger> it's a config made to enjoy .prn I think\n"
p6030
aS'[10:18] <yofel> lol\n'
p6031
aS'[10:18] <Tm_T> huh?\n'
p6032
aS'[10:18] <apachelogger> less chrome = more prn\n'
p6033
aS'[10:19] <Tm_T> naah, more like this: http://www.tm-travolta.net/shots/wut.png\n'
p6034
aS"[10:20] <apachelogger> JontheEchidna: didn't we remove quickaccess for lack of maintainership?\n"
p6035
aS'[10:20] <apachelogger> Tm_T: ascii prn then\n'
p6036
aS'[10:20] <apachelogger> all the same to me\n'
p6037
aS'[10:21] <Tm_T> apachelogger: yeah, all those log files are pure prn (;\n'
p6038
aS'[10:21] <apachelogger> "I guess a second panel on the top of the screen can do most of the job "\n'
p6039
aS'[10:21] <apachelogger> I seem to have seen something like this before\n'
p6040
aS'[10:21] <apachelogger> hm, where was it\n'
p6041
aS"[10:22] <yofel> please... no. I have 2 panels, but they're left and right where it hurts the least\n"
p6042
aS'[10:22] <apachelogger> ^^\n'
p6043
aS'[10:23] <apachelogger> being a buddhist and all, I have to say the following about 2 panels\n'
p6044
aS'[10:23] <yofel> if anything go the ubuntu way for 2 panels. We would at least have an excuse for that\n'
p6045
aS'[10:23] <apachelogger> if you have so much crap that you cannot fit it all in one panel, the solution is not to add more panels but remove crap\n'
p6046
aS'[10:24] <mikhas> would you like a third panel?\n'
p6047
aS'[10:24] <Tm_T> are we talking about plasma panels now?\n'
p6048
aS'[10:24] <apachelogger> yofel: top-bottom panels do not work well unless they are relatively small in height OR the screen is of appropriately size\n'
p6049
aS'[10:24] <yofel> ack\n'
p6050
aS'[10:25] <apachelogger> language fail right there\n'
p6051
aS'[10:25] <apachelogger> anywho\n'
p6052
aS'[10:25] <apachelogger> that is why in gnome2 the panels where rather tiny\n'
p6053
aS'[10:25] <Tm_T> one panel has to be enough for default\n'
p6054
aS'[10:25] <apachelogger> otherwise on a small screen you get the feeling that they are crushing your windows or something\n'
p6055
aS'[10:25] <yofel> gnome2 worked really well on 4:3 screens\n'
p6056
aS'[10:25] <apachelogger> yofel: yeah\n'
p6057
aS'[10:26] <apachelogger> now take kde with the super huge panels and try that on a small 4:3 screen\n'
p6058
aS'[10:26] <apachelogger> to pull that off almost all plasmoids would have to be redone to not waste space the way they do\n'
p6059
aS'[10:26] <apachelogger> (though perhaps that should be done anyway ^^)\n'
p6060
aS'[10:27] <apachelogger> mikhas: we have 4 edges, if anything we should have 4 panels :P\n'
p6061
aS"[10:27] <mikhas> triangular-shaped screens are the future, I'm telling you \xe2\x80\xa6\n"
p6062
aS'[10:28] <apachelogger> actually someone told me spherical\n'
p6063
aS'[10:28] <apachelogger> though I cannot remember why\n'
p6064
aS'[10:28] <apachelogger> to close a window you shake the sphere\n'
p6065
aS'[10:28] <apachelogger> \\o/\n'
p6066
aS'[10:28] <apachelogger> oh one more though on the panel thing ... the more plasmoids you add to plasma the higher the risk it will crash\n'
p6067
aS'[10:28] <apachelogger> ...\n'
p6068
aS'[10:30] <Riddell> ug, you want precious screen space to be taken up by toys?\n'
p6069
aS'[10:31] <tsimpson> you could use a "showcase" activity, have the default activity nice and clean and have another full of crud.. er toys\n'
p6070
aS'[10:32] <tsimpson> though that assumes people know how to get from one activity to the other, or even know what they are\n'
p6071
aS'[10:34] <yofel> "-add more monochromatic icons for all notification-helpers. Please use existing or talk to Nuno Pinheiro. "\n'
p6072
aS'[10:34] <yofel> WHY? Why does everyone to have anything in mono? Sure, it *looks* good, but usability--\n'
p6073
aS'[10:34] <yofel> add want in there\n'
p6074
aS'[10:37] <apachelogger> ah\n'
p6075
aS'[10:37] <apachelogger> again I disagree about the problem statement :P\n'
p6076
aS'[10:38] <apachelogger> the icons should not be mono, there should be less notification helper icons\n'
p6077
aS'[10:38] <yofel> huh? how much are there? I only see the additional-stuff and reboot ones usually\n'
p6078
aS'[10:38] <apachelogger> ultimately only reboot and hooks notification\n'
p6079
aS'[10:38] <apachelogger> both of which ought to be drawing attention as they are kinda important usually\n'
p6080
aS'[10:38] <apachelogger> yofel: the additional stuff ones should not be there\n'
p6081
aS'[10:39] <yofel> where then? a non-expiring notification?\n'
p6082
aS'[10:39] <apachelogger> no notification\n'
p6083
aS"[10:39] <yofel> now I'm confused\n"
p6084
aS'[10:39] <apachelogger> it should be inside the app\n'
p6085
aS'[10:39] <apachelogger> like the additional wallpaper thingy\n'
p6086
aS'[10:40] <yofel> where in rekonq would you add the flash installer then?\n'
p6087
aS'[10:40] <apachelogger> the notifications were a quick solution with minimally invasive patching\n'
p6088
aS'[10:40] <apachelogger> yofel: detect flash plugins and replace the plugin component with a thingy that installs\n'
p6089
aS'[10:40] <apachelogger> or if it must be a notification *inside* the app\n'
p6090
aS'[10:41] <yofel> ok, and now something that we have the manpower to do?\n'
p6091
aS'[10:41] <yofel> (other than patches welcome)\n'
p6092
aS'[10:42] <apachelogger> yofel: you sure that excuse qualifies as reason not to target that problem resolution?\n'
p6093
aS'[10:43] <yofel> not really\n'
p6094
aS'[10:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: from which directory i have to run quilt for patching?\n'
p6095
aS'[10:47] <apachelogger> Riddell: there is a legit question at the heart of this ... how do we educate/show users what they can or may want to do with plasma\n'
p6096
aS'[10:47] <apachelogger> and perhaps at least as important ... do we even want that\n'
p6097
aS'[10:47] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: source base dir\n'
p6098
aS'[10:47] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: like force feed the?\n'
p6099
aS'[10:47] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: like force feed them?\n'
p6100
aS'[10:47] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: oh, wait\n'
p6101
aS'[10:48] <apachelogger> phoenix_firebrd: yes\n'
p6102
aS'[10:48] <apachelogger> though it is a terrible unsuitable phrase to use\n'
p6103
aS'[10:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: one file is in the sorce dir and the other is in sorce.orig dir\n'
p6104
aS'[10:48] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: put this in your .quiltrc http://paste.kde.org/655298\n'
p6105
aS'[10:48] <apachelogger> you cannot be force fed software unless you cannot remove it :P\n'
p6106
aS'[10:48] <yofel> ~/.quiltrc\n'
p6107
aS'[10:49] <yofel> well, upstream does have a few "showcase" activities\n'
p6108
aS"[10:49] <yofel> so that's not wrong pre se\n"
p6109
aS"[10:50] <Riddell> apachelogger: I recon that users who like wee widgets will be the sort of user to play with settings enough to find them, it's not hard there's a cashew thing to click on right there\n"
p6110
aS'[10:50] <apachelogger> such that you always end up with either an opt-in or opt-out approach, e.g. our default distro comes with very few plunder so you need to install more plunder yourself, out of the box windows computers come with all sorts of plunder from the oem so you need to manually remove stuff you do not want\n'
p6111
aS'[10:51] <apachelogger> I personally favor our approach but it has the problem that a user may not know how one can make advanced use of $software and how that may improve ones productiveness or computing experience\n'
p6112
aS'[10:52] <apachelogger> Riddell: what about activities\n'
p6113
aS'[10:53] <Riddell> write good docs? make an interactive intro to plasma widget?\n'
p6114
aS'[10:53] <apachelogger> possible solutions indeed\n'
p6115
aS'[10:53] <apachelogger> so someone should write that as a reply :P\n'
p6116
aS'[10:53] <Riddell> yeah I think we should replace default virtual desktops with default activities\n'
p6117
aS'[10:54] <Riddell> but I do think the way of interactive with activities is not intuitive at all\n'
p6118
aS"[10:54] <apachelogger> Riddell: that's why I thought you were dismissive btw, a first start introduction is not a bad idea as such, it getting in the way of using is\n"
p6119
aS'[10:54] <yofel> I have one use for them: have a completely empty desktop for presentations at work. End of use case\n'
p6120
aS'[10:54] <apachelogger> an issue nicely worked around by making any such intro either an app that does not start by default or is a plasma widget\n'
p6121
aS'[10:55] <apachelogger> yofel: lol\n'
p6122
aS'[10:55] <apachelogger> so\n'
p6123
aS'[10:55] <apachelogger> I always end up loosing windows in some activity\n'
p6124
aS'[10:56] <yofel> ... or end up having stuff consuming memory that you forgot about\n'
p6125
aS'[10:57] <apachelogger> *nod*\n'
p6126
aS'[10:57] <apachelogger> not my kind of concept\n'
p6127
aS'[10:57] <apachelogger> then again I never used vdesktops either\n'
p6128
aS"[10:58] <yofel> I do, but that's a matter of taste. If there was a pager-like widget for activities I would probably use them\n"
p6129
aS'[11:03] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this is the patch http://paste.kde.org/655316/ take a look at the file locations, now from which dir i should run quilt\n'
p6130
aS"[11:04] <yofel> after you created the .quiltrc that I posted, go into libkolabxml-0.8.2 and run 'quilt push' in there\n"
p6131
aS'[11:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its cutmp3\n'
p6132
aS'[11:04] <yofel> ah, same procedure though\n'
p6133
aS'[11:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: did you see this https://launchpad.net/~murthy/+archive/test/+packages\n'
p6134
aS'[11:05] <yofel> not yet, I can review kolabxml later\n'
p6135
aS'[11:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6136
aS'[11:05] <yofel> kolab would be waiting for shadeslayer I guess - if he can figure it out\n'
p6137
aS'[11:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya\n'
p6138
aS'[11:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: when i run quilt from inside the source dir it fails \n'
p6139
aS'[11:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the source.orig dir is outside\n'
p6140
aS'[11:06] <phoenix_firebrd> also i updated the quiltrc with the code that you gave \n'
p6141
aS'[11:07] <yofel> it fails with what error message?\n'
p6142
aS'[11:07] <phoenix_firebrd> the .quiltrc file is in home dir\n'

aS'[11:51] <yofel> there was a message about swig not being found and a warning about Qt not being there\n'
p6161
aS"[11:51] <yofel> they're both optional, so it built. But do try to get everything working as long as it's there\n"
p6162
aS'[11:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: yesterday i added swig\n'
p6163
aS"[11:51] <yofel> (or as long as we don't have a reason for not using it)\n"
p6164
aS'[11:52] <yofel> that was in kolab I think - kolabxml already had swig2.0, but it uses swig, not swig2.0\n'
p6165
aS'[11:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6166
aS'[11:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: whats the time?\n'
p6167
aS'[11:53] <yofel> time?\n'
p6168
aS'[11:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: where do you live?\n'
p6169
aS'[11:53] <yofel> Stuttgart/Germany\n'
p6170
aS'[11:53] <yofel> so almost 1pm now here\n'
p6171
aS'[11:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: 12 54 pm?\n'
p6172
aS'[11:54] <Riddell> hi vassie \n'
p6173
aS'[11:54] <yofel> yep\n'
p6174
aS'[11:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can you build cutmp3\n'
p6175
aS'[11:54] <vassie> Riddell: hello :)\n'
p6176
aS"[11:56] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: as I don't have upload permissions for cutmp3 a MOTU or core-dev should do that\n"
p6177
aS'[11:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no just build\n'
p6178
aS'[11:56] <yofel> well ok, that I can do\n'
p6179
aS'[11:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have doubts in the patching\n'
p6180
aS'[11:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: tell me when the patching fails\n'
p6181
aS'[11:59] <yofel> patch works when you change the VERSION from 2.0.2 to 2.1 - the patch initially fails because the patch context changed\n'
p6182
aS'[11:59] <vassie> Riddell: i have some time now if you are free>\n'
p6183
aS'[12:00] <Riddell> vassie: awooga\n'
p6184
aS'[12:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so you mofify the patch?\n'
p6185
aS'[12:00] <phoenix_firebrd> *modify\n'
p6186
aS'[12:01] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: tell me what you did\n'
p6187
aS"[12:01] <yofel> yep, in this case it's easy. Worst case you would have to force apply the patch, manually integrate all rejected hunks and refresh the patch\n"
p6188
aS'[12:02] <yofel> in the patch, replace  VERSION=2.0.2 with  VERSION=2.1 - which is what the Makefile has now\n'
p6189
aS'[12:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok, now debuild?\n'
p6190
aS"[12:04] <yofel> run 'quilt push' to verify that the patch applies fine, then debuild\n"
p6191
aS'[12:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: works\n'
p6192
aS'[12:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i never thought we had permission to mmodify the patch\n'
p6193
aS'[12:07] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: patches are modifications to the application added by the packagers - i.e. by *you*\n'
p6194
aS"[12:07] <yofel> and usually we don't modify the patches, but if the don't apply, we have to fix them\n"
p6195
aS"[12:08] <yofel> or decide what else we're supposed to do with them\n"
p6196
aS'[12:08] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I thought its a patch for the devs\n'
p6197
aS'[12:09] <yofel> define "dev" - a packager counts as distribution developer. Upstream developers rarley provide patches. But if they do, then it\'s our job to add them - or not\n'
p6198
aS'[12:10] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can the following message be removed from the log \n'
p6199
aS'[12:10] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: "ERROR: ld.so: object \'/usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so\' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored."\n'
p6200
aS"[12:10] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: run pbuilder update once. The eatmydata package isn't yet installed\n"
p6201
aS'[12:10] <yofel> it needs to be installed in the chroot to work\n'
p6202
aS"[12:11] <yofel> that's what EXTRAPACKAGES does, but not during 'build'\n"
p6203
aS'[12:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no need to set the distribution for updating pbuilder ?\n'
p6204
aS'[12:12] <yofel> what do you mean? just call pbuilder as you usually do, just with update instad of build\n'
p6205
aS'[12:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: updating\n'
p6206
aS'[12:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i thought a patch is created by the application dev and to patch the source only by them\n'
p6207
aS'[12:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I can remember you added my kmix patch once\n'
p6208
aS'[12:14] <yofel> no, the patches in debian/patches/ are distribution patches. The packagers decide what goes in there and what not\n'
p6209
aS'[12:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, learned that today\n'
p6210
aS'[12:14] <yofel> sure, we do have upstream patches, or cherry-picked upstream commits in there sometimes. But we have plenty of kubuntu-only stuff too\n'
p6211
aS"[12:15] <yofel> kubuntu-only should be prevented if anyhow possible, but sometimes it's simply a distro-specific change\n"
p6212
aS'[12:16] <yofel> like that makefile patch which is simply needed to get the application to build a proper archive package\n'
p6213
aS'[12:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so in the case of cutmp3 we have modified the patch, so what should we say in the change log?\n'
p6214
aS'[12:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: "corrected version number in the patch?"\n'
p6215
aS'[12:17] <yofel> uh... "Refresh <patchname> for the new release" or so\n'
p6216
aS'[12:18] <yofel> changelog entries use present tense btw.\n'
p6217
aS'[12:18] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6218
aS'[12:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: even after updating the pbuilder i am getting the error message\n'
p6219
aS'[12:19] <yofel> do mention the patch name in the changelog though when you change it. Makes it easier to find all changes to it when you search through the changelog later\n'
p6220
aS'[12:19] <yofel> hm, weird\n'
p6221
aS'[12:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6222
aS'[12:19] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: try update --override-config\n'
p6223
aS'[12:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: omg its updating to precise\n'
p6224
aS'[12:20] <yofel> huh?\n'
p6225
aS'[12:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: by default when creating its getting precise\n'
p6226
aS'[12:21] <yofel> ouch\n'
p6227
aS'[12:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: when we create does the cache get destroyed?\n'
p6228
aS"[12:21] <yofel> sorry then, I manage my tars by release, so that doesn't happen here\n"
p6229
aS"[12:22] <yofel> I don't think so, only the base.tgz should be re-created\n"
p6230
aS'[12:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i will try to update with --distribution raring\n'
p6231
aS'[12:23] <yofel> ok\n'
p6232
aS'[12:23] <phoenix_firebrd> works\n'
p6233
aS'[12:23] <phoenix_firebrd> updating to raring\n'
p6234
aS"[12:24] <yofel> here's my pbuilderrc if you find anything useful: http://paste.kde.org/655358/\n"
p6235
aS'[12:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have saved your pbuilderrc as a file, i will go throught it\n'
p6236
aS'[12:27] <yofel> we need to put a set of defaults somewhere...\n'
p6237
aS'[12:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the error messages still show up\n'
p6238
aS'[12:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what defaults?\n'
p6239
aS'[12:28] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: odd, can you pastebin your pbuilderrc?\n'
p6240
aS'[12:28] <yofel> some pbuilder settings that make sense by default for us\n'
p6241
aS"[12:28] <yofel> there is one on https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/Ninjas/BuildEnvironment but it's a bit outdated\n"
p6242
aS'[12:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6243
aS'[12:28] <yofel> (actually the whole page is)\n'
p6244
aS'[12:29] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/655364/\n'
p6245
aS'[12:30] <yofel> wth, that looks right.\n'
p6246
aS'[12:30] <yofel> can you login to your pbuilder and check if eatmydata is installed?\n'
p6247
aS'[12:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6248
aS'[12:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have logged in, how can i check if it is installed?\n'
p6249
aS'[12:31] <yofel> apt-cache policy eatmydata\n'
p6250
aS'[12:32] <phoenix_firebrd> Installed: 26-2\n'
p6251
aS'[12:33] <yofel> and you got no ld.so error while looking that up?\n'
p6252
aS"[12:34] <phoenix_firebrd> ERROR: ld.so: object '/usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.\n"
p6253
aS'[12:34] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: does this channel have a bot?\n'
p6254
aS'[12:34] <yofel> 2, ubottu and kubotu - depends on what you need\n'
p6255
aS'[12:34] <yofel> actually 3 counting the logbot\n'
p6256
aS'[12:35] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the one that alerts when you paste huge data\n'
p6257
aS'[12:35] <yofel> ah floodbot, no, intentionally not\n'
p6258
aS'[12:35] <phoenix_firebrd> ya right\n'
p6259
aS'[12:35] <phoenix_firebrd> nice\n'
p6260
aS'[12:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I wont flood :)\n'
p6261
aS'[12:36] <yofel> weird though that eatmydata is installed and it complains about it not being there\n'
p6262
aS'[12:36] <yofel>  /usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so exists in the chroot, right?\n'
p6263
aS'[12:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i will check\n'
p6264
aS'[12:37] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: yes\n'
p6265
aS'[12:37] <yofel> o.O\n'
p6266
aS'[12:37] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: even looks fine with ldd\n'
p6267
aS"[12:38] <yofel> I guess disable it for now as I'm out of ideas\n"
p6268
aS'[12:38] <yofel> without that pbuilder is a bit of a pain though :(\n'
p6269
aS'[12:39] <yofel> (unless you have a SSD)\n'
p6270
aS'[12:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  I build with root permission , does that affect?\n'
p6271
aS'[12:39] <yofel> or enough memory to build in a tmpfs (i.e. 16GiB or so)\n'
p6272
aS'[12:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have 999mb left in root\n'
p6273
aS"[12:40] <yofel> well, I do too, but I use sudo -E to keep the env settings. But if it would loos those then LD_PRELOAD wouldn't be set in the first place\n"
p6274
aS'[12:40] <yofel> oops, that might be a bit small for some packages\n'
p6275
aS'[12:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya\n'
p6276
aS'[12:40] <yofel> (digikam for example easily takes 5G)\n'
p6277
aS'[12:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya\n'
p6278
aS"[12:50]  * yofel wonders what else you could update - library packages aren't exactly the easiest thing to start with\n"
p6279
aS'[12:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I added this to the changelog for cutmp3 "-Refresh 01-makefile.patch for the new release" \\\n'
p6280
aS"[12:57] <phoenix_firebrd> I didn't modify anything else\n"
p6281
aS"[12:57] <yofel> yeah, that's ok\n"
p6282
aS'[12:57] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: If its ok with you, i am enjoying building the libs\n'
p6283
aS'[12:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I am just learning the basic by unconventional method :)\n'
p6284
aS'[13:01] <yofel> kile has an update\n'
p6285
aS'[13:01]  * yofel was looking for something we keep in bzr though\n'
p6286
aS'[13:01] <yofel> but I guess we can throw kile in bzr\n'
p6287
aS'[13:03] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I have no idea what you are talking about\n'
p6288
aS"[13:03] <yofel> I'll try to clear that up\n"
p6289
aS'[13:03] <yofel> do you know what bzr is?\n'
p6290
aS'[13:03] <yofel> or git or svn for that matter?\n'
p6291
aS'[13:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya i am using git and bazaar\n'
p6292
aS'[13:05] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: libkolab all done?\n'
p6293
aS'[13:06] <yofel> Riddell: that was waiting on shadeslayer who tried to get the tests to build\n'
p6294
aS'[13:06] <turgay> hi \n'
p6295
aS'[13:06] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: libkolab built , but tests fail\n'
p6296
aS'[13:06] <turgay> I can not get sound\n'
p6297
aS'[13:06] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so, for many packages we keep the packaging (the debian folder) in a bazaar branch https://code.launchpad.net/~kubuntu-packagers/kubuntu-packaging/\n'
p6298
aS'[13:06] <turgay> turgay@turgay-S:~$ aplay -l\n'
p6299
aS'[13:06] <turgay> aplay: device_list:252: ses kart\xc4\xb1 bulunamad\xc4\xb1...\n'
p6300
aS'[13:07] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: i am building packages listed here http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html\n'
p6301
aS"[13:07] <Riddell> I'm still not convinced that is complete\n"
p6302
aS'[13:07] <Riddell> somewhere on my todo list is to make something similar for kde packages\n'
p6303
aS'[13:07] <turgay> http://ompldr.org/vaDdjYg  lspci \n'
p6304
aS'[13:08] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: https://launchpad.net/~murthy/+archive/test/+packages\n'
p6305
aS'[13:08] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: that would be nice\n'
p6306
aS"[13:11] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so, if you want I can give you a short intro to our bzr workflow taking kile as example. Without direct commit access it takes a bit longer but you'll learn something new about launchpad too\n"
p6307
aS'[13:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: that would be awesome\n'
p6308
aS'[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: kile is in official ubuntu repos?\n'
p6309
aS'[13:12] <yofel> ok, do you have the kubuntu-dev-tools installed? That has a small script named kbzr\n'
p6310
aS'[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: checking\n'
p6311
aS'[13:12] <yofel> which helps with not having to type lp:~kubuntu-packagers/kubuntu-packaging/... all the time\n'
p6312
aS'[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no\n'
p6313
aS'[13:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: installing\n'
p6314
aS'[13:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: shall i install kubuntu-dev-tools or just kbzr just for now?\n'
p6315
aS'[13:13] <yofel> kubuntu-dev-tools, kbzr is part of that\n'
p6316
aS'[13:14] <Riddell> turgay: user support in #ubuntu and #kubuntu thanks\n'
p6317
aS"[13:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: E: Package 'kubuntu-dev-tools' has no installation candidate\n"
p6318
aS'[13:16] <yofel> add ppa:bulldog98/kubuntu-dev-tools to your sources\n'
p6319
aS'[13:16] <yofel> that has snapshots of lp:kubuntu-dev-tools \n'
p6320
aS'[13:18] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: muon has a bug, its not refreshing the list after modifying the sources , it updates after second time \n'
p6321
aS'[13:18] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: installing kubuntu-dev-tools\n'
p6322
aS"[13:18] <yofel> file a bug, but I think that's some mismatch between muon and software-properties-kde\n"
p6323
aS'[13:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6324
aS'[13:19] <turgay> Riddell: I installed kubuntu  13:04 :)\n'
p6325
aS"[13:19] <yofel> file a bug anyway so it's not forgotten\n"
p6326
aS'[13:19] <yofel> turgay: user support for 13.04 is in #ubuntu+1\n'
p6327
aS'[13:19] <turgay> ok\n'
p6328
aS"[13:19] <Riddell> turgay: #ubuntu+1 then (alas we're not sound specialists here)\n"
p6329
aS'[13:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the dev tools installed\n'
p6330
aS'[13:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: open kbzr?\n'
p6331
aS'[13:20] <yofel> ok, now go to your workplace and run: kbzr branch kile\n'
p6332
aS'[13:20] <turgay> thnx   pai.\n'
p6333
aS'[13:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have the source\n'
p6334
aS'[13:22] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: only with debian folder\n'
p6335
aS'[13:22] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: oops\n'
p6336
aS"[13:22] <yofel> right, that's all we keep in bzr\n"
p6337
aS'[13:22] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: next?\n'
p6338
aS"[13:23] <yofel> now you need to download 2.1.3 from the website as the watch file doesn't work\n"
p6339
aS'[13:23] <yofel> see http://kile.sourceforge.net/download.php\n'
p6340
aS'[13:24] <yofel> so just download the file and rename it to kile_2.1.3.orig.tar.bz2 outside the kile folder like uscan did for the other packages\n'
p6341
aS'[13:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6342
aS'[13:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: 2 min to download finish\n'
p6343
aS'[13:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: for some reason the file is getting downloaded at 26 KB/s\n'
p6344
aS'[13:27] <yofel> blame the mirror I guess\n'
p6345
aS'[13:29] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i should put the downloaded file inide kile dir or outside?\n'
p6346
aS'[13:29] <yofel> outside, and it has to be named <pkg>_<version>.orig.tar.<compression>\n'
p6347
aS'[13:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: done\n'
p6348
aS"[13:30] <yofel> the source folder would usually be kile-2.1.3, but here kile is enough as we don't need it unpacked\n"
p6349
aS'[13:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6350
aS"[13:31] <yofel> ok, now go inside the kile folder again and run 'dch -i' which'll add a new changelog entry\n"
p6351
aS"[13:31] <yofel> put 'New upstream release' there for now as usual, and change the version at the top to 2.1.3 and ubuntu1\n"
p6352
aS'[13:32] <yofel> leave it UNRELEASED\n'
p6353
aS"[13:32] <yofel> now you would usually run debuild, but with bzr you need to run 'bzr builddeb -S'\n"
p6354
aS'[13:33] <yofel> which will fail for now as I just saw\n'
p6355
aS'[13:33] <phoenix_firebrd> i have done that\n'
p6356
aS"[13:33] <yofel> as a patch doesn't apply \n"
p6357
aS"[13:36] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: ok, as we don't have the source unpacked here we can't directly work on the patch\n"
p6358
aS'[13:36] <yofel> bzr runs debuild in a temporary location so lets go there\n'
p6359
aS"[13:36] <yofel> that's ../build-area/kile-2.1.3/\n"
p6360
aS'[13:37] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, i can see the build fails, so what do we do?\n'
p6361
aS'[13:37] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p6362
aS"[13:37] <yofel> there we can work on the package as if we wouldn't be using bzr\n"
p6363
aS"[13:37] <yofel> now let me read the patch closely, as this doesn't look reverse-applied to me...\n"
p6364
aS'[13:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I am inside the said folder\n'
p6365
aS'[13:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6366
aS'[13:40] <yofel> ok, what upstream did between 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 in that file is this: http://paste.kde.org/655514 causing the patch to fail\n'
p6367
aS'[13:40] <yofel> (I found that out by pulling the 2.1.2 source from launchpad and running diff -ruN kile-2.1.{2,3}/src/data/kilestdtools.rc\n'
p6368
aS'[13:40] <yofel> )\n'
p6369
aS'[13:41] <yofel> after unpatching 2.1.2\n'
p6370
aS'[13:41] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p6371
aS'[13:41] <yofel> ok. so we need to fix the patch again, which you should now know how to do\n'
p6372
aS'[13:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: we need to create a new patch\n'
p6373
aS'[13:42] <yofel> not really, we can fix the existing one. Creating the patch fresh might be a good lesson too though\n'
p6374
aS'[13:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I sec\n'
p6375
aS'[13:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i want to take a look at the log\n'
p6376
aS'[13:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so whats the next step?\n'
p6377
aS'[13:44] <yofel> actually wait, I need to look something up\n'
p6378
aS'[13:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: shall i do what you did ?\n'
p6379
aS'[13:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6380
aS'[13:45] <yofel> we might actually want to drop that patch\n'
p6381
aS'[13:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: not needed?\n'
p6382
aS"[13:46] <yofel> that patch was added 2010 by fabo because kbibtex wasn't avaliable for KDE4\n"
p6383
aS'[13:46] <yofel> from what I see we have kbibtex 0.4 in the archive which is kde4 based\n'
p6384
aS'[13:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so we have to remove the patch and test with pbuilder\n'
p6385
aS"[13:49] <yofel> let's disable it for now\n"
p6386
aS'[13:49] <yofel> I just tried kbibtex, and while the UI is horrible, it seems usable\n'
p6387
aS'[13:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: you mean delete the patch file?\n'
p6388
aS"[13:49] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: ok, so let's go back to our bzr kile folder\n"
p6389
aS'[13:49] <yofel> no\n'
p6390
aS'[13:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6391
aS'[13:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  iam inside the bzr kile/debian\n'
p6392
aS'[13:50] <yofel> there edit debian/patches/series and comment it out (#)\n'
p6393
aS'[13:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ah right\n'
p6394
aS'[13:50] <yofel> fabo: can we just drop that?\n'
p6395
aS'[13:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: done\n'
p6396
aS'[13:51] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: next add a line in the changelog that the patch is diabled as kbibtex is now usable with kde4\n'
p6397
aS'[13:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6398
aS'[13:52] <fabo> yofel: yes\n'
p6399
aS'[13:52] <yofel> good\n'
p6400
aS'[13:53] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: ok, remove the patch name from the series file completely and bzr rm the patch\n'
p6401
aS'[13:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6402
aS'[13:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: done\n'
p6403
aS'[13:55] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: ok, now edit the control file and add kbibtex Suggests of kile (and mention that in the changelog)\n'
p6404
aS'[13:55] <yofel> *to the Suggests of kile\n'
p6405
aS'[13:56] <yofel> after that, bzr builddeb will finish fine and we can go to pbuilder\n'
p6406
aS"[13:57] <yofel> kile isn't exactly small so it'll take a while\n"
p6407
aS'[13:59] <phoenix_firebrd> lust4ever\n'
p6408
aS'[13:59] <phoenix_firebrd> oops\n'
p6409
aS"[14:00] <phoenix_firebrd> thats shouldn't have happended\n"
p6410
aS'[14:00] <phoenix_firebrd> builddeb finished successfully\n'
p6411
aS'[14:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ^\n'
p6412
aS'[14:03] <yofel> now would be the time for pbuilder, but we could skip that as it built fine here. http://paste.kde.org/655532\n'
p6413
aS'[14:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what should i do next?\n'
p6414
aS'[14:05] <yofel> ok, now\n'
p6415
aS"[14:05] <yofel> as we didn't add any new files, just run bzr commit. Debcommit should fill in the commit message with the changelog contents which is fine\n"
p6416
aS'[14:06] <yofel> so just use that\n'
p6417
aS'[14:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what will be the commit message?\n'
p6418
aS'[14:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: oops\n'
p6419
aS'[14:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sorry\n'
p6420
aS'[14:07] <yofel> if you messed up run bzr uncommit and try again\n'
p6421
aS"[14:07] <yofel> next you need to get your changes to launchpad, so run 'bzr push lp:~murthy/kubuntu-packaging/kile-2.1.3' the last part is the branch name and I just arbitrarily choose kile-2.1.3 for now\n"
p6422
aS'[14:08] <yofel> the lp: syntax is lp:<owner>/<project>/<branch<\n'
p6423
aS"[14:08] <yofel> if you don't have a project '+junk' can be used\n"
p6424
aS'[14:10] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: bzr creates a ppa ?\n'
p6425
aS'[14:10] <yofel> no\n'
p6426
aS'[14:10] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in that case i should create one or i should push to ppa:murthy/test ?\n'
p6427
aS"[14:11] <yofel> no, we don't need a package for now\n"
p6428
aS'[14:11] <yofel> we need the bzr contents on launchpad\n'
p6429
aS"[14:11] <yofel> that's what bzr push lp:~murthy/kubuntu-packaging/kile-2.1.3 will do\n"
p6430
aS'[14:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have to see the output to understand\n'
p6431
aS'[14:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: you are pushing the change to this ppa "push lp:~murthy/kubuntu-packaging/kile-2.1.3" using bzr right?\n'
p6432
aS'[14:13] <yofel> this is what I did: http://paste.kde.org/655544\n'
p6433
aS'[14:13] <yofel> that is *NOT* a PPA\n'
p6434
aS'[14:14] <phoenix_firebrd> "lp:~murthy/kubuntu-packaging/kile-2.1.3"\n'
p6435
aS'[14:14] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p6436
aS'[14:14] <yofel> the result of my push is this: https://code.launchpad.net/~yofel/kubuntu-packaging/kile-2.1.3\n'
p6437
aS'[14:14] <yofel> now you need to do it\n'
p6438
aS"[14:15] <yofel> that's just a bzr repository branch on launchpad, like on github and co.\n"
p6439
aS'[14:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok, i did that and i am getting errors\n'
p6440
aS'[14:15] <yofel> uhm, ok, what kind of?\n'
p6441
aS'[14:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/655550/\n'
p6442
aS"[14:16] <yofel> hm, then I guess you either didn't run bzr launchpad-login yet or bzr doesn't know your ssh key\n"
p6443
aS'[14:16] <yofel> the first I guess\n'
p6444
aS'[14:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya\n'
p6445
aS'[14:18] <yofel> poke me when it worked\n'
p6446
aS'[14:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6447
aS'[14:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: finished https://code.launchpad.net/~murthy/\n'
p6448
aS'[14:23] <yofel> \\o/\n'
p6449
aS'[14:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats it?\n'
p6450
aS'[14:23] <yofel> nope\n'
p6451
aS'[14:24] <phoenix_firebrd> :)\n'
p6452
aS"[14:24] <yofel> but we're close\n"
p6453
aS'[14:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: are you running out of patience?\n'
p6454
aS"[14:24] <yofel> no, just doing something else in parallel so it can't answer immediately\n"
p6455
aS'[14:25] <yofel> ok\n'
p6456
aS'[14:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no its not that, you have a lot of patience to teach me step by step\n'
p6457
aS'[14:25] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: can you please add "* New upstream release" at the top of the changelog? It\'s a bit of a redundant information but it\'s convetion to have it in there for a new version\n'
p6458
aS'[14:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I never thought that someone could do that for me\n'
p6459
aS"[14:26] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: I don't mind doing that if the other person listens to me ;)\n"
p6460
aS'[14:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok, i will add\n'
p6461
aS'[14:26] <yofel> then commit and push again\n'
p6462
aS'[14:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am all ears\n'
p6463
aS'[14:27] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all\n'
p6464
aS"[14:27] <yofel> after that we'll need to get your changes into the official packaging branch\n"
p6465
aS'[14:28] <yofel> for that, after you\'ve commited and pushed the last change, press on "Propose for merging" on the branch page\n'
p6466
aS'[14:28] <phoenix_firebrd> BluesKaj: hi\n'
p6467
aS'[14:29] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats like submitting for review? \n'
p6468
aS'[14:29] <yofel> yep\n'
p6469
aS"[14:29] <yofel> there you'll have to set the target branch, which is lp:~kubuntu-packagers/kubuntu-packaging/kile\n"
p6470
aS'[14:29] <BluesKaj> hi phoenix_firebrd\n'
p6471
aS'[14:31] <yofel> put some useful comment in there (optional), and leave the rest open for now and press Propose Merge\n'
p6472
aS'[14:31] <yofel> then give me the link to the merge\n'
p6473
aS'[14:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have updated the changelog, done builddeb, commited the changes and pushed it again\n'
p6474
aS'[14:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: 1 min\n'
p6475
aS'[14:37] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: https://code.launchpad.net/~murthy/kubuntu-packaging/kile-2.1.3/+merge/144714\n'
p6476
aS"[14:38] <yofel> good, that's the review page and launchpad will show a nice diff at the bottom once it's done loading\n"
p6477
aS'[14:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6478
aS'[14:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i can see the diff now\n'
p6479
aS"[14:41] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: ok, I'll change Adding to Add in the changelog, otherwise fine\n"
p6480
aS'[14:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: you can edit that online?\n'
p6481
aS'[14:42] <yofel> no, but bzr merge will just import your changes which I can then edit before pushing them to the real branch\n'
p6482
aS'[14:43] <shadeslayer> yofel: I think you should upload kolab\n'
p6483
aS'[14:43] <shadeslayer> because tests will take time\n'
p6484
aS'[14:43] <yofel> shadeslayer: from where?\n'
p6485
aS'[14:43] <yofel> ah, without tests\n'
p6486
aS'[14:43] <yofel> can do\n'
p6487
aS'[14:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6488
aS'[14:44] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: done https://code.launchpad.net/~kubuntu-packagers/kubuntu-packaging/kile\n'
p6489
aS'[14:44] <yofel> now\n'
p6490
aS"[14:45] <yofel> filing a merge request isn't *required*, as you can just poke me with your branch on launchpad, but I wanted you to see the full process once. Sometimes it's easier that way\n"
p6491
aS'[14:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: nice, thanks a lot\n'
p6492
aS'[14:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I will do the build process with bazaar and push it here and will poke you to merge\n'
p6493
aS"[14:47] <yofel> yeah, or someone else can do it. It's only for the packages that we have in bzr, which is the KDE SC mostly\n"
p6494
aS"[14:47] <yofel> you'll get to touch that once you're at ninja level ;)\n"
p6495
aS'[14:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  soon :)\n'
p6496
aS'[14:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I have to summarize and take notes of what i learned today\n'
p6497
aS'[14:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: that would help be if i forget something\n'
p6498
aS'[14:50] <yofel> sure, if you have a question just ask around\n'
p6499
aS'[14:50] <yofel> I added one more change, just for reference: http://paste.kde.org/655586\n'
p6500
aS"[14:50] <yofel> I should've fixed those right at the beginning\n"
p6501
aS'[14:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: should i build and put these packages http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html to bazaar branch ?\n'
p6502
aS'[14:52] <yofel> nah, only if they have a branch linked to in the control file\n'
p6503
aS'[14:52] <yofel> otherwise use the classic packaging way and put it in a PPA for review\n'
p6504
aS'[14:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6505
aS'[14:52] <yofel> for the general universe packages a MOTU will have to look at them, you can file a sponshorhip request for those (a bug)\n'
p6506
aS'[14:53] <phoenix_firebrd> MOTU?\n'
p6507
aS'[14:53] <yofel> Masters of the Universe ;P\n'
p6508
aS'[14:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats apachelogger right?\n'
p6509
aS"[14:54] <yofel> well, he's a core-dev (which implies MOTU)\n"
p6510
aS"[14:54] <yofel> more info on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Contributing and they're usually at home in #ubuntu-motu\n"
p6511
aS'[14:55] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6512
aS"[14:55] <shadeslayer> it's funny how MOTU sounds so similar to a hindi word which stands for being fat\n"
p6513
aS'[14:55] <yofel> lol\n'
p6514
aS'[14:55] <phoenix_firebrd> ha ha ha\n'
p6515
aS'[14:56] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: reason why I say that: package upload permissions are managed by package sets here, and I as kubuntu-dev can upload: http://paste.kde.org/655586\n'
p6516
aS'[14:56] <yofel> for the rest you need to find the appropriate person/team\n'
p6517
aS'[14:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i saw that when i tried to select you as a reviewer\n'
p6518
aS"[14:56] <yofel> I don't mind doing a review every now and then though. (rarely)\n"

aS"[15:03] <yofel> wow, I can't manage that ^^\n"
p6532
aS'[15:03] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: that mean your time will be around 11 pm\n'
p6533
aS'[15:03] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: do you hang around at that time?\n'
p6534
aS'[15:03] <yofel> usually yes\n'
p6535
aS'[15:04] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: if not you can try me or anyone else\n'
p6536
aS'[15:05] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: sure\n'
p6537
aS'[15:05] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: you were awake very late yesterday\n'
p6538
aS'[15:06] <Riddell> late to you is not so late to me, the americans are later still :)\n'

p6543
aS'[15:07] <yofel> ok, kile up\n'
p6544
aS'[15:07]  * yofel looks at kolab\n'
p6545
aS'[15:07] <shadeslayer> yofel: I ran dh_auto_test through xvfb-run for about 16 hours\n'
p6546
aS'[15:08] <yofel> bah\n'
p6547
aS'[15:08] <shadeslayer> but it was still stuck on the first test\n'
p6548
aS'[15:08] <yofel> yeah, it opens kompare and waits for someone to close the window\n'
p6549
aS"[15:08] <shadeslayer> so we should ask the kolab people if it's possible to keep running the tests even if the kompare window is open\n"
p6550
aS'[15:08] <shadeslayer> and not fail if the kompare window is not closed\n'
p6551
aS'[15:09] <yofel> yeah, or if they could make it not use kompare\n'
p6552
aS'[15:09] <shadeslayer> I read the code a bit\n'
p6553
aS"[15:09] <shadeslayer> I couldn't figure out why it would open kompare\n"
p6554
aS"[15:09] <shadeslayer> because it's a macro\n"
p6555
aS"[15:09] <shadeslayer> which doesn't have a kompare call\n"
p6556
aS'[15:10] <shadeslayer> so will talk to the kolab people\n'
p6557
aS'[15:10] <yofel> ...\n'
p6558
aS'[15:10] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: feel free to, good night\n'

p6628
aS"[15:25] <apachelogger> well, I don't see what needs explaining anyway ^^\n"
p6629
aS'[15:26] <apachelogger> imagine you have the variables FILES and DIRS from which targets are built\n'
p6630
aS'[15:27] <apachelogger> so what happens is that make creates a target with the unique name of each file by copying the generic target, and otherwise subs FILES for the actual names\n'
p6631

aS'[01:43] <shadeslayer> and finally someone I can say morning to at a sane time\n'
p6758
aS'[01:43] <phoenix_firebrd> did you succeed with the libkolab tests?\n'
p6759
aS'[01:43] <phoenix_firebrd> :)\n'
p6760
aS'[01:44] <shadeslayer> somewhat\n'
p6761
aS'[01:44] <shadeslayer> as yofel mentioned, the tests open kompare\n'
p6762
aS'[01:44] <shadeslayer> and tried to make kompare quit using a couple of methods\n'
p6763
aS'[01:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so the developers thought we should be building the source without the pbuilder?\n'
p6764
aS'[01:45] <shadeslayer> dbus, kquitapp ( which is basically just another wrapper over dbus for KDE apps ), using kill `pidof kompare` .... nothing worked\n'
p6765
aS'[01:46] <shadeslayer> I even tried extracting the dbus address from /proc/pid_of_komare/environ\n'
p6766
aS"[01:46] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: usually tests don't wait for an app to be closed\n"
p6767
aS"[01:47] <shadeslayer> it's not unusal to have tests that require X running\n"
p6768
aS"[01:47] <shadeslayer> but it's unusual to open an app and keep waiting for it to be closed\n"
p6769
aS'[01:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: why is this written pbuilder unfriendly \n'
p6770
aS'[01:48] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: because pbuilder is just a packaging tool used by packagers\n'
p6771
aS'[01:48] <shadeslayer> it holds no significance when writing code :)\n'
p6772
aS'[01:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i know but the devs know that we will be testing with pbuilder right?\n'
p6773
aS'[01:49] <shadeslayer> nope\n'
p6774
aS'[01:49] <BarkingFish> hi again.\n'
p6775
aS'[01:49] <shadeslayer> pbuilder is just a packaging tool\n'
p6776
aS'[01:49] <shadeslayer> hey BarkingFish\n'
p6777
aS'[01:49] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so this is why Riddell is not using pbuilder\n'

aS'[01:49] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: to each his own :)\n'
p6779
aS'[01:49] <BarkingFish> hi shadeslayer :)\n'
p6780
aS'[01:49] <phoenix_firebrd> BarkingFish: got the log?\n'
p6781
aS'[01:49] <shadeslayer> you can use sbuild or whatever\n'
p6782
aS'[01:50] <shadeslayer> pbuilder is just the de facto standard in Ubuntu land for build packages\n'
p6783
aS'[01:50] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the testing would be easy if i use a vm with a full install right?\n'
p6784
aS'[01:50] <shadeslayer> not really\n'
p6785
aS"[01:50] <BarkingFish> the error, phoenix_firebrd  - i forgot and did it in a tty, so couldn't copy / paste\n"
p6786
aS'[01:51] <phoenix_firebrd> BarkingFish: ok\n'
p6787
aS'[01:51] <shadeslayer> you could just add your ppa, install the kolab stuff, try it out and remove the PPA\n'
p6788
aS"[01:51] <shadeslayer> that's what I usually do\n"
p6789
aS"[01:51] <BarkingFish> the upshot is, i can't install manually, because apparently it can't find KBUILD - it needs me to supply the path to KBUILD when i try to manually make ndiswrapper.\n"

aS'[01:51] <BarkingFish> and i forgot entirely how the hell to get dkms to do anything :)\n'

aS'[01:52] <shadeslayer> then setup a VM\n'
p6794
aS'[01:52] <shadeslayer> though you could just use a pbuilder for that too\n'
p6795
aS"[01:52] <shadeslayer> unless it's a graphical app, in which case it's better to do it in a VM\n"
p6796
aS'[01:54] <shadeslayer> see pbuilders --login option\n'
p6797
aS'[01:54] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: is there a way to take a snapshot of the base image of pbuilder?\n'
p6798
aS'[01:54] <shadeslayer> huh?\n'
p6799
aS'[01:54] <shadeslayer> snapshot?\n'
p6800
aS'[01:54] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i saw that already\n'
p6801
aS'[01:55] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya if i use save after login, it will update the base image , but if i want to have the dfault base, i have to create it again right?\n'
p6802
aS"[01:56] <shadeslayer> then don't use --save-after-login?\n"
p6803
aS'[01:56] <shadeslayer> just do a --login\n'
p6804
aS"[01:56] <shadeslayer> and the changes won't be saved\n"
p6805
aS'[01:56] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: if i want some packages to be installed before the pbuilder starts building\n'
p6806
aS'[01:57] <phoenix_firebrd> ?\n'
p6807
aS'[01:57] <shadeslayer> can you give me a usecase?\n'
p6808
aS'[01:57] <shadeslayer> as to why you would want to do that? I can advise better that way\n'
p6809
aS'[01:57] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: example i want dbus and dbus-x11 to be installed\n'
p6810
aS'[01:58] <shadeslayer> why?\n'
p6811
aS'[01:58] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  in case an app needs as a requirement \n'
p6812
aS'[01:58] <shadeslayer> then you add it to Build-Depends\n'
p6813
aS'[01:59] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: no not as a dep , but for some other purpose\n'
p6814
aS"[01:59] <shadeslayer> define 'other purpose'\n"
p6815
aS'[01:59] <shadeslayer> for eg. I added xvfb and other stuff to Build-Depends for libkolab tests\n'
p6816
aS"[02:00] <shadeslayer> even though it's not required to compile libkolab, it's required to run the tests\n"
p6817
aS'[02:00] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: tell me how can i install something before pbuilder starts \n'
p6818
aS"[02:00] <shadeslayer> I still don't see why you'd want to do that :P\n"
p6819
aS'[02:01] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: tell me\n'
p6820
aS"[02:01] <shadeslayer> because let's say you do it, that change will be local, and when you upload it to Launchpad, the build will fail\n"
p6821
aS"[02:01] <shadeslayer> because it doesn't have that dep installed\n"
p6822
aS'[02:01] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: well .. you could write a hook, or install it by hand and use --save-after-login\n'
p6823
aS'[02:02] <phoenix_firebrd> i min\n'
p6824
aS'[02:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: sorry i was on the phone\n'
p6825
aS'[02:08] <shadeslayer> np\n'
p6826
aS"[02:08] <shadeslayer> I'm about to leave though, in another 10 minutes or so\n"
p6827
aS'[02:09] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: what you say is right and i know that too, but i want to know how to do that\n'
p6828
aS'[02:09] <shadeslayer> ok, like I said, 2 ways\n'
p6829
aS'[02:09] <shadeslayer> one way keeps the chroot clean\n'
p6830
aS'[02:09] <shadeslayer> the other is quicker\n'
p6831
aS"[02:09] <BarkingFish> i'm going to be going soon, but if anyone can help me with the dkms thing, your assistance would be appreciated. \n"
p6832
aS'[02:10] <shadeslayer> BarkingFish: tried #ubuntu-x ?\n'
p6833
aS"[02:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: we can't login to the env when pbuilder running?\n"
p6834
aS'[02:10] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: sure you can\n'
p6835
aS'[02:10] <BarkingFish> I want to run raring with what it came with - not pollute it by having to use an old kernel, so i need to either get dkms to build ndiswrapper, or be able to build it manually.\n'
p6836
aS"[02:10] <BarkingFish> shadeslayer, no, i didn't even know it existed\n"
p6837
aS'[02:10] <BarkingFish> :)\n'
p6838
aS'[02:11] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p6839
aS'[02:11] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: sec\n'
p6840
aS'[02:11] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/Ninjas/BuildEnvironment\n'
p6841
aS'[02:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so there is not way of running or installing an app expect to add to deps\n'
p6842
aS"[02:11] <BarkingFish> that's for xorg apparently\n"
p6843
aS'[02:11] <shadeslayer> read the section on Pbuilder Hooks\n'
p6844
aS"[02:11] <BarkingFish> this isn't anything to do with xorg from what I can see :)\n"
p6845
aS"[02:11] <shadeslayer> BarkingFish: but isn't DKMS related to X ?\n"
p6846
aS'[02:11] <shadeslayer> oh\n'
p6847
aS'[02:12] <shadeslayer> dunno then, sorry\n'
p6848
aS"[02:12] <shadeslayer> there's also #ubuntu-kernel\n"
p6849
aS'[02:12] <shadeslayer> so *maybe* that helps?\n'
p6850
aS'[02:12] <BarkingFish> aha\n'
p6851
aS'[02:12] <BarkingFish> you bet it does\n'
p6852
aS'[02:12] <shadeslayer> awesome\n'
p6853
aS"[02:13] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: I don't follow your question\n"
p6854
aS'[02:13] <shadeslayer> when you install an app, it should pull in everything it requires\n'
p6855
aS"[02:13] <shadeslayer> there's a Depends field explicitly for that\n"
p6856
aS'[02:14] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: tell me how can i install dbus and dbus-x11 before pbuilder starts testing apart from adding it to deps and and with out using the save after login option\n'
p6857
aS'[02:15] <shadeslayer> write a hook\n'
p6858
aS'[02:15] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thats nice\n'
p6859
aS'[02:15] <shadeslayer> see the wiki page I just sent you a couple of lines back\n'
p6860
aS'[02:15] <shadeslayer> and note the hook names\n'
p6861
aS'[02:16] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i am reading that\n'
p6862
aS"[02:16] <shadeslayer> the hook names signify at what point in the build they're run\n"
p6863
aS'[02:17] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so you wrote a hook to kill kompare?\n'
p6864
aS'[02:17] <shadeslayer> no\n'
p6865
aS'[02:17] <shadeslayer> writing a hook is not feasible for that because that hook is not there in the build\n'
p6866
aS'[02:17] <shadeslayer> so I tried killing it via debian/rules\n'
p6867
aS'[02:17] <shadeslayer> note that hooks are only local\n'
p6868
aS'[02:18] <shadeslayer> the buildd has no hooks / extra packages installed\n'
p6869
aS'[02:18] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya, i am asking it purely for local purposes only \n'
p6870
aS'[02:18] <shadeslayer> it will only read debian/control and install the packages it reads from the Build-Dep line\n'
p6871
aS'[02:18] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: for testing my things \n'
p6872
aS'[02:18] <shadeslayer> okay\n'
p6873
aS'[02:18] <shadeslayer> anyway, gtg\n'
p6874
aS'[02:18] <shadeslayer> cya\n'
p6875
aS'[02:19] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: bye\n'
p6876
aS'[07:25] <jussi> Morning ladies and gents\n'
p6877
aS'[07:56] <highvoltage> hello jussi\n'
p6878
aS'[07:57] <jussi> gday highvoltage!\n'
p6879
aS'[07:59] <jussi> highvoltage: hows things? been a while since we talked...\n'
p6880
aS'[08:00] <highvoltage> jussi: oh well\n'
p6881
aS'[08:01] <highvoltage> jussi: been tough but I have a feeling everything is going to be ok\n'
p6882
aS'[08:01] <highvoltage> jussi: and you?\n'
p6883
aS'[08:01] <jussi> highvoltage: yeah, doing ok, kid growing, work going ok.\n'
p6884
aS"[08:41] <yofel_> phoenix_firebrd: hi, as shadeslayer said, installing packages by hooks is usually not recommended as it's purely local, but look at the B20icecc hook as an example\n"
p6885
aS"[08:41] <yofel_> as those packages only make sense locally they're installed by hook\n"
p6886
aS'=== yofel_ is now known as yofel\n'
p6887
aS'[08:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel_: ya i know, but its like the "goto"\n'
p6888
aS'[08:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: for local personal testing purposes\n'
p6889
aS'[08:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have some doubts on using amazon ec2\n'
p6890
aS"[08:42] <yofel> sure, it's just that you should usually keep your setup as clean as possible to use different pbuilder images\n"
p6891
aS'[08:42] <yofel> I have a couple of quantal images with different setup for example\n'
p6892
aS"[08:43] <yofel> (different sets of PPA's added etc.)\n"
p6893
aS'[08:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6894
aS'[08:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: how much does it cost the community if i use the cloud for an hour?\n'
p6895
aS"[08:44] <yofel> you'll have to ask Riddell what kind of ec2 instance he's using and then look up the prices\n"
p6896
aS"[08:44] <yofel> it's usually not that much though, and a higher productivity is usually woth it\n"
p6897
aS'[08:45] <yofel> *worth\n'
p6898
aS'[08:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  i am using it past 3 hrs and i am worried about the cost\n'
p6899
aS'[08:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: building fast-md5 now\n'
p6900
aS'[08:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: working with the ec2 is bliss except the char echo speed is slow because of my show internet  connection\n'
p6901
aS'[08:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: probably with a 400 ms delay\n'
p6902
aS"[08:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: well, the pricing is here: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ but I don't know where the instance is nor what kind\n"
p6903
aS'[08:51] <yofel> meh, they still only accept credit cards :(\n'
p6904
aS'[08:55] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this one is a partial log http://paste.kde.org/656090/\n'
p6905
aS'[08:55] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: fast-md5 build fails\n'
p6906
aS'[08:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: from the log the resulting output is a jar\n'
p6907
aS'[09:00] <yofel> the new build.xml has no jar target, so the error is right\n'
p6908
aS"[09:00] <yofel> I know 0 about ant so can't really help here\n"
p6909
aS'[09:01] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok i will drop this build process and exit the ec2 session\n'
p6910
aS"[09:02] <yofel> make sure to power it down if you know that you don't need it anymore\n"
p6911
aS'[09:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: dont it affect someone else?\n'
p6912
aS"[09:02] <yofel> I don't think those sessions are shared, you'll have to ask Riddell though\n"
p6913
aS'[09:03] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: yesterday he asked me if he can shutdown , i am confused\n'
p6914
aS'[09:04] <yofel> uhm, they charge by runtime, so he was wondering whether you were still using it before he shuts it down\n'
p6915
aS'[09:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so can i shutdown  now?\n'
p6916
aS"[09:04] <yofel> let's wait for him if you're not sure\n"
p6917
aS'[09:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in that case i will just exit the session\n'
p6918
aS'[09:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: did you review the packages in my ppa?\n'
p6919
aS'[09:06] <yofel> I did for kolab\n'
p6920
aS'[09:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I am planning to remove the ssh and gpg keys, will that affect the packages in the ppa?\n'
p6921
aS"[09:07] <yofel> I'm not familiar with the others so it'll have to wait till the evening if you want *me* to review them\n"
p6922
aS"[09:07] <yofel> I can't upload them anyway\n"
p6923
aS'[09:07] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: nope, only new uploads/commits\n'
p6924
aS'[09:08] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so removing the present ssh and gpg keys from launchapd and from my local doesnot affect the packages in the ppa  correct?\n'
p6925
aS"[09:11] <yofel> whatever is already on launchpad isn't affected. The keys are only used to identify you to launchpad from outside of the WebUI\n"
p6926
aS"[09:12] <yofel> the ppa has it's own signature key for the binary packages\n"
p6927
aS'[09:12] <yofel> *its\n'
p6928
aS'[09:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6929
aS'[09:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can you recommend some packages that needs priority from here http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html\n'
p6930
aS"[09:18] <yofel> hm, I don't recognise pretty much all packages on that list, so there isn't really anything from us left\n"
p6931
aS'[09:18] <yofel> at least nothing with a working watch file\n'
p6932
aS'[09:18] <yofel> (someone remind me to fix the one in kile)\n'
p6933
aS'[09:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i will remind you.\n'
p6934
aS"[09:20] <yofel> let's see if mom has something\n"
p6935
aS'[09:20] <yofel> https://merges.ubuntu.com/\n'
p6936
aS'[09:20] <yofel> (universe.html)\n'
p6937
aS'[09:21] <yofel> Riddell: is koffice-l10n still used by something?\n'
p6938
aS'[09:22] <yofel> shadeslayer: go merge quassel ;)\n'
p6939
aS'[09:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: is that the merge request dashboard ?\n'
p6940
aS"[09:23] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: it's the auto-generated list of packages that could be merged with newer versions from debian\n"
p6941
aS'[09:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so i should pick from here\n'
p6942
aS"[09:24] <yofel> well, I'm not a merge expert, or at least not an expert at teaching it, and quassel seems to be the only thing from our packageset in there\n"
p6943
aS"[09:24] <yofel> let's see if it's worth i\n"
p6944
aS'[09:24] <yofel> *it\n'
p6945
aS'[09:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok , shall i try?\n'
p6946
aS"[09:30] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: doesn't look like it's really worth it on first glance, but feel free to\n"
p6947
aS"[09:30] <yofel> I couldn't find the classic merge guide, the udd one is here and usually works too: http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/udd-merging.html\n"
p6948
aS'[09:31] <yofel> just use debianlp:sid/quassel as debian branch\n'
p6949
aS'[09:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p6950
aS'[09:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i can do this later?\n'
p6951
aS"[09:32] <yofel> there's not a lot to merge here, so it should be not too hard\n"
p6952
aS'[09:32] <yofel> sure\n'
p6953
aS"[09:33] <yofel> if you won't do it it'll probably be forgotten for a while\n"
p6954
aS'[09:33] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: why?\n'
p6955
aS'[09:33] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: one thing though. If you do start on it, mention that in the (invisible) comment field on https://merges.ubuntu.com/universe.html\n'
p6956
aS"[09:34] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: the debian package doesn't really add anything except some maintenance changes compared to our package\n"
p6957
aS'[09:34] <yofel> so usually nothing I would spend my time on. But good as an example\n'
p6958
aS'[09:34] <yofel> (good as an example that actually yields something useful)\n'
p6959
aS'[09:35] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i will try this with the help of you or someelse\n'
p6960
aS'[09:35] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am new to this\n'
p6961
aS"[09:37] <yofel> sure. Once you did the merge you've seen most of our packaging activities I think. Except for packaging something from scratch\n"
p6962
aS'[09:37] <yofel> not sure if we have something in the queue for that\n'
p6963
aS'[09:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have done packaging from scratch , like the the nepomuk metadata extractor\n'
p6964
aS'[09:38] <yofel> ah good\n'
p6965
aS'[09:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: which reminds me about the python optimization, did you do it? \n'
p6966
aS"[09:40] <yofel> no, better look for someone else as that looks time consuming from what I've seen and I don't have that much spare time currently\n"
p6967
aS'[09:41] <yofel> (or at least am not motivated enough to spend a few days on that)\n'
p6968
aS'[09:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok, the python thing takes 1h 10 min for compiling the ontologies , thats not good right?\n'
p6969
aS'[09:43] <yofel> I tried it, I know, took half an hour even on my i7\n'
p6970
aS'[09:44] <phoenix_firebrd> brb\n'
p6971
aS'[09:51] <phoenix_firebrd> going to building simple-http\n'
p6972
aS'[09:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what happended to libkolabxml?\n'
p6973
aS'[09:58] <phoenix_firebrd> ah its merged\n'
p6974
aS"[10:00] <allee> afiestas: debian pkgers asked: what's the mininal version of  kdelibs, kdeworkspace that required for (lib)kscreen?  \n"
p6975
aS'[10:01] <yofel> allee: CMakeLists.txt should tell you that\n'
p6976
aS"[10:02] <yofel> but doesn't yay\n"
p6977
aS"[10:02] <yofel> allee: I don't think we've tried to build it with anything older than 4.9\n"
p6978
aS"[10:03] <yofel> allee: kdeworkspace doesn't seem to be needed though\n"
p6979
aS'[10:19] <yofel> afiestas: about kscreen: <pinotree> why does it require qjson 0.8?\n'
p6980
aS'[10:29] <afiestas> allee: no idea tbh\n'
p6981
aS'[10:29] <afiestas> but anything 4.9 and greater works\n'
p6982
aS'[10:30] <afiestas> should work in 4.8 as well I guess\n'
p6983
aS'[10:30] <afiestas> but only 49 and above is supported\n'
p6984
aS'[10:30] <afiestas> yofel: because it does? :33\n'
p6985
aS'[10:30] <afiestas> qjson 0.7.1 is not able to properly serialize floats\n'
p6986
aS'[10:30] <yofel> ah ok\n'
p6987
aS'[10:30] <afiestas> tbh, getting tired of having to asnwer these questions :s\n'
p6988
aS'[10:31] <afiestas> I mean, it is like the 5th time I do, maybe I should document it somewhere\n'
p6989
aS'[10:31] <yofel> heh\n'
p6990
aS"[10:31] <allee> afiestas: can't be wrong :-)\n"
p6991
aS'[10:39] <vassie> Riddell: Hello, new package uploaded ;)\n'

aS'[11:23] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: a basic ec2 machine costs 8.5UScents an hour\n'

aS'[11:26] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: is that hi or low?\n'
p6996
aS"[11:27] <Riddell> it's cheap for an hour, it's expensive to leave it on for a year\n"
p6997
aS'[11:28] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: should i shutdown after finishing my work or just exit the session?\n'
p6998
aS'[11:28] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: yes you should terminate it with "poweroff"\n'
p6999
aS'[11:29] <Riddell> or by telling me\n'
p7000
aS'[11:29] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: will it affect anyone else\n'
p7001
aS'[11:36] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: shutting down a machine?  depends if anyone else is using the machine\n'
p7002
aS"[11:36] <Riddell> they're not usuall shared, the whole point is it's a quick way to get an isolated environment\n"

p7033
aS"[13:25] <Riddell> that's quite an upgrade!\n"
p7034
aS'[13:25] <basse> and it all just worked :)  ok. well, lost wireless for a bit, but that was just wrong drivers and easy fix.  and on the process, got 40gigs more space on my harddrive, which is kind of strange. but i like it :)\n'
p7035

p7208
aS'[00:28] <BarkingFish> thanks\n'

aS"[00:47] <BarkingFish> ok, well i'm subscribing to that now - i'll keep watch there\n"
p7227
aS'[01:16]  * BarkingFish happy happy happy happy happy happy happy :D\n'
p7228
aS"[01:16] <BarkingFish> I don't need ndiswrapper anymore.  \n"
p7229
aS'[01:17] <BarkingFish> As of kernel 3.8.0-2-generic, there is now an ar5523 module\n'
p7230
aS'[01:18]  * BarkingFish bounces up and down like a roo on a pogo stick\n'
p7231
aS'[01:31] <apachelogger> hooray for free drivers\n'
p7232
aS"[01:35] <BarkingFish> apachelogger, you bet.  I've been using ndiswrapper for almost 8 years, and finally a working ar552 driver pops up.  I can't deny i'll miss ndiswrapper's little foibles and general pain in the arse-ness, but this is about the best day since I dropped windows 11 years ago.\n"
p7233
aS'[01:35] <BarkingFish> *ar5523\n'
p7234
aS"[01:36] <BarkingFish> especially since ndiswrapper's dkms module wouldn't build on 3.8.0-2 - this sorta turned up at the right time\n"

aS"[01:49] <BarkingFish> night guys, i'm out to get some sleep :) 2.50am here :P\n"

aS"[03:31] <shadeslayer> Riddell: it seems that rbelem didn't add the description and I didn't double check\n"
p7237
aS'[09:21] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: need to use ec2\n'
p7238
aS'=== yofel_ is now known as yofel\n'
p7239
aS'[11:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: are you there?\n'
p7240
aS'[11:42] <yofel> more or less yes\n'
p7241
aS'[11:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: do you have access to the ec2?\n'
p7242
aS'[11:43] <yofel> no\n'
p7243
aS'[11:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p7244
aS'[11:44] <yofel> if anything I can get you an account on my server, has reasonable amount of bandwidth, but your sudo permissions would be limited to pbuilder\n'
p7245
aS'[11:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i think Riddell has added a wrong key of mine and i am denied access\n'
p7246
aS'[11:45] <yofel> is it even running?\n'
p7247
aS'[11:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: not sure\n'
p7248
aS'[11:45] <yofel> probably not then\n'
p7249
aS'[11:45] <yofel> pm\n'
p7250
aS'[11:45] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: when did you request the instance?\n'
p7251
aS'[11:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: if it is not running then how come it can give a key fingerprint\n'
p7252
aS'[11:46] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: hi\n'
p7253
aS'[11:46] <shadeslayer> hey :)\n'
p7254
aS'[11:46] <shadeslayer> yofel: huzzah, PA3 is up\n'
p7255
aS'[11:46] <shadeslayer> almost all of it\n'
p7256
aS'[11:46] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: Riddell gave me naturally as you mentioned\n'
p7257
aS"[11:46] <yofel> hm, dunno, I don't know much about ec2\n"
p7258
aS'[11:46] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: no, I mean *when*\n'
p7259
aS'[11:46] <shadeslayer> not to mention\n'
p7260
aS'[11:46] <yofel> shadeslayer: \\o/\n'
p7261
aS'[11:46] <shadeslayer> since the IP addresses are shared\n'
p7262
aS'[11:46] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: 2 days back\n'
p7263
aS'[11:47] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: probably shut down then\n'
p7264
aS"[11:47] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: it's basically use and throw instances\n"
p7265
aS"[11:47] <shadeslayer> once you're done, you shut them down and someone can spin a new instance and it might get the same address\n"
p7266
aS'[11:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: I have asked Riddell to add my key and i have 2 keys in launchpad, i think he might have added the wrong one\n'
p7267
aS'[11:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\n'
p7268
aS"[11:48] <shadeslayer> which is why you get a fingerprint on your konsole, but the fingerprint is different since it's a new instance\n"
p7269
aS'[11:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\n'
p7270
aS'[11:48] <shadeslayer> with a different ssh instance\n'
p7271
aS'[11:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok now understand\n'
p7272
aS'[11:48] <shadeslayer> :)\n'
p7273
aS'[11:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: So we should request Riddell everytime need one\n'
p7274
aS'[11:49] <shadeslayer> more or less\n'
p7275
aS"[11:49] <shadeslayer> and shut it down once you're done\n"
p7276
aS'[11:49] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: it was a blizz working with a 40 mbps connection\n'
p7277
aS'[11:49] <shadeslayer> :D\n'
p7278
aS'[11:49] <shadeslayer> one other way to speed up builds is by doing in memory builds\n'
p7279
aS'[11:50] <shadeslayer> but then you need alot of RAM for that\n'
p7280
aS'[11:50] <yofel> talking abou thtat\n'
p7281
aS'[11:50] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: only thing that is bad for me is i have a 400ms delay in char echo\n'
p7282
aS'[11:50] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p7283
aS'[11:50] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: mosh ftw\n'
p7284
aS"[11:50] <yofel> shadeslayer: any idea why eatmydata wouldn't work?\n"
p7285
aS'[11:51] <phoenix_firebrd> ya\n'
p7286
aS'[11:51] <phoenix_firebrd> i am getting my log filled by it\n'
p7287
aS'[11:51] <shadeslayer> yofel: no idea\n'
p7288
aS"[11:51] <yofel> I tried to make phoenix_firebrd enable it, but it only kept throwing errors that the so isn't there, even though it seemed installed (from what he said)\n"
p7289
aS'[11:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: need the log?\n'
p7290
aS'[11:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its just this "ERROR: ld.so: object \'/usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so\' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored."\n'
p7291
aS"[11:52] <shadeslayer> yofel: did you try making sure LD_PRELOAD had the lib in it's path\n"
p7292
aS'[11:52] <yofel> not really\n'
p7293
aS'[11:52] <shadeslayer> hm\n'
p7294
aS'[11:52] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i checked it and it was in the patch\n'
p7295
aS"[11:52] <yofel> shadeslayer: if works fine for me, that's why I'm confused\n"
p7296
aS'[11:52] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: and ldd loads it without a problem\n'
p7297
aS'[11:52] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: in the path *inside* pbuilder, right?\n'
p7298
aS'[11:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, we checked together, you forgot\n'
p7299
aS'[11:53] <yofel> no, just wanted to double check\n'
p7300
aS"[11:53] <yofel> as this doesn't make sense\n"
p7301
aS'[11:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: let me check it one more time\n'
p7302
aS'[11:55] <phoenix_firebrd>  the lib is in its path and it ldd shows no problem\n'
p7303
aS'[11:57] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: how do i replace the default editor used by quilt, i put "EDITOR=kate" in quilltrc. thats not working\n'
p7304
aS'[11:57] <yofel> what would quilt need an editor for?\n'
p7305
aS'[11:57] <shadeslayer> quilt edit ?\n'
p7306
aS'[11:57] <yofel> never used that\n'
p7307
aS'[11:58] <shadeslayer> heh okay\n'
p7308
aS'[11:58] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: try putting : export EDITOR=kate : in bashrc\n'
p7309
aS'[11:58] <yofel> ^\n'
p7310
aS'[11:58] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\n'
p7311
aS'[11:58] <phoenix_firebrd> i will try\n'
p7312
aS'[12:01] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: works\n'
p7313
aS'[12:01] <shadeslayer> awesome\n'
p7314
aS'[12:03] <phoenix_firebrd> i can see probably in some debian/patches files the original file is in source.orig dir and the new file is in the source dir why is this?\n'
p7315
aS'[12:03] <shadeslayer> I usually setup quilt by following : http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/modify.en.html\n'
p7316
aS'[12:04] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: patch strips out the first part of the path when used with -p1\n'
p7317
aS'[12:04] <yofel> same here, except a few things removed that pinotree said were nonsense\n'
p7318
aS'[12:04] <shadeslayer> yofel: oh? like?\n'
p7319
aS'[12:05] <yofel> --no-index\n'
p7320
aS'[12:05] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: have a read through the -pnum option in the patch man page\n'
p7321
aS"[12:05] <yofel> that was like ages ago though so don't ask me for the reasoning\n"
p7322
aS'[12:05] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p7323
aS'[12:07] <phoenix_firebrd> I am not able to understand what you said, i will post the original patch and the new patch created by me take a look at it\n'
p7324
aS'[12:08] <phoenix_firebrd> this is the old one -->http://paste.kde.org/657410/\n'
p7325
aS'[12:08] <phoenix_firebrd> this is the new one created my me -> http://paste.kde.org/657422/\n'
p7326
aS'[12:09] <shadeslayer> looks the same\n'
p7327
aS'[12:09] <shadeslayer> except it adds an index\n'
p7328
aS'[12:09] <yofel> because he has my quiltrc\n'
p7329
aS'[12:09] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p7330
aS'[12:09] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: look at the new and original file locations\n'
p7331
aS'[12:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: in the original patch\n'
p7332
aS'[12:10] <yofel> same?\n'
p7333
aS'[12:10] <shadeslayer> ^\n'
p7334
aS'[12:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: sorry\n'
p7335
aS'[12:11] <phoenix_firebrd> i added the wtrong one as original file\n'
p7336
aS'[12:11] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: or did you mean something like this: http://paste.kde.org/657428 ?\n'
p7337
aS'[12:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: exactly\n'
p7338
aS'[12:12] <yofel> what\'s what you get if you don\'t use "-p ab" in quilt diff\n'
p7339
aS'[12:12] <yofel> and your quiltrc sets that\n'
p7340
aS"[12:12] <yofel> *that's\n"
p7341
aS"[12:13] <shadeslayer> yofel: he's talking about the path stripping stuff right?\n"
p7342
aS'[12:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: when i uupdate, the default patch files are like this\n'
p7343
aS'[12:13] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya\n'
p7344
aS'[12:14] <phoenix_firebrd> why fuzz is not allowed patching?\n'
p7345
aS"[12:14] <yofel> well, it's the default setting to have it with .orig\n"
p7346
aS'[12:14] <yofel> not sure why uupdate would use that though\n'
p7347
aS'[12:15] <yofel> not sure, from man 1 dpkg-source:\n'
p7348
aS"[12:15] <yofel>        Contrary  to  quilt's default behaviour, patches are expected to apply without any fuzz. When that is not the case, you should refresh such patches with\n"
p7349
aS'[12:15] <yofel>        quilt, or dpkg-source will error out while trying to apply them\n'
p7350
aS'[12:16] <shadeslayer> oh fun, that explains why builds fail when there is fuzz\n'
p7351
aS"[12:16] <yofel> wait, you didn't know that? :D\n"
p7352
aS"[12:16] <shadeslayer> let's just say I didn't realize that it was documented behavior\n"
p7353
aS'[12:16] <yofel> heh\n'
p7354
aS'[12:16] <shadeslayer> I thought it was some sort of feature that was missing\n'
p7355
aS'[12:17] <yofel> I think it did change at some point\n'
p7356
aS'[12:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: here is a build log of texi2html http://paste.kde.org/657434/     do you see anything odd or everything is ok\n'
p7357
aS'[12:17] <yofel> as it did with dpkg-source not auto-committing manual changes anymore\n'
p7358
aS'[12:18] <yofel> *blink*\n'
p7359
aS"[12:18] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: ok, I think I know what's causing *those* LD errors\n"
p7360
aS'[12:18] <yofel> is eatmydata installed in your regular system?\n'
p7361
aS'[12:18] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: let me check\n'
p7362
aS'[12:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no\n'
p7363
aS'[12:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: install?\n'
p7364
aS"[12:19] <yofel> yeah, that'll probably help\n"
p7365
aS'[12:19] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p7366
aS'[12:19] <yofel> as the pbuilder scripts need to run a few commands on the host system (like ln for the debs)\n'
p7367
aS'[12:20] <shadeslayer> "Need to get 969 MB/1,088 MB of archives."\n'
p7368
aS'[12:20] <shadeslayer> :(\n'
p7369
aS'[12:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: should i update pbuilder?\n'
p7370
aS'[12:20] <yofel> nope\n'
p7371
aS'[12:20] <yofel> shadeslayer: upgrading? ^^\n'
p7372
aS'[12:21] <shadeslayer> yeah\n'
p7373
aS'[12:21] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: I am needing the ec2 for the same purpose\n'
p7374
aS'[12:21] <shadeslayer> upgrading after a long time\n'
p7375
aS'[12:21] <shadeslayer> about 10-15 days\n'
p7376
aS"[12:21] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: actually I'm upgrading my system :P\n"
p7377
aS'[12:21] <shadeslayer> not pbuilder\n'
p7378
aS"[12:21] <yofel> oh, now that's a lot then...\n"
p7379
aS'[12:21] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p7380
aS"[12:22] <shadeslayer> didn't even upgrade KDE\n"
p7381
aS'[12:22] <shadeslayer> so most of it is that\n'
p7382
aS'[12:22] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: some of the apps need some java stuff pre installed before building in the system\n'
p7383
aS'[12:22] <shadeslayer> wot\n'
p7384
aS"[12:22] <yofel> if you build jar's you will need java...\n"
p7385
aS'[12:22] <shadeslayer> anyway, have to go, ciao\n'
p7386
aS'[12:22] <shadeslayer> yofel: but he said pre-installed\n'
p7387
aS'[12:23] <phoenix_firebrd> no somethink called maven-repo-buildhelper\n'
p7388
aS'[12:23] <shadeslayer> yofel: and by pre-installed I infer before dpkg installs build-dep\n'
p7389
aS'[12:23] <shadeslayer> *build-deps\n'
p7390
aS'[12:23] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: ^ ?\n'
p7391
aS'[12:23] <phoenix_firebrd> ya\n'
p7392
aS'[12:23] <yofel> odd\n'
p7393
aS"[12:23] <yofel> if maven needs it then it's supposed to pre-depend on java\n"
p7394
aS'[12:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its simple-http\n'
p7395
aS'[12:24] <shadeslayer> Pre-Depends ... heh\n'
p7396
aS"[12:24] <yofel> doesn't matter, maven is a build system for java, ofcourse it would need java to work\n"
p7397
aS'[12:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this is the package maven_repo_helper\n'
p7398
aS"[12:25] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: what's the problem exactly\n"
p7399
aS'[12:25] <yofel> maven-repo-helper does depend on default-jre-headless, does it fail to install?\n'
p7400
aS'[12:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: my slow internet connection\n'
p7401
aS'[12:26] <yofel> ok\n'
p7402
aS'[12:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: then i tried to login to ec2 and failed and i halted building it now\n'
p7403
aS'[12:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the error stop\n'
p7404
aS'[12:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: it worked\n'
p7405
aS'[12:29] <yofel> good, I forgot about that possibility :/\n'
p7406
aS'[12:29] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what does fsync do and by not using that what does get affected?\n'
p7407
aS'[12:29] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what does fsync do and by not using that what does get affected?\n'
p7408
aS'[12:29] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what does fsync do and by not using that what does get affected?\n'
p7409
aS'[12:29] <phoenix_firebrd> oops\n'
p7410
aS'[12:30] <phoenix_firebrd> I am i disconnected?\n'
p7411
aS'[12:31] <tsimpson> fsync flushes any cache buffers to the disk\n'
p7412
aS'[12:31] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: thats what i thought\n'
p7413
aS'[12:32] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: so is fsync called every 10 sec?\n'
p7414
aS'[12:34] <tsimpson> I think it depends on how much I/O there is, but something like that\n'
p7415
aS'[12:38] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: what will happen if i disable fsync?\n'
p7416
aS'[12:39] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: data in the buffer will be written only when unmounting and manually flushing?\n'
p7417
aS"[12:40] <tsimpson> phoenix_firebrd: that's my understanding, yes\n"
p7418
aS"[12:40] <tsimpson> and only flushed if the files aren't removed, like they would be when pbuilder is done\n"
p7419
aS'[12:42] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: I am working in a desktop with no backup power \n'
p7420
aS'[12:42] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: this wont be good for me\n'
p7421
aS'[12:42] <tsimpson> though the kernel will probably flush at some interval\n'
p7422
aS'[12:42] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: are you sure?\n'
p7423
aS'[12:43] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: is it just for the ext or it applies to all types\n'
p7424
aS'[12:43] <tsimpson> well it only has a finite amount of memory to keep the buffer in\n'
p7425
aS'[12:43] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: thats right\n'
p7426
aS'[12:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: is it compulsary that the files in the debian/patches to have an extensaion .patch or .diff is ok?\n'
p7427
aS"[12:45] <tsimpson> I can't see it being a problem, it would only effect things run with that LD_PRELOAD in the environment\n"
p7428
aS"[12:45] <tsimpson> so it won't effect the rest of the systems calls to fsync\n"
p7429
aS'[12:46] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: ok\n'
p7430
aS'[12:50] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: is it compulsary that the files in the debian/patches to have an extensaion .patch or .diff is ok?\n'
p7431
aS'[12:59] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: sorry, was away\n'
p7432
aS"[12:59] <yofel> the files there are named .diff or .patch by convention, as that's what they are\n"
p7433
aS"[13:00] <yofel> but you'll see both used. I usually use .diff\n"
p7434
aS'[13:01] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok then its time to upload\n'
p7435
aS"[13:02] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: as for fsync. fsync will flush modifications to a file to disk. *Immediately*. It's to tell the filesystem not to wait until it would usually write it to disk\n"
p7436
aS'[13:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: wow that cools my head\n'
p7437
aS'[13:02] <yofel> dpkg runs fsync a lot to make sure its status database files are in a consistent state after a power failure\n'
p7438
aS'[13:02] <phoenix_firebrd> tsimpson: you should note that \n'
p7439
aS'[13:03] <yofel> so it runs fsync afer pretty much every modification - several times per package\n'
p7440
aS"[13:03] <yofel> in a pbuilder chroot you don't care about consistency, so you don't need fsync either. And disabling it speeds things up a lot\n"
p7441
aS'[13:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: nice\n'
p7442
aS'[13:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: when you modify the files that i uploaded in my ppa for example the log file do you download, edit and then upload or you just edit it online?\n'
p7443
aS'[13:09] <yofel> download, edit, upload\n'
p7444
aS'[13:09] <yofel> Launchpad has no online editing feature\n'
p7445
aS'[13:10] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: even when you merge from a branch?\n'
p7446
aS'[13:11] <yofel> then I checkout the main branch, and run \'bzr merge <other_branch_url>" which will merge them locally and then I commit and push\n'
p7447
aS'[13:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what if when you want to edit the changelog before you merge it with the main branch\n'
p7448
aS'[13:13] <yofel> bzr merge will do the merge uncommitted so you can edit it before you push it\n'
p7449
aS'[13:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: edit offline?\n'
p7450
aS'[13:15] <yofel> yes, you do everything on your local system anyway\n'
p7451
aS'[13:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so to confirm, you downloaded from my bazaar branch edited the changelog and then merged with the main, right?\n'
p7452
aS'[13:16] <yofel> no, I merged yours, edited the changes and committed the merge\n'
p7453
aS'[13:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok, thats clear\n'
p7454
aS"[13:17] <yofel> merging a branch doesn't mean you're done. It's just imported as one diff until you commit it\n"
p7455
aS'[13:17] <phoenix_firebrd> right\n'
p7456
aS"[13:18] <yofel> (you only notice that it's a merge from the log)\n"
p7457
aS'[13:18] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i was confused about the editing thing, i thought you edited stuff online\n'
p7458
aS'[13:19] <yofel> ah no. Launchpad has no editor there, so whatever you do has to be done locally\n'
p7459
aS'[13:19] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p7460
aS'[13:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: now packages in my ppa are only built for i386, why is this happening?\n'
p7461
aS'[13:25] <yofel> does the control file have "Achitecture: all" for the binary package?\n'
p7462
aS'[13:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: let me check\n'
p7463
aS'[13:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya it says "All"\n'
p7464
aS'[13:26] <yofel> arch all packages are only built on i386 and can later be used on all\n'
p7465
aS'[13:26] <yofel> http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Architecture\n'
p7466
aS"[13:27] <yofel> it just means that there's nothing architecure-specific in there\n"
p7467
aS'[13:27] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: got it\n'
p7468
aS'[13:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so i should any if i want my package to be built for i386 and amd64\n'
p7469
aS'[13:29] <yofel> right. The usual situation that you have compiled binaries in "any", and things like images, documentation or scripts in "all"\n'
p7470
aS'[13:30] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p7471
aS'[13:30] <yofel> *is that...\n'
p7472
aS'[13:31] <phoenix_firebrd> ?\n'
p7473
aS'[13:31] <yofel> just correcting my sentence\n'
p7474
aS'[13:33] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: is there a deadline to package these http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html ?\n'
p7475
aS"[13:33] <yofel> usually feature freeze, after that you'll need to get an exception for non-bugfix updates\n"
p7476
aS'[13:34] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no not the schedule , for me?\n'
p7477
aS'[13:35] <yofel> that counts for anybody\n'
p7478
aS'[13:35] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: also is anyone else is doing, to avoid work duplication \n'
p7479
aS'[13:35] <yofel> updates need to in the archive before feature freeze\n'
p7480
aS'[13:35] <yofel> oh right, forgot about that\n'
p7481
aS'[13:35] <yofel> the common case is to use update request bugs for that\n'
p7482
aS"[13:36] <yofel> look at launchpad for the 'upgrade-software-version' tag\n"
p7483
aS"[13:37] <yofel> you'll have to file a bug to request sponsorship for a package anyway unless you know someone that can upload it\n"
p7484
aS'[13:37] <yofel> see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SponsorshipProcess\n'
p7485
aS'[13:37] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: are you talking about the source release schedule or the package schedule ?\n'
p7486
aS"[13:37] <yofel> what's the difference?\n"
p7487
aS'[13:37] <yofel> schedule is\n'
p7488
aS'[13:37] <yofel> !schedule\n'
p7489
aS'[13:37] <ubottu> A schedule of Raring Ringtail (13.04) release milestones can be found here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule\n'
p7490
aS'[13:38] <yofel> the freezes are there and apply to every ubuntu contributor\n'
p7491
aS'[13:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: but the title says "Most popular Ubuntu-specific packages that are not in sync with upstream."\n'
p7492
aS'[13:39] <yofel> where?\n'
p7493
aS'[13:39] <yofel> on the qa page?\n'
p7494
aS'[13:39] <phoenix_firebrd> ya\n'
p7495
aS'[13:39] <yofel> ok, sorry, I think I lost the original question in the discussion...\n'
p7496
aS'[13:40] <yofel> what were you asking again?\n'
p7497
aS'[13:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: if you say that the schedule is followed then why are these packages are not not the latest in the repos\n'
p7498
aS'[13:40] <yofel> nobody updated them?\n'
p7499
aS'[13:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p7500
aS'[13:40] <yofel> updating packages with ubuntu modifications is a manual process\n'
p7501
aS"[13:41] <yofel> and there's a limited amount of packagers, and updating packages isn't the only thing to do\n"
p7502
aS'[13:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i thought every package is updated all the time\n'
p7503
aS'[13:41] <yofel> well, it depends on who cares about it\n'
p7504
aS'[13:42] <yofel> there are dedicated teams for various sets of packages, like us for KDE or mozillateam for firefox and co.\n'
p7505
aS"[13:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so the app maintainer doesn't care about this?\n"
p7506
aS"[13:42] <yofel> any packages that don't fall into those catecories in universe are maintained by the MOTU's\n"
p7507
aS'[13:43] <yofel> packages in main by the core-devs (main packages all have dedicated maintainers though usually)\n'
p7508
aS'[13:43] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: what app maintainer?\n'
p7509
aS"[13:43] <yofel> it's not the upstream developer's job to make sure all hundreds distributions ship his software\n"
p7510
aS"[13:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: example the developer of nano doesn't care if it is update in all the distros ?\n"
p7511
aS'[13:44] <yofel> and we have no explicit package maintainers in ubuntu like debian does\n'
p7512
aS"[13:44] <yofel> that's his decision\n"
p7513
aS'[13:44] <yofel> we have plenty of upstream folks poking us in here to please update the packages\n'
p7514
aS"[13:45] <yofel> but that's still a rare case compared to the full list of packages\n"
p7515
aS'[13:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: good\n'
p7516
aS'[13:45] <phoenix_firebrd> ya\n'
p7517
aS'[13:46] <yofel> other than that whether a package is updated or not depend on whether an ubuntu-dev notices it and wants to update it\n'
p7518
aS'[13:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: is this auto generated or updated by someone? http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html\n'
p7519
aS"[13:48] <yofel> automated I think, but I'm not sure\n"
p7520
aS'[13:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: some packages is not the latest in the repos, is that because of the stability taken into account or its not updated simply \n'
p7521
aS"[13:50] <yofel> unless there is an update bug mentioning a reason, it's usually latter\n"
p7522
aS'[13:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so if a stable version of the gimp is released today i can package and put it in the beta ppa ?\n'
p7523
aS'[13:52] <yofel> ppa sure, but if you want to update it for the archive talk to the desktop team first\n'
p7524
aS'[13:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am kubuntu beta ppa\n'
p7525
aS'[13:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am mean kubuntu beta ppa\n'
p7526
aS"[13:55] <yofel> a stable version wouldn't belong in the beta ppa, but the update one. \n"
p7527
aS"[13:55] <yofel> you would need to be a ninja first anyway to have upload permission. And our PPA's are for KDE related stuff really\n"
p7528
aS"[13:56] <yofel> they don't have unlimited space\n"
p7529
aS'[13:56] <BluesKaj> Hey all\n'
p7530
aS'[13:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i should put my question like this. why is the gimp not the latest in the normal channel while i have to add a third party ppa to get the latest\n'
p7531
aS'[13:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: when i was talking about the ppa , i was talking symbolically\n'
p7532
aS'[13:56] <phoenix_firebrd> BluesKaj: hi\n'
p7533
aS'[13:57] <yofel> looks up to date to me...\n'
p7534
aS'[13:57] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: no,  its just an example\n'
p7535
aS'[13:57] <BluesKaj> hi phoenix_firebrd\n'
p7536
aS"[13:58] <yofel> well, as long as you own the PPA, you can put in there what you want as long as you don't violate Launchpad's TOS\n"
p7537
aS'[13:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: for example when ever a stable digikam version is release, if i want it i have to add some philip ppa to get that\n'
p7538
aS"[13:59] <yofel> ah, you shouldn't need that, we try to keep a package for it in our PPA's\n"
p7539
aS"[14:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sorry couldn't understand\n"
p7540
aS"[14:00] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: well, I'm not sure what you're asking. Yes, if you want to put an updated version of digikam in your PPA do it\n"
p7541
aS'[14:00] <yofel> we do the same\n'
p7542
aS'[14:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so you mean that if a stable version of digikam is released, it is packaged and put in the update\n'
p7543
aS"[14:02] <yofel> well, it's like this:\n"
p7544
aS'[14:02] <yofel> if a new digiakm version comes out, someone of us will put an updated package into the development release\n'
p7545
aS"[14:03] <yofel> that is then later backported to the current stable release and possible more in our PPA's\n"
p7546
aS"[14:03] <yofel> if it's a safe backport, someone will file a backport request so it ends up in <release>-backports\n"
p7547
aS"[14:04] <yofel> there isn't really any more than that to it\n"
p7548
aS'[14:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p7549
aS"[14:05] <yofel> in what of our PPA's it ends up depends on what kind of update it is. A 2.8.0 -> 2.8.1 update would be bugfix and end up in the updates one. 2.7.0 -> 2.8.0 is something for backports\n"
p7550
aS'[14:05] <yofel> the 3.0.0~rc is in the beta ppa\n'
p7551
aS'[14:07] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: note that this is the kubuntu team workflow\n'
p7552
aS'[14:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: usually i see in the blog, they say a new stable version is released and they give a ppa to get it, i guess thats a zero hour ppas\n'
p7553
aS'[14:07] <yofel> firefox for example as a core package gets full official updates for all supported releases in the archive\n'
p7554
aS'[14:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya \n'
p7555
aS"[14:08] <yofel> yeah, PPA's are the fastest way to get something out\n"
p7556
aS'[14:08] <yofel> providing updates in the archive for anything other than the development release takes a while\n'
p7557
aS'[14:10] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: does kubuntu contribute security patches upstream?\n'
p7558
aS'[14:10] <yofel> we try to contribute any patches upstream\n'
p7559
aS'[14:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: who is the kubuntu security expert?\n'
p7560
aS"[14:11] <yofel> I'm not sure whether we have one...\n"
p7561
aS'[14:12] <phoenix_firebrd> oh\n'
p7562
aS"[14:12] <yofel> Scott is on the release team and usually knows best what CVE's there are\n"
p7563
aS'[14:15] <yofel> ScottK: do we have someone that looks at the security issues beside you?\n'
p7564
aS'[14:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=kubuntu\n'
p7565
aS'[14:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in this link the version of xz is shown as alpha in 12.10, is that normal?\n'
p7566
aS'[14:20] <yofel> yeah\n'
p7567
aS'[14:20] <yofel> !info xz-utils\n'
p7568
aS'[14:20] <ubottu> xz-utils (source: xz-utils): XZ-format compression utilities. In component main, is optional. Version 5.1.1alpha+20120614-1 (quantal), package size 87 kB, installed size 384 kB\n'
p7569
aS'[14:20] <yofel> it is a snapshot after all\n'
p7570
aS'[14:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so alpha allowed in main?\n'
p7571
aS"[14:22] <yofel> it's the same version as in debian. Maybe dpkg needed some new feature\n"
p7572
aS'[14:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p7573
aS"[14:23] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: it's up to the maintainer, usually you shouldn't do that, but if it has enough value and no critial bugs it's allowed\n"
p7574
aS'[14:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats out of necessity,ok \n'
p7575
aS"[14:24] <yofel> and i would assume that this got plenty of discussion in debian considering it's importance\n"
p7576
aS'[14:25] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p7577
aS'[14:28] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: texi2html is in my ppa, just 1 package in 2 days, because of the republic day holiday and today is sunday.\n'
p7578
aS'[14:28] <yofel> 0.5 packages-per-day is far higher than my quota\n'
p7579
aS'[14:29] <yofel> but then again I wasted the weekend on python and project neon\n'
p7580
aS'[14:29] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the project-neon is the best thing\n'
p7581
aS'[14:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: my mind is confined to c++\n'
p7582
aS'[14:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: also BASIC\n'
p7583
aS'[14:30] <yofel> yeah, better stick to that, the pyhon bindings are a packaging insanity\n'
p7584
aS'[14:31] <phoenix_firebrd> :)\n'
p7585
aS'[14:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: apper is python\n'
p7586
aS'[14:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: muon replaced apper because it was not c++ \n'
p7587
aS'[14:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: why is that so?\n'
p7588
aS'[14:32] <Quintasan> omfg I passed calculus\n'
p7589
aS'[14:32] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: congrats\n'
p7590
aS"[14:32] <yofel> that wasn't really the primary reason, the packagekit apt backend stucking was a more important one\n"
p7591
aS'[14:32] <yofel> *sucking\n'
p7592
aS'[14:33] <Quintasan> I HAVE ABSLOLUTELY NO IDEA what did I write there\n'
p7593
aS'[14:33] <yofel> Quintasan++\n'
p7594
aS'[14:33] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, qapt is awesome\n'
p7595
aS'[14:33] <Quintasan> I succesfully calculated one integral and did some deriviatives\n'
p7596
aS'[14:33] <Quintasan> nothing more and I got 12/20 points\n'
p7597
aS'[14:33] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: have fun reading python-qt4-4.9.6/debian/rules : http://paste.kde.org/657524 (very educative ;P )\n'
p7598
aS"[14:33] <Quintasan> this is either magic or I actually get what's going in there\n"
p7599
aS'[14:34] <phoenix_firebrd> bookmarked\n'
p7600
aS"[14:34] <yofel> it'll expire soon, so just look at the package\n"
p7601
aS'[14:34] <phoenix_firebrd> i will include it with my homework :)\n'
p7602
aS'[14:34] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p7603
aS"[14:34] <yofel> well, you don't really need to understand it...\n"
p7604
aS"[14:35] <yofel> or rather you won't understand it until you know how gnu make handles pattern matching, substitutional references and function calls\n"
p7605
aS'[14:35] <yofel> http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html recommended\n'
p7606
aS'[14:37] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the top priority in things to learn by me is cmake\n'
p7607
aS"[14:38] <yofel> good idea, we're spending plenty of time debugging upstream buildsystems ;)\n"
p7608
aS'[14:39] <phoenix_firebrd> :)\n'
p7609
aS'[14:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: does publishing a built package in a ppa need an admin approval?\n'
p7610
aS"[14:40] <yofel> no, it's a cronjob that runs every half an hour or so\n"
p7611
aS'[14:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p7612
aS'[14:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I think i forgot to debuild after i updated the changelog\n'
p7613
aS'[14:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I am going to delete the package in the ppa and rename the version from 5.0-0ubuntu1~ubuntu13.04~ppa1 to ?\n'
p7614
aS'[14:46] <phoenix_firebrd> brb\n'
p7615
aS'[14:48] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: why delete it, just change it to ppa2\n'
p7616
aS'[14:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p7617
aS'[14:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the old file name was 01_remove_doc_dir.patch and the new file name is 01_remove_doc_dir.diff. the changelog should reflect as "Refresh 01_remove_doc_dir.diff for the new release"?\n'
p7618
aS"[14:54] <yofel> in a case where you just refresh a patch don't rename it\n"
p7619
aS'[14:54] <yofel> otherwise yes\n'
p7620
aS'[14:55] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in the process got renamed, what should i put in the log\n'
p7621
aS'[14:56] <yofel> why was it renamed?\n'
p7622
aS'[14:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: when creating a patch with quilt , i forgot to use the the extension .patch and it was named with an extension .diff by default\n'
p7623
aS'[14:57] <yofel> just rename it back\n'
p7624
aS'[14:57] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: will that work?\n'
p7625
aS'[14:57] <yofel> as long as you also change it in the series file, yes\n'
p7626
aS'[14:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i will try that\n'
p7627
aS'[15:01] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: works\n'

aS'[15:32] <sheytan> btw, i have to work for an hour to earn that much money :D\n'
p7664
aS'[15:32] <sheytan> welcome to Poland :D\n'
p7665
aS'[15:32] <apachelogger> downloading mono for wine takes forevr\n'
p7666
aS'[15:32] <sheytan> what you use wine for?\n'
p7667
aS'[15:32] <apachelogger> getting drunk\n'
p7668
aS'[15:32] <sheytan> oh\n'
p7669
aS'[15:32] <sheytan> stupid question\n'
p7670
aS"[15:33] <apachelogger> sheytan: you probably don't need a cloud storage then btw\n"
p7671
aS'[15:33] <tsimpson> you get drunk, then you get mono\n'
p7672
aS'[15:33] <sheytan> apachelogger: i do! :D\n'
p7673
aS'[15:33] <sheytan> well, in my case i get some more money for one hour of work\n'
p7674
aS'[15:33] <sheytan> but in Poland usually you get even less then 2 eur\n'
p7675
aS'[15:33] <apachelogger> ...storing porn in the cloud is not wise\n'
p7676
aS'[15:34] <sheytan> i stream. always.\n'
p7677
aS"[15:35] <apachelogger> you don't need a cloud then\n"
p7678
aS'[15:38]  * shadeslayer needs the cloud for contact storage\n'
p7679
aS'[15:39] <sheytan> apachelogger: well, i use other files too ;d\n'
p7680
aS'[15:39] <sheytan> not only p0rn\n'
p7681
aS'[15:39] <apachelogger> so why do they need to be in the coud?\n'
p7682
aS"[15:39] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: don't you use googleseee for that?\n"
p7683
aS'[15:39] <shadeslayer> I do\n'
p7684
aS"[15:40] <shadeslayer> I fear I'm too tied into Google \n"
p7685
aS"[15:40] <shadeslayer> I'm more or less at the mercy of Google :P\n"
p7686
aS'[15:40] <apachelogger> personally I have almost no value from synced addressbooks\n'
p7687
aS'[15:41] <apachelogger> people I send mails to I usually do not call and vice versa\n'
p7688
aS'[15:41] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p7689
aS'[15:41] <apachelogger> though I suspect it is one of the arears where cloud sync actually adds value\n'
p7690
aS'[15:41] <apachelogger> from a business perspective at least\n'
p7691
aS"[15:42] <apachelogger> for the regular person I still think the mail && !call statement holds, particular since I suppose most people don't use mail anymore ^^\n"
p7692
aS'[15:47] <sheytan> apachelogger: i have files like documents and pictures i need to have access to\n'
p7693
aS'[15:48] <sheytan> and my problem is that i forget to put them on a pendrive or something\n'
p7694
aS'[15:48] <sheytan> so i better save it as default in the dropbox folder\n'
p7695
aS'[15:48] <sheytan> so they automatically sync \n'
p7696
aS'[15:50] <sheytan> does owncloud sync notes too?\n'
p7697
aS'[15:52] <apachelogger> owncloud supports arbitrary plugins\n'
p7698
aS'[15:59] <sheytan> apachelogger: you askd me last time when i showd the lightdm theme if i talk to Nuno. Why?\n'
p7699
aS"[16:00] <apachelogger> sheytan: because we continue to follow upstream's artwork\n"
p7700
aS'[16:00] <sheytan> ah\n'
p7701
aS'[16:00] <sheytan> ok\n'
p7702
aS"[16:01] <sheytan> apachelogger: but KDE didn't switch to lightdm or did they?\n"
p7703
aS'[16:01] <apachelogger> lightdm is a kde project\n'
p7704
aS'[16:02] <sheytan> so KDM is out ?\n'
p7705
aS'[16:02] <shadeslayer> afaik both kdm and lightdm will be in kde-workspace\n'
p7706
aS'[16:02] <apachelogger> plus nuno wanted to do some artwork alignment for 4.11\n'
p7707
aS"[16:02] <shadeslayer> or atleast that's what d_ed is aiming for\n"
p7708
aS'[16:02] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: nuno also advocates lightdm from what I understand\n'
p7709
aS'[16:03] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: I see, probably because of QML stuff though :P\n'
p7710
aS'[16:03] <apachelogger> that is a fair assumption :P\n'
p7711
aS"[16:03] <shadeslayer> what I'm saying is, KDM will be around though probably not actively developed\n"
p7712
aS'[16:03] <shadeslayer> lightdm offers the exact same feature set with the added niceness of QML\n'
p7713
aS'[16:03] <shadeslayer> and being actively developed\n'
p7714
aS'[16:04] <sheytan> shadeslayer: already saw my new lightdm theme? :)\n'
p7715
aS'[16:04] <shadeslayer> though the latter is probably the result of the project being quite new\n'
p7716
aS'[16:04] <shadeslayer> sheytan: yes, imho it clashes with Air\n'
p7717
aS"[16:04] <shadeslayer> dark backgrounds + Air don't go well together\n"
p7718
aS'[16:04] <sheytan> i have a light version too :D\n'
p7719
aS'[16:04] <sheytan> first i was doing dark, cause i done it for my desktop ;)\n'
p7720
aS'[16:05] <shadeslayer> but then again, you can change the background\n'
p7721
aS'[16:05] <shadeslayer> so meh\n'
p7722
aS'[16:05] <shadeslayer> and the login manager should be as un-obtrusive as possible\n'
p7723
aS'[16:06] <shadeslayer> like, Users should have big avatars\n'
p7724
aS'[16:06] <shadeslayer> and password boxes\n'
p7725
aS"[16:06] <shadeslayer> since that's the focus ... hibernating/shutdown/sleeping are just added extras\n"
p7726
aS'[16:07] <shadeslayer> oh and we need to figure out if we can support RDP stuff\n'
p7727
aS"[16:07] <sheytan> i'm not a fan of big things\n"
p7728
aS'[16:07] <shadeslayer> like they showed off at UDS\n'
p7729
aS'[16:07] <shadeslayer> that stuff was awesome\n'
p7730
aS'[16:07] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: rdpwhat?\n'
p7731
aS"[16:07] <sheytan> they don't look good\n"
p7732
aS'[16:07] <sheytan> shadeslayer: what did they show?\n'
p7733
aS'[16:07] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: they established a RDP session right from the login manager\n'
p7734
aS'[16:07] <sheytan> can i see it?\n'
p7735
aS'[16:08] <shadeslayer> so they logged into a Windows session running on EC2\n'
p7736
aS'[16:08] <shadeslayer> from lightdm\n'
p7737
aS'[16:08] <shadeslayer> lemme see if I can pull up the video\n'
p7738
aS'[16:08] <sheytan> sure\n'
p7739
aS'[16:08] <apachelogger> Oo\n'
p7740
aS'[16:08] <apachelogger> things people do with a login manager\n'
p7741
aS"[16:11] <shadeslayer> can't find it\n"
p7742
aS'[16:11] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: actually, it makes sense in a business env\n'
p7743
aS'[16:12] <shadeslayer> sheytan: http://zbloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/remote-login-lightdm-ubuntu1210.png\n'
p7744
aS'[16:13] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: does it?\n'
p7745
aS'[16:13] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: yes\n'
p7746
aS'[16:13] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: you have some proprietary service tied into Windows\n'
p7747
aS'[16:13] <shadeslayer> but you have ubuntu deployed across your office\n'
p7748
aS'[16:14] <shadeslayer> so you just setup EC2 and provide access to that one windows machine\n'
p7749
aS'[16:14] <shadeslayer> where that service is running\n'
p7750
aS'[16:14] <apachelogger> so you logout and then login again to get to a windows session?\n'
p7751
aS"[16:14] <apachelogger> that's a funny concept\n"
p7752
aS'[16:14] <shadeslayer> well ... you could spawn a new session\n'
p7753
aS'[16:14] <shadeslayer> like you can do in KDE\n'
p7754
aS'[16:14] <apachelogger> so you can easily switch back to your ubuntu session?\n'
p7755
aS'[16:14] <apachelogger> oh wait\n'
p7756
aS"[16:14] <apachelogger> you can't\n"
p7757
aS'[16:14] <shadeslayer> wot\n'
p7758
aS'[16:15] <shadeslayer> no I mean\n'
p7759
aS'[16:15] <apachelogger> I know what you mean\n'
p7760
aS'[16:15] <shadeslayer> spawn a new X\n'
p7761
aS'[16:15] <shadeslayer> X1 is running unity \n'
p7762
aS'[16:15] <apachelogger> and it is fom a usage perspective exactly the same as logout and login\n'
p7763
aS'[16:15] <shadeslayer> X2 is running RDP session\n'
p7764
aS'[16:15] <shadeslayer> hm, idk, it made alot of sense to me to have the remote login thingy\n'
p7765
aS'[16:15] <apachelogger> yeah\n'
p7766
aS'[16:16] <apachelogger> in a thin client setup\n'
p7767
aS'[16:16] <shadeslayer> something KDE fails at ? :P\n'
p7768
aS"[16:16] <apachelogger> at the point where I roll out a system that has multiarch on a thin client setup I'll shoot mysefl in the head though\n"
p7769
aS"[16:16] <apachelogger> doubtlessly there are people who'd do that though\n"
p7770
aS'[16:16] <shadeslayer> apparently KDE does too much network IO in a thin client setup\n'
p7771
aS'[16:18] <apachelogger> plasma does too much IO\n'
p7772
aS'[16:18] <apachelogger> so how do you make the touchpad deactivate when typing?\n'
p7773
aS'[16:19] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'
p7774
aS'[16:19] <shadeslayer> synaptiks\n'
p7775
aS'[16:19] <shadeslayer> I think\n'

p7901
aS'[07:50] <shadeslayer> wtf\n'
p7902
aS'[07:51] <shadeslayer> vlc is just skipping over 80% of the song\n'
p7903
aS'[07:51] <shadeslayer> so is amarok\n'
p7904
aS'[07:59] <shadeslayer> as does ... chrome O_O\n'
p7905
aS'[08:08] <jussi> shadeslayer: ahh I remember something like that in the past... on amarok\n'
p7906
aS'[08:09] <shadeslayer> I think that file is corrupted\n'
p7907
aS'[08:09] <jussi> well that would explain it...\n'
p7908
aS'[08:09] <jussi> lol\n'
p7909
aS'[08:10] <shadeslayer> yeah, playing other files works\n'
p7910
aS'[08:11] <jussi> iirc, it was playing files over networks last time that was the iddue\n'

p7923
aS"[09:10] <Peace-> and it doesn't find the package\n"
p7924
aS"[09:11] <Peace-> samba still doesn't work ...\n"
p7925
aS'[09:43] <shadeslayer> btw\n'
p7926
aS'[09:43] <shadeslayer> does it make sense to add a page to the installer asking the user to choose a browser?\n'
p7927
aS'[09:44] <shadeslayer> Peace-: what pops that question?\n'
p7928
aS'[09:47] <yofel_> shadeslayer: that would need a short pro/con list integrated so people can actually make an educated choice\n'
p7929
aS"[09:48] <shadeslayer> why? I'd say that list rekonq/chromium/firefox\n"
p7930
aS'[09:48] <shadeslayer> most people would know about those\n'
p7931
aS"[09:48] <shadeslayer> if they don't, stick with the default\n"
p7932
aS'[09:48] <shadeslayer> ( which will be rekonq )\n'
p7933
aS"[09:50] <yofel_> as microsoft got forced to add a browser choice I guess it's fair to have one\n"
p7934
aS'[09:50] <yofel_> question is where to put it\n'
p7935
aS'[09:50] <shadeslayer> after the page where we ask if the user wants to install codecs\n'
p7936
aS'[09:50] <yofel_> the only customization currently is the third-party checkbox at the beginning\n'
p7937
aS'[09:50] <shadeslayer> right\n'
p7938
aS'[09:50] <shadeslayer> we add 3 huge icons\n'
p7939
aS'[09:50] <shadeslayer> because people like huge icons\n'
p7940
aS'[09:50] <yofel_> hm, true. Needs to be before the installation start, which is after partitioning\n'
p7941
aS'=== yofel_ is now known as yofel\n'
p7942
aS'[09:51] <shadeslayer> right\n'
p7943
aS'[09:51] <shadeslayer> it also needs to check if the user is connected to the network\n'
p7944
aS'[09:51] <shadeslayer> which brings us to\n'
p7945
aS'[09:51] <shadeslayer> wifi support in the installer\n'
p7946
aS'[09:52]  * shadeslayer is checking out ubiquity to check how difficult this is going to be\n'
p7947
aS"[09:52] <yofel> wasn't that only hanging on insufficient developer time?\n"
p7948
aS"[09:52] <shadeslayer> then there's also the webcam stuff that the gtk ui of ubiquity has\n"
p7949
aS"[09:52] <shadeslayer> yofel: dunno, but I'm compiling a list of features I want to work on next month\n"
p7950
aS'[09:52] <yofel> what for? user logo?\n'
p7951
aS'[09:52] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p7952
aS'[09:53] <xnox> gtk - has wifi page. The base controller is network aware and can tell plugins/pages whether or not there are internetz.\n'
p7953
aS'[09:53] <shadeslayer> seems fairly trivial\n'
p7954
aS'[09:53] <shadeslayer> ( just from reading the webcam plugin )\n'
p7955
aS'[09:53] <shadeslayer> xnox: cool :)\n'
p7956
aS"[09:53] <shadeslayer> xnox: I'm going to need all the help I can get to implement this :P\n"
p7957
aS"[09:53] <shadeslayer> yofel: I'm also thinking of doing this in QML xD\n"
p7958
aS'[09:54] <yofel> ack\n'
p7959
aS"[09:54] <yofel> that's the way to go with qt5 anyway\n"
p7960
aS"[09:54] <shadeslayer> xnox: do you think that if I write a page to choose a browser, that's going to be accepted?\n"
p7961
aS'[09:54] <shadeslayer> or would that go against some sort of design or sth\n'
p7962
aS'[09:54] <yofel> though porting ubiquity to qml is probably something for post-14.04\n'
p7963
aS'[09:55] <shadeslayer> *nod*\n'
p7964
aS"[09:55] <shadeslayer> but I don't want to use .ui for new stuff\n"
p7965
aS'[09:55] <shadeslayer> better to just write it in QML\n'
p7966
aS"[09:56] <yofel> sure, if the looks aren't too different, go ahead\n"
p7967
aS"[09:56] <xnox> shadeslayer: i am really confused why one would want to choose a browser, considering that we are not forced by law (yet) and it's a waste of space on the CD (majority will pick default/first and the other one will be removed by ubiquity at cleanup)\n"
p7968
aS'[09:56] <yofel> i just has to fit into ubiquity overall\n'
p7969
aS'[09:56] <shadeslayer> yofel: right\n'
p7970
aS"[09:56] <shadeslayer> xnox: oh I don't plan on including the browser on the CD\n"
p7971
aS'[09:56] <xnox> shadeslayer: my position here is that sort of thing should be done on first-login instead.\n'
p7972
aS"[09:57] <shadeslayer> xnox: it's like the restricted codecs\n"
p7973
aS'[09:57] <shadeslayer> you can tick off "I also want to install Firefox/Chromium" and we add that to the list of things to be installed\n'
p7974
aS"[09:57] <xnox> shadeslayer: it's nothing like resticted codecs (which we are not allowed on the CD). Unless you are trying to offer Chrome/Opera?!\n"
p7975
aS'[09:58] <shadeslayer> xnox: I meant in terms of implementation\n'
p7976
aS'[09:58] <shadeslayer> it *would* be like that\n'
p7977
aS'[09:58] <xnox> shadeslayer: out of scope, make the installation longer, confusing & technical. You are free to do it in the qt frontend =)\n'
p7978
aS"[09:58] <shadeslayer> xnox: that's what I was asking about :P\n"
p7979
aS'[09:58] <xnox> but gtk frontend will not be having that ;-)\n'
p7980
aS'[09:58] <shadeslayer> right\n'
p7981
aS"[09:59] <shadeslayer> it's just that our users are asking for this\n"
p7982
aS'[09:59] <shadeslayer> because our current default browser is not up to the mark\n'
p7983
aS'[09:59] <shadeslayer> I wonder if we can switch to chromium by default\n'
p7984
aS'[09:59] <shadeslayer> oh wait, not in line with our cycle\n'
p7985
aS'[10:02] <shadeslayer> xnox: btw how do you test new stuff in ubiquity?\n'
p7986
aS'[10:05] <xnox> lubuntu uses chromium by default.\n'
p7987
aS'[10:05] <shadeslayer> I see\n'
p7988
aS'[10:06]  * shadeslayer will ask lubuntu devs how their experience has been\n'
p7989
aS'[10:06] <xnox> shadeslayer: depends, usually I boot a VM into installer. stop lightdm, stop ubiquity, pkill -9 X, download/patch individual files, and start ubiquity again.\n'
p7990
aS'[10:06] <shadeslayer> bah :P\n'
p7991
aS'[10:06] <shadeslayer> sounds like alot of work\n'
p7992
aS'[10:06] <xnox> (where start is literal $ start/stop are literal)\n'
p7993
aS"[10:07] <xnox> it's safe.\n"
p7994
aS'[10:07] <shadeslayer> okay\n'
p7995
aS'[10:12] <Riddell> shadeslayer: how much does plasma active need that fuse patch?\n'
p7996
aS"[10:12] <shadeslayer> I don't remember, I can't find the IRC logs I saved\n"
p7997
aS"[10:13] <shadeslayer> I'll ask in #active again\n"
p7998
aS'[10:15] <shadeslayer> Riddell: <notmart> shadeslayer: pa3 will still work..\n'
p7999
aS'[10:19] <shadeslayer> good thing we added it earlier in the cycle rather than later ....\n'
p8000
aS'[10:19] <shadeslayer> Riddell: btw I also have bodega packaging, but all of it needs descriptions and reviewing\n'
p8001
aS"[10:20] <shadeslayer> I can't think up of a good description ... so haven't uploaded it anywhere\n"
p8002
aS"[10:22] <Riddell> shadeslayer: that's the PA software shop thing?\n"
p8003
aS'[10:22] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p8004
aS"[10:24] <Riddell> shadeslayer: there's your description :)\n"
p8005
aS'[10:24] <shadeslayer> bodega : "PA software shop thing"\n'
p8006
aS'[10:29] <sem_> shadeslayer: i have a nexus tablet 7 and when i have installed kio-mpt i was able to browse nexus with usb cable\n'
p8007
aS'[10:29] <sem_> shadeslayer: after that i got that pop\n'
p8008
aS'[10:30] <sem_> wtf i have  a different nick\n'
p8009
aS'=== sem_ is now known as Peace-\n'
p8010
aS'[10:30] <Peace-> shadeslayer: ^ sem was me \n'
p8011
aS'[10:30] <shadeslayer> righto\n'
p8012
aS'[10:30] <shadeslayer> I see\n'
p8013
aS'[10:31] <shadeslayer> Peace-: check if you have kio-mtp installed?\n'
p8014
aS'[10:31] <Peace-> i have \n'
p8015
aS"[10:31] <shadeslayer> if it is, then that shouldn't pop up\n"
p8016
aS'[10:31] <Peace-> infact i can browse \n'
p8017
aS'[10:31] <Peace-> but ...when i click on a video it says that i need mtp stuff\n'
p8018
aS'[10:31] <shadeslayer> sounds like a bug in qapt?\n'
p8019
aS'[10:31] <Peace-> so i searched like it says\n'
p8020
aS'[10:31] <shadeslayer> 0.o\n'
p8021
aS'[10:31] <Peace-> and it did not find the package\n'
p8022
aS'[10:32] <Peace-> shadeslayer: i guess no \n'
p8023
aS"[10:32] <Peace-> shadeslayer: cuz dragon player can't play file from nexus\n"
p8024
aS'[10:32] <Peace-> instead vlc can \n'
p8025
aS'[10:32] <Peace-> i guess that dragon player needs some package to play file from mtp devices\n'
p8026
aS'[10:32] <shadeslayer> kind of\n'
p8027
aS'[10:32] <Peace-> but i have even tried to install mtp-tools+\n'
p8028
aS'[10:32] <Peace-> and nothing is changed\n'
p8029
aS'[10:33] <shadeslayer> Peace-: make sure you have the requisite gst plugins\n'
p8030
aS'[10:33] <shadeslayer> gst-{good,bad,ugly}\n'
p8031
aS"[10:33] <shadeslayer> Peace-: what's the video format?\n"
p8032
aS'[10:33] <Peace-> i guess mov ?\n'
p8033
aS'[10:33] <Peace-> h264 codec\n'
p8034
aS'[10:33] <Peace-> for sure\n'
p8035
aS'[10:34] <Peace-> ok shadeslayeri will try to investigate better\n'
p8036
aS'[10:34] <shadeslayer> install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly\n'
p8037
aS'[10:34] <shadeslayer> should work after that\n'
p8038
aS'[10:39] <Peace-> shadeslayer: btw the idea to ask which browser user want install is good\n'
p8039
aS'[10:48] <Riddell> rperier: new nick?\n'
p8040
aS"[10:52] <rperier> Riddell: yeah it's more professional ;)\n"
p8041

p8042
aS'[10:54] <shadeslayer> wtf\n'
p8043
aS'[10:55] <Peace-> shadeslayer: i have already installed gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-base\n'
p8044
aS'[10:55] <shadeslayer> right\n'
p8045
aS'[10:55] <Peace-> but it seems it suck ;D\n'
p8046
aS'[10:55] <shadeslayer> yeah\n'
p8047
aS'[10:55] <shadeslayer> something else is wrong\n'
p8048
aS'[10:55] <Peace-> bah :D \n'
p8049
aS'[10:55] <Peace-> shadeslayer: but with vlc works fine \n'
p8050
aS'[10:56] <Peace-> dragonplayer again sucks\n'
p8051
aS'[10:56] <shadeslayer> yeah pgst is buggy\n'
p8052
aS'[10:56] <shadeslayer> Peace-: apachelogger probably has a better idea\n'
p8053
aS'[10:56] <Peace-> shadeslayer: well there is not a problem shadeslayer i mean i use vlc \n'
p8054
aS'[10:57] <Peace-> but at least you know that there is some problem  about mtp and dragonplayer and qapt\n'
p8055
aS'[10:57] <shadeslayer> right\n'
p8056
aS"[10:57] <shadeslayer> it's not about mtp, it's some weird problem between dragon and pgst and qapt\n"
p8057
aS'[10:57] <Peace-> ya\n'
p8058
aS'[10:57] <Peace-> even samba has again a problem \n'

p8071
aS'[11:16] <xnox> yofel: thanks.\n'
p8072
aS"[11:19] <fabo> xnox: it's going to be uploaded to experimental (today on in the next couple of days)\n"

p8074

p8075

p8076
aS'[11:20] <xnox> fabo: any help needed?\n'
p8077
aS"[11:20] <tsimpson> there are the PPA(s) from https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers too if you're impatient\n"
p8078

p8079
aS"[11:21] <fabo> xnox: you'll need new qt4 packages to co-exist with qt5\n"
p8080
aS"[11:21] <xnox> tsimpson: I'm impatient to stop using that repository & start pointing people to the archive =)\n"
p8081
aS'[11:24] <Peace-> shadeslayer: mmm maybe samba is fixed on rarin \n'
p8082
aS'[11:24] <Peace-> i just checked again \n'
p8083
aS"[11:24] <xnox> fabo: as far as I can see, once ready. You will be able to sync/upload it everywhere in Raring, won't you?! And then i can chase up Archive Admins to fast track new binary packages through ubuntu new queue.\n"
p8084
aS'[11:25] <shadeslayer> Peace-: awesome\n'
p8085
aS"[11:25] <xnox> I'd rather not wait for Debian New Queue delay.\n"

aS'[12:32] <shadeslayer> the pyqt ones are somehwat documented if lacking features\n'

p8117
aS'[12:36] <apachelogger> that is why it is not supported\n'
p8118
aS'[12:36] <shadeslayer> ah\n'
p8119
aS"[12:37] <Peace-> apachelogger: it's ok but ... why qapt asks to find stuff ?\n"
p8120
aS'[12:37] <apachelogger> because you are trying to stream from KIO\n'

p8125
aS'[12:38] <apachelogger> it copies the file\n'
p8126
aS'[12:38] <shadeslayer> yes, because vlc does not use kio!\n'
p8127
aS'[12:39] <Peace-> ah\n'

p8138
aS"[13:04] <shadeslayer> xnox: question, if I read this correctly, do I just add a PageKde class to ubiquity/plugins/ubi-webcam.py along with a ui file and it'll pop up in the installer?\n"
p8139
aS'[13:05] <xnox> shadeslayer: it should. You will need some webcamy widget (as for gtk we wrote our own using Gtk).\n'
p8140
aS'[13:06] <xnox> shadeslayer: also check if webcam makes sense at all.\n'
p8141
aS'[13:06] <xnox> on gtk side it sets the user account avatar to that picture.\n'
p8142
aS"[13:06] <xnox> I don't know if KDE has user account avatars or shows them to the user at all.\n"
p8143
aS'[13:06] <shadeslayer> xnox: for the first, I wrote this very small program that does it : http://paste.kde.org/658238/\n'
p8144
aS'[13:06] <xnox> As the alternative to webcam picutre one can choose one of the stock images.\n'
p8145
aS'[13:06] <shadeslayer> and yes, we have lightdm kde which does show it\n'
p8146
aS'[13:06] <shadeslayer> as well as the kicker\n'
p8147
aS"[13:07] <xnox> awesome. lightdm on the ubuntu side doesn't show pictures =/\n"
p8148
aS'[13:07] <shadeslayer> heh :)\n'
p8149
aS'[13:07] <xnox> that phonon snippet looks good =)\n'
p8150
aS'[13:07] <shadeslayer> *nod* :P\n'
p8151
aS'[13:09] <shadeslayer> xnox: the gtk implementation seems a bit ew\n'
p8152
aS"[13:10] <xnox> shadeslayer: i don't think at the time there was a webcam widget at all.\n"
p8153
aS'[13:10] <xnox> shadeslayer: do you know if there is one now?\n'
p8154
aS'[13:10] <xnox> we could port it....\n'
p8155
aS'[13:10] <shadeslayer> not that I know of, nope\n'
p8156
aS"[13:10] <shadeslayer> sorry, I don't follow gtk development that closely :P\n"
p8157
aS"[13:11] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: note that a videoplayer is comprised of a videowidget and an audiooutput, I do not thin you'll need an audiooutput\n"
p8158
aS'[13:11] <shadeslayer> oic\n'
p8159
aS"[13:11] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: I don't think I'll be using the exact same code anyway\n"
p8160
aS'[13:11] <xnox> there is libcheese-gtk-dev, not sure if it has python bindings and/or available on the cd already.\n'
p8161
aS"[13:12] <shadeslayer> I'll probably embed the videowidget\n"
p8162
aS'[13:12] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: yeah, just pointing it out ;)\n'
p8163
aS'[13:12] <shadeslayer> into a ui file\n'
p8164
aS'[13:12] <shadeslayer> :)\n'
p8165
aS'[13:12] <xnox> usb-creator with flashing nexus7 images just got uploaded into ubuntu.\n'
p8166
aS"[13:12] <xnox> i am not expecting for kde frontend to break, but i didn't test it.\n"
p8167
aS"[13:13] <xnox> and also i didn't add the UI to the kde frontend to have support for flashing nexus7 images.\n"
p8168
aS'[13:13] <apachelogger> actually it has some bugs that need to be looked at anyway\n'
p8169
aS"[13:15] <petersaints> I just noticed that there's a newer version of rekonq 2.1. Will it reach quantal backports? Also Ktorrent is still at 4.2 in the official repos and 4.3.1 is already available. Any plans to backport it?\n"
p8170
aS'[13:16] <Riddell> hmm, I really need to do an upstream health script\n'
p8171
aS"[13:16] <Riddell> thanks petersaints, we'll get those done\n"
p8172
aS'[13:16] <petersaints> tks RIdell\n'
p8173
aS'[13:17] <xnox> Riddell: is the python3 port of usb-creator-kde complete?\n'
p8174
aS"[13:17] <Riddell> xnox: it's needing you to test it :)\n"
p8175
aS"[13:17]  * xnox , by accident, didn't upload it\n"
p8176
aS"[13:18] <Riddell> xnox: you accidently didn't upload it?\n"
p8177
aS'[13:18] <xnox> correct =)\n'
p8178
aS"[13:18] <xnox> Riddell: well ./bin/usb-creator-kde shebang wasn't changed to python3, but now I am installing python3-pykde4 to test it.\n"
p8179
aS'[13:18] <Riddell> thanks\n'
p8180
aS'[13:20] <xnox> Riddell: surprisingly the theming is nice. It almost looks like a GTK app.\n'
p8181
aS'[13:21] <xnox> I wonder if a few icons can be remapped to gtk icons and then the two would be like the same.\n'
p8182
aS"[13:21] <apachelogger> it's the Qt way\n"
p8183
aS'[13:21] <xnox> no unity integration in the doc, no icon, no progress =(\n'
p8184
aS"[13:22] <xnox> but i guess, usb-creator-kde doesn't care about that ;-)\n"
p8185
aS'[13:24] <Riddell> xnox: no surprise there, Qt put in a lot of effort to making it integrate into gtk environments\n'
p8186
aS"[13:24] <Riddell> shame the opposite doesn't happen\n"
p8187
aS"[13:25] <Riddell> xnox: oh I see you're making changes for nexus7 is usb-creator, any UI in that?\n"
p8188
aS'[13:25] <xnox> i think it did at one point.\n'
p8189
aS"[13:26] <xnox> Riddell: the gtk frontend, checks for fastboot backend and then it does some changes to the UI: updates some strings, skips showing .iso (.img only), add legal text button & poop-up. And that's about it.\n"
p8190
aS'[13:26] <xnox> some pointless columns are hidden in the tree view.\n'
p8191
aS'[13:27] <xnox> there is an upstart job to poop-up usb-creator, when nexus7 is inserted. And currently that is shipped in the -gtk package, but can move into -common when kde frontend is ready as well.\n'
p8192
aS'[13:28] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p8193
aS'[13:29] <shadeslayer> xnox: turns out the phonon gst backend we have in the archive cannot save snapshots :P\n'
p8194
aS'[13:29] <shadeslayer> we need a new phonon gstreamer release\n'
p8195
aS'[13:29] <xnox> 8-)\n'
p8196
aS'[13:30] <apachelogger> nono\n'
p8197
aS'[13:30] <shadeslayer> ?\n'
p8198
aS'[13:30] <apachelogger> what we need is someone to QA a new release so that I can make that happen\n'
p8199
aS'[13:31] <shadeslayer> you have a new pgst release lined up?\n'
p8200
aS'[13:31] <apachelogger> doing the release is a no-brainer, getting it QAd is apparently a half a year task\n'
p8201
aS'[13:31] <shadeslayer> lol\n'
p8202
aS'[13:31] <apachelogger> I have releases of both bakends lined up since dec 7\n'
p8203
aS'[13:31] <apachelogger> I even asked kde-testing to do QA\n'
p8204
aS'[13:31] <apachelogger> no dice\n'
p8205
aS"[13:31] <shadeslayer> give me the tars, I'll make a package and someone here can test\n"
p8206
aS'[13:31] <apachelogger> so here we are almost 2 months later, still no release in sight :P\n'
p8207
aS'[13:32] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: you saw my QA document :P\n'
p8208
aS'[13:32] <shadeslayer> oh\n'
p8209
aS'[13:32] <shadeslayer> shit\n'
p8210
aS'[13:32] <shadeslayer> not that \n'
p8211
aS"[13:32] <yofel> before you do phonon q/a tell me what's needed to get python kcms working again - or where to look (i.e. KPPF or pykde)\n"
p8212
aS'[13:32]  * shadeslayer runs away\n'
p8213
aS'[13:32] <apachelogger> it is a requirement to build that crap from source and run like 300 test cases\n'
p8214
aS'[13:32] <apachelogger> yofel: tell  me where my pykde source is\n'
p8215
aS'[13:33] <yofel> pull-lp-source pykde4 raring\n'
p8216
aS"[13:33] <apachelogger> though I think I have those on my other pc, so I won't get to them before this evening\n"
p8217
aS'[13:33] <apachelogger> yofel: I have a patch\n'
p8218
aS'[13:33] <yofel> gimme so I can Q/A that later\n'
p8219
aS'[13:33] <apachelogger> CANNOT DO\n'
p8220
aS'[13:34]  * yofel steals patches from fedora in the meanwhile\n'
p8221
aS'[13:34] <apachelogger> upstream it actually\n'
p8222
aS'[13:34] <xnox> Riddell: installed fine using python3 \\0/\n'
p8223
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> that is actually why I lost it, I was looking for a way to contact upstream and then got distructed by something or someone\n'
p8224
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> *distracted\n'
p8225
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> trololo\n'
p8226
aS"[13:35] <yofel> that's what reviewboard is for?\n"
p8227
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> no\n'
p8228
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> reviewboard is for us to waste time\n'
p8229
aS'[13:35] <Riddell> xnox: awooga, will you upload at some point or shall I?\n'
p8230
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> because people are afraid of gerrit\n'
p8231
aS'[13:36] <apachelogger> just like bugzilla is for us to waste time\n'
p8232
aS'[13:36] <apachelogger> becasue people are afraid of jira\n'
p8233
aS'[13:36] <yofel> huh, why?\n'
p8234
aS"[13:36] <xnox> Riddell: i'll do it, now.\n"
p8235
aS'[13:36] <yofel> (jira)\n'
p8236
aS'[13:36] <xnox> Riddell: usb-creator - the most active upstream project of today! Two new releases in a single day =)\n'
p8237
aS'[13:39] <apachelogger> yofel: because it is not free sofware\n'
p8238
aS'[13:40] <shadeslayer> xnox: does ubiquity simply copy the image to ~/.face ?\n'
p8239
aS'[13:40] <shadeslayer> erm\n'
p8240
aS'[13:40] <shadeslayer> ~/.face.icon\n'
p8241
aS'[13:41] <apachelogger> oh btw\n'
p8242
aS'[13:41] <apachelogger> kde uses .face\n'
p8243
aS'[13:41] <shadeslayer> nope\n'
p8244
aS'[13:41] <apachelogger> dude\n'
p8245
aS'[13:41] <shadeslayer> ~/.face.icon\n'
p8246
aS'[13:41] <shadeslayer> Check it for yourself\n'
p8247
aS'[13:42] <apachelogger> who was using .face then?\n'
p8248
aS'[13:42] <apachelogger> gnome?\n'
p8249
aS'[13:42] <apachelogger> someone was using .face\n'
p8250
aS'[13:42] <shadeslayer> .face is deprecated\n'
p8251
aS'[13:42] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: was that changed in .10 then?\n'
p8252
aS'[13:42] <shadeslayer> iirc xdg specified ~/.face\n'
p8253
aS'[13:42] <shadeslayer> nope\n'
p8254
aS'[13:42] <shadeslayer> iirc ~/.face.icon has been there for a couple of releases now\n'
p8255
aS"[13:42] <shadeslayer> before that, I didn't notice it\n"
p8256
aS'[13:42] <apachelogger> nono\n'
p8257
aS'[13:42] <apachelogger> see\n'
p8258
aS"[13:42] <shadeslayer> as in, I didn't bother checking\n"
p8259
aS'[13:43] <apachelogger> the reason in quantal lightdm does not show the nice pictures\n'
p8260
aS'[13:43] <BluesKaj> Hi folks\n'
p8261
aS'[13:43] <apachelogger> is because lightdm uses accountsservices or something which uses .face.icon\n'
p8262
aS'[13:43] <apachelogger> wheres all the kde stuff uses .face\n'
p8263
aS'[13:43] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'
p8264
aS"[13:43] <shadeslayer> well .. it's face.icon now\n"
p8265
aS'[13:43] <shadeslayer> which is all that matters\n'
p8266
aS'[13:43] <apachelogger> all good then\n'
p8267
aS'[13:43] <apachelogger> hooray for standards\n'
p8268

Therefore if you have two users, they can each save files here, etc. Likewise, when copying files from devices, the files will be set to be owned by the "users" group."\n'

p8358
aS"[06:14] <rick_timmis> Riddell: I'm at my desk all day today, give me a nudge when your about.\n"
p8359
aS'[06:44] <jackyalcine> Good luck guys, with the KF5 porting and what not.\n'
p8360
aS'[06:44] <jackyalcine> Looks like a hurdle.\n'
p8361
aS'[06:47] <shadeslayer> not exactly\n'
p8362
aS"[06:47] <shadeslayer> there'll be loads of spluts\n"
p8363
aS'[06:47] <shadeslayer> *splits\n'
p8364
aS"[06:47] <shadeslayer> so that's going to be a PITA to manage\n"
p8365
aS'[07:17] <jackyalcine> I read somewhere how the splitting might make it more convinent for devs to come and work on specific modules\n'
p8366
aS"[07:17] <jackyalcine> but how the versioning of KDE altogether wouldn't change.\n"
p8367
aS'[07:17] <jackyalcine> how is that working out?\n'
p8368
aS'[07:19] <shadeslayer> true and true\n'
p8369
aS'[07:19] <shadeslayer> well ... the same as it works out right now?\n'
p8370
aS'[07:20] <shadeslayer> you release the SC together\n'
p8371
aS'[07:20] <shadeslayer> all components follow the release cycle etc\n'
p8372
aS'[07:24] <jackyalcine> hm\n'
p8373
aS'[07:25] <jackyalcine> so just between you and me (and everyone else here, haha)\n'
p8374
aS'[07:25] <jackyalcine> would we ever see a KDE 5.0?\n'
p8375
aS"[07:29] <shadeslayer> jackyalcine: heh, there's no KDE 5.0\n"
p8376
aS'[07:29] <shadeslayer> meh versions\n'
p8377
aS"[07:29] <shadeslayer> there's KDE Frameworks 5\n"
p8378
aS'[07:30] <shadeslayer> the branding is getting mighty confusing now\n'
p8379
aS'[07:30] <shadeslayer> for eg. is there a difference between KDE SC and KDE Frameworks?\n'
p8380
aS'[07:48] <jackyalcine> yeah\n'
p8381
aS"[07:48] <jackyalcine> that's part of it\n"
p8382
aS'[07:48] <jackyalcine> is there any idea on how something like this would be patched up?\n'
p8383
aS'[07:48] <jackyalcine> wonder if Blue got something\n'
p8384
aS'[07:53] <shadeslayer> patched up?\n'
p8385
aS'[07:55] <shadeslayer> whut?\n'
p8386
aS'[08:08] <jackyalcine> lol sorry\n'
p8387
aS'[08:09] <jackyalcine> Like how would the (potential) branding issue be resolved (if it becomes too much of a problem).\n'
p8388
aS"[08:09] <jackyalcine> To be honest, time-related releases would be awesome. but it'd be weird jumping from KDE 4 to KDE 13 lol\n"
p8389
aS'[08:13] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p8390
aS"[08:13] <shadeslayer> well ... I don't know myself\n"
p8391
aS'[08:13] <shadeslayer> I know that KDE Frameworks is a set of modules\n'
p8392
aS'[08:13] <shadeslayer> so you can add a framework module ontop of Qt to get extra functionality\n'
p8393
aS"[08:13] <shadeslayer> but I don't know how it relates to KDE SC\n"
p8394
aS'[08:14] <shadeslayer> and as for KDE, after the branding change, it will always refer to the community\n'
p8395
aS"[08:18] <jackyalcine> that's the upside\n"
p8396
aS'[08:18] <jackyalcine> thanks for saturating my brain, shadeslayer\n'
p8397
aS'[08:18] <jackyalcine> :)\n'
p8398
aS'[08:18] <shadeslayer> glad to :P\n'
p8399
aS"[08:19] <shadeslayer> I'm reasonably certain that someone here can explain KDE SC vs FF if you stick around\n"

aS'[08:19] <shadeslayer> everyone is sleeping probably\n'
p8401
aS'[08:19] <Tm_T> shadeslayer: FF?\n'
p8402
aS'[08:19] <Tm_T> sleep?\n'
p8403
aS'[08:19] <shadeslayer> oh sorry\n'
p8404
aS'[08:19] <shadeslayer> Frameworks Five\n'
p8405
aS'[08:19] <shadeslayer> FF\n'
p8406
aS'[08:19] <Tm_T> ah not final fantasy\n'
p8407
aS'[08:20] <shadeslayer> not Firefox either\n'
p8408
aS'[08:20] <Tm_T> Firefox is Fx\n'
p8409
aS'[08:20] <shadeslayer> oic\n'
p8410
aS"[08:20] <Tm_T> atleast that's how their FAQ said some years ago (:\n"
p8411
aS'[08:21] <Tm_T> anyway, frameworks are technology you build on your user level software, for example KDE sc\n'
p8412
aS'[08:21] <shadeslayer> hm, I thought it was the other way around\n'
p8413
aS'[08:21] <shadeslayer> KDE SC builds ontop of FF\n'
p8414
aS'[08:22] <shadeslayer> oh wait\n'
p8415
aS"[08:22] <shadeslayer> that's what you said :P\n"
p8416
aS'[08:23] <jackyalcine> lol I was thinking Fantastic Four\n'
p8417
aS'[08:23] <shadeslayer> Funky Funk\n'
p8418
aS'[08:23] <shadeslayer> KDE should name a release : KDE Funky Funk\n'
p8419
aS'[08:23] <shadeslayer> and go all retro\n'
p8420
aS"[08:23] <Tm_T> let's redo KDE 2 ?\n"
p8421
aS"[08:24] <Tm_T> oh wait that's almost what some people are demanding on certain development channels in time to time\n"
p8422
aS'[08:24] <shadeslayer> I have a Kubuntu 8.04 CD lying around somewhere\n'
p8423
aS'[08:24]  * shadeslayer rages at ubuntu\n'
p8424
aS'[08:24] <Tm_T> shadeslayer: I should have Ubuntu cds all the way from 5.04 if not 4.10 too\n'
p8425
aS'[08:25] <shadeslayer> it cannot run in a VM with 2GB of memory\n'

p8431
aS'[10:15] <hrw> hi\n'
p8432
aS'[10:15] <hrw> does someone here use more then 1 monitor with kde?\n'
p8433
aS'[10:16] <Riddell> hrw: yes\n'
p8434
aS'[10:16] <hrw> Riddell: is there a way to really get kde to remember their setup?\n'
p8435
aS'[10:17] <hrw> Riddell: here, never mind what I set in systemsettings, I end with clone\n'
p8436
aS'[10:17] <hrw> instead of HDMI0:auto DVI0: right of HDMI0 rotate: left\n'
p8437
aS"[10:18] <Riddell> hrw: yes, ignore the current tool it's pretty messy and install kscreen from https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/experimental\n"
p8438
aS'[10:18] <hrw> thanks\n'
p8439
aS'[10:18] <Riddell> it needs testers and afiestas is awaiting your feedback (also package reviews to get it into the archive)\n'
p8440
aS'[10:19] <hrw> ok\n'
p8441
aS'[10:19] <hrw> if this will not work I will revert to good old style: xorg.conf\n'
p8442
aS'[10:20] <Riddell> hardcore\n'
p8443
aS'[10:20] <hrw> but works always\n'
p8444
aS'[10:22] <hrw> ok. tested\n'
p8445
aS'[10:23] <hrw> looks like xorg.conf needs to go - radeon driver dislike rotating screen in working x11 session\n'
p8446
aS"[10:23] <allee> Riddell: about kscreen: there at least one issue left: what to do about the 'conflikt' with the old screen management module in kded4. \n"
p8447
aS'[10:24] <allee> What has to be done is described in README.debian\n'
p8448
aS"[10:24] <allee> AFAIR fedora splittet the old monitor module into it's own pkg and conflicts with it\n"
p8449
aS'[10:24] <hrw> afiestas: please add clear information which way screen is rotated.\n'
p8450
aS"[10:25] <Riddell> allee: yes that's what I'm thinking\n"
p8451
aS'[10:25] <hrw> as "thick line at side of screen" tells me nothing\n'
p8452
aS"[10:25] <allee> allee: mhmm or we divert the old module 'away'\n"
p8453
aS"[10:25] <hrw> afiestas: 'identify screens' icon is low res and not intuitive\n"
p8454
aS'[10:26] <hrw> afiestas: also there is no info when screens are not snapped. \n'
p8455
aS'[10:28] <hrw> afiestas: or if I want to have left in landscape (1920x1080) while right rotated (1080x1920) and snapped in the middle\n'
p8456
aS'[10:29] <hrw> afiestas: also buttons to enable/disable screens are non-standard\n'
p8457
aS'[10:31] <yofel__> afiestas: one thing that happened to be with kscreen: Turn external monitor off, wait 1s, turn it on again while kscreen is still auto-adjusting. What I got was a screen on my external monitor with the size of my notebook screen and the notebook screen was black\n'
p8458
aS'[10:31] <yofel__> s/to be/to me/\n'
p8459
aS'[10:31] <kubotu> yofel__ meant: "afiestas: one thing that happened to me with kscreen: Turn external monitor off, wait 1s, turn it on again while kscreen is still auto-adjusting.

p8462
aS'[10:32] <afiestas> yofel__: report bugs\n'
p8463
aS'[10:33] <yofel__> will do later\n'
p8464
aS'[10:33] <hrw> but firs thave to get xorg.conf written\n'
p8465
aS'[10:38] <hrw> ok, restart kdm\n'
p8466
aS'[10:50] <hrw> afiestas: it works!\n'
p8467
aS'[10:52] <hrw> afiestas: where to report bugs against kscreen?\n'
p8468
aS'[11:01] <afiestas> hrw: usual place\n'
p8469
aS'[11:02] <hrw> afiestas: you mean /dev/null?\n'
p8470
aS'[11:03] <afiestas> hrw: bugs.kde.org\n'
p8471
aS'[11:03] <hrw> so same place\n'
p8472
aS'[11:05] <afiestas> hrw: saying that bugs.kde.org is dev/null at least in my case is insulting, I spend many hours triaging bugs\n'
p8473
aS'[11:05] <afiestas> so please, if you want to give feedback do so via bugzilla, if you do not want then do nothing and wait to things to get fixed\n'
p8474
aS'[11:05] <hrw> afiestas: sorry for that but most of bugs I reported there stayed there\n'
p8475
aS"[11:05] <afiestas> so what? that's not excuse\n"
p8476
aS'[11:05] <afiestas> we mostly develop shit in our free time doing the best you can\n'
p8477
aS'[11:06] <afiestas> the very least you can do is report bugs and try to do your best as we do\n'

p8482
aS'[11:43] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: yes\n'
p8483
aS'[11:43] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: it seems the patches in the tomboy-blogposter 0.4.4 is not needed can you confirm that\n'
p8484
aS'[11:44] <shadeslayer> I have no idea what that package is\n'
p8485
aS'[11:44] <shadeslayer> but have you checked if they were applied upstream?\n'
p8486
aS'[11:44] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the make files are changes and there is not makefile in the source dir\n'
p8487
aS'[11:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the changelog says the build system is moved to automake, but building fails because of the missing makefile\n'
p8488
aS'[11:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  i think the problem is something else\n'
p8489
aS'[11:48] <shadeslayer> seems like they were applied upstream\n'

aS'[11:49] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: just from reading the changelog, that sounds right\n'
p8494
aS'[11:49] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: there is something else in the log, i will take a look at it.\n'

aS'[13:27] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: do I have to do anything after creating a path?\n'
p8633
aS'[13:27] <vassie> Riddell: hello\n'

aS'[13:28] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: http://paste.kde.org/659066/\n'
p8635
aS'[13:28] <Riddell> vassie: so I think we have some options with Cantata, we can just upload it, or we can patch out that first run dialogue I find so annoying\n'
p8636
aS'[13:29] <vassie> Riddell: sweet, being in "users" does have its benefits\n'
p8637
aS'[13:29] <vassie> Riddell: if you have multiple users on your system\n'
p8638
aS'[13:29] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: no\n'
p8639
aS'[13:29] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'
p8640
aS'[13:30] <apachelogger> https://projects.kde.org/projects/kdesupport/phonon/phonon/repository/revisions/master/entry/phonon/videoplayer.cpp#L60\n'
p8641
aS"[13:30] <Riddell> vassie: are you sure? cos I don't see the directories where that helps\n"
p8642
aS"[13:30] <apachelogger> phonon is free software don't you know\n"
p8643
aS'[13:30] <vassie> Riddell: i only have one user, plus i run MPD as myself so i don\'t need to add myself to "users"\n'
p8644
aS"[13:31] <shadeslayer> then I'm not sure what's missing\n"
p8645
aS'[13:31] <vassie> Riddell: if you set cantata to download album covers and lryics they will be owned by the "users" group\n'
p8646
aS'[13:31] <vassie> Riddell: but on my system MPD runs as "ben" and my .mpd folder is owned by "ben:ben"\n'
p8647
aS'[13:31] <yofel__> vassie: the "users" group doesn\'t exist by default in ubuntu though - and if someone wants to see the files they can just add that uses to their user group\n'
p8648
aS'[13:31] <shadeslayer> my webcam does turn on though\n'
p8649
aS'[13:32] <vassie> Riddell: so being in "users" does not apply, i just tick the "do not show" option and carry on\n'
p8650
aS'[13:32] <vassie> Riddell: i know, it is a weird one, plus the fact it was written on Kubuntu\n'
p8651
aS'[13:34] <Riddell> yofel__: it does seem to exist by default\n'
p8652
aS"[13:34] <yofel__> ah, then it's just not used the old way\n"
p8653
aS'[13:34] <vassie> Riddell: by the way, was my Quantal package OK?\n'
p8654
aS"[13:35] <Riddell> vassie: dunno I'm on raring, I'm hopeing BluesKaj will test it\n"
p8655
aS"[13:35] <vassie> yofel__: it's more an informational message, just a shame it pops up on first run, might scare some people\n"
p8656
aS"[13:36] <yofel__> yeah, it's a bit like that missing folder warnings that akonadi gave in the past because kdepim didn't set itself up properly\n"
p8657
aS'[13:36] <vassie> Riddell: i think i have the wrong email in quantal copyright <ben@unknown>, can it be changed or do i have to build it again?\n'
p8658
aS"[13:37] <Riddell> you'd have to build it again, but it's not very important\n"
p8659
aS'[13:37] <vassie> Riddell: ok, it does also have my correct email\n'
p8660
aS'[13:37] <Riddell> vassie: oh it needs a watch file\n'
p8661
aS'[13:38] <vassie> Riddell: ?\n'
p8662
aS'[13:38] <Riddell> a file which points at a webpage so automated programmes can look for new releases\n'
p8663
aS'[13:38] <vassie> Riddell: ok, how do i do that?\n'
p8664
aS'[13:39] <Riddell> find a package with a watch file and copy it :)\n'
p8665
aS'[13:40] <Riddell> man uscan   has the format\n'
p8666
aS'[13:40] <shadeslayer> ...\n'
p8667
aS'[13:40] <Riddell> maybe look at owncloud (first example I happened to look in)\n'
p8668
aS"[13:40] <shadeslayer> it's using the Qt videowidget\n"
p8669
aS'[13:41] <vassie> does this mean i need to rebuild both packages?\n'
p8670
aS"[13:43] <BluesKaj> why am I not part of the users group , that makes no sense , I'm the only user , and user management keeps crashing so i can't add my self as a user anyway\n"
p8671
aS'[13:44] <Riddell> vassie: no you can just give me the final packaging and I can upload it\n'
p8672
aS'[13:44] <BluesKaj> guess cantata testing will ahve to wait\n'
p8673
aS'[13:44] <vassie> from the dev "When cantata downloads images, or lyrics, and these are saved into the MPD folders - if the user is a member of the "users" group, the files will be set to belong to this group. Therefore if you have two users, they can each save files here, etc. Likewise, when copying files from devices, the files will be set to be owned by the "users" group."\n'
p8674
aS'[13:45] <vassie> it makes sense, but not needed if you only have one user\n'
p8675
aS'[13:45] <vassie> Riddell: re: watch file, still working our what i have to do :S\n'
p8676
aS"[13:45] <Riddell> it makes sense I'm just not convinced it's true\n"
p8677
aS"[13:46] <Riddell> vassie: it's faffy yes\n"
p8678
aS'[13:46] <vassie> if you had two users that shared a folder that contained music, if user1 and user2 are both a member of "users", then album art, etc that is downloaded by cantata would be viewable by both\n'
p8679
aS'[13:46] <vassie> but like i said, not needed if you only have one user\n'
p8680
aS'[13:47] <vassie> its a shame the app pops up that message\n'
p8681
aS'[13:47] <Riddell> I\'m curious why /var/lib/mpd/ is owned by the "audio" group\n'
p8682
aS"[13:47] <Riddell> vassie: if you think it's best to get rid of it then it's a simple patch\n"
p8683
aS"[13:47] <vassie> i'm not sure either, but i run mpd locally, so i don't even need those folder\n"

p8687
aS'[13:49] <vassie> Riddell: mpd is fine if you run as yourself :)\n'
p8688
aS"[13:50] <vassie> cantata is just a front end, you don't even need mpd, i use it to control mpd on my pi\n"
p8689

aS"[13:53] <BluesKaj> not connected to localhost , port 6600 ? what's that about , for streaming?\n"

p8697
aS'[14:02] <BluesKaj> vassie, which mpd-client is recommended?\n'
p8698
aS'[14:03] <vassie> you can use whatever client you like http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients\n'
p8699
aS'[14:03] <vassie> sonata is very popular but that is a gtk app\n'
p8700
aS"[14:04] <BluesKaj> well, I don't know what I like , what do you use ?\n"
p8701
aS'[14:04] <BluesKaj> vassie, I have no idea abou these mpd clientrs \n'
p8702
aS'[14:05] <vassie> i like cantata, but there is no deb for it\n'
p8703
aS'[14:07] <vassie> mpd can be installed wherever you like, for example i have it installed on my pi and my desktop, you then install any client to control it, i have canata on my laptop and desktop and mpdroid on my nexus 7\n'
p8704
aS'[14:07] <vassie> i can then control the what my desktop and pi plays\n'
p8705
aS'[14:07] <vassie> but again, you can use whatever client you like\n'

aS'[09:37] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thats a vulnerability :) \n'
p8968
aS'[09:38] <shadeslayer> I know :)\n'
p8969
aS'[09:38] <shadeslayer> the biggest risk is my ssh and gpg keys, which do not have a backup\n'
p8970
aS'[09:38] <shadeslayer> primarily because I have no good way to back them up\n'
p8971
aS'[09:38] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: "donot ask password" for screen locker is not working?\n'
p8972
aS'[09:38] <shadeslayer> whut\n'
p8973
aS'[09:41] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: is the new screen locker working for you?\n'
p8974
aS'[09:41] <shadeslayer> sure\n'
p8975
aS'[09:41] <shadeslayer> ctrl-alt-l locks the screen\n'
p8976
aS"[09:41] <shadeslayer> that's about all I tested\n"
p8977
aS'[09:41] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: does it ask for the password everytime?\n'
p8978
aS'[09:41] <shadeslayer> well\n'
p8979
aS"[09:42] <shadeslayer> that's intended behaviour\n"
p8980
aS'[09:42] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: no\n'
p8981
aS'[09:42] <shadeslayer> I specifically asked it to lock the screen, so it should ask my password\n'
p8982
aS'[09:42] <shadeslayer> what else would it do\n'
p8983
aS'[09:43] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: "the option require password after" is disabled for me and it asks for the password after i immediately try to unlock \n'
p8984
aS'[09:43] <phoenix_firebrd> let me confirm it one more time\n'
p8985
aS'[09:44] <shadeslayer> where is this option? 0..o\n'
p8986
aS'[09:44] <yofel_> screensaver\n'
p8987
aS'=== yofel_ is now known as yofel\n'
p8988
aS'[09:44] <phoenix_firebrd> screen locker\n'
p8989
aS'[09:45] <yofel> oh, they renamed the menu\n'
p8990
aS'[09:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: inside display and monitor settings\n'
p8991
aS'[09:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i am using 12.10\n'
p8992
aS'[09:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: hi\n'
p8993
aS'[09:45] <yofel> hey\n'
p8994
aS'[09:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: today 4.10 sc tagging?\n'
p8995
aS'[09:46] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: anyway, I did notice there was somthing funky about that menu\n'
p8996
aS'[09:46] <shadeslayer> I have no idea where this kcm is\n'
p8997
aS'[09:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: menu?\n'
p8998
aS'[09:46] <shadeslayer> give me the kcm module name\n'
p8999
aS"[09:46] <yofel> shadeslayer: no idea, but it's in the display settings \n"
p9000
aS'[09:46] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: can the see the display and monitor settings?\n'
p9001
aS'[09:47] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: well, that was the screensaver kcm before\n'
p9002
aS'[09:47] <shadeslayer> this ? http://i.imgur.com/BHRRto0.png\n'
p9003
aS'[09:47] <yofel> right\n'
p9004
aS'[09:47] <yofel> disable the 2nd checkbox\n'
p9005
aS'[09:47] <yofel> I think it has no effect\n'
p9006
aS'[09:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thats it\n'
p9007
aS"[09:47] <yofel> or at least it doesn't work reliably\n"
p9008
aS'[09:47] <shadeslayer> funny thing\n'
p9009
aS'[09:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the second options is the one i am talking about\n'
p9010
aS'[09:47] <shadeslayer> click "Screen Saver"\n'
p9011
aS'[09:47] <yofel> but I know they fixed a bunch of locker issues recently\n'
p9012
aS'[09:48] <shadeslayer> and the monitor turns blue\n'
p9013
aS'[09:48] <shadeslayer> click "Simple locker" and it stays blue\n'
p9014
aS'[09:48] <yofel> true o.O\n'
p9015
aS'[09:48] <shadeslayer> heheh\n'
p9016
aS'[09:48] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-cvs-announce/2013/000105.html\n'
p9017
aS'[09:48] <shadeslayer> iirc tagging freeze is in effect no?\n'
p9018
aS'[09:48] <yofel> so work starts tomorrow\n'
p9019
aS"[09:49] <yofel> I'll fire the cronjob up later for the stats\n"
p9020
aS'[09:49] <yofel> it is\n'
p9021
aS'[09:49] <yofel> shadeslayer: but who cares about it?\n'
p9022
aS'[09:49] <shadeslayer> well\n'
p9023
aS'[09:49] <shadeslayer> tsdegos got pissed when I merged to okular extractor\n'
p9024
aS"[09:49] <shadeslayer> so I'm not going to piss him off again :P\n"
p9025
aS"[09:49] <shadeslayer> I'll just file a bug\n"
p9026
aS'[09:49] <yofel> heh\n'
p9027
aS'[09:50] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9028
aS'[09:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: In case my project is using automake i wont be needing to add rules for clean, build and install in debian/rules right?\n'
p9029
aS"[09:56] <yofel> ok wait, I'll elaborate on that\n"
p9030
aS'[09:57] <yofel> you know how gnu make works? (roughly?)\n'
p9031
aS'[09:57] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: cmake configures with the make files and make buuilds the project with that\n'
p9032
aS'[09:57] <shadeslayer> what was the Product for the screenlocker again :|\n'
p9033
aS'[09:57] <phoenix_firebrd> :)\n'
p9034
aS'[09:57] <yofel> shadeslayer: kscreensaver I believe\n'
p9035
aS'[09:58] <shadeslayer> thx\n'
p9036
aS"[09:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: ok, so let's talk about make first\n"
p9037
aS'[09:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p9038
aS"[09:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: make is originally meant for building source code. It's usefullness comes from being able to determine what files have changed and only rebuilding what needs to be built\n"
p9039
aS'[09:59] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9040
aS'[09:59] <yofel> it does that by defining make "targets" that have dependencies and commands that are needed to build it\n'
p9041
aS'[09:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: wait\n'
p9042
aS'[09:59] <phoenix_firebrd> targets is key waord?\n'
p9043
aS'[10:00] <phoenix_firebrd> targets is key word?\n'
p9044
aS'[10:00] <yofel> no\n'
p9045
aS'[10:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the output?\n'
p9046
aS'[10:00] <yofel> a target is something like:\n'
p9047
aS'[10:00] <yofel> targetname: dep\n'
p9048
aS'[10:00] <yofel>                   commandlist\n'
p9049
aS'[10:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: give me an example\n'
p9050
aS'[10:01] <shadeslayer> done, kde bug 314122\n'
p9051
aS'[10:01] <ubottu> KDE bug 314122 in locker "Monitor is not turned \'off\'" [Normal,Confirmed] http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=314122\n'
p9052
aS'[10:01] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: http://paste.kde.org/659828\n'
p9053
aS'[10:02] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so to build the "build" target, the configure target has to be finished\n'
p9054
aS'[10:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p9055
aS'[10:03] <yofel> now, the reason I run "touch" there, is because usually the targets are the filenames of the source you want to build\n'
p9056
aS"[10:03] <yofel> so if a file changes, it's target and all targets that depend on it will run\n"
p9057
aS"[10:03] <yofel> that's how make works... roughly\n"
p9058
aS'[10:03] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: doubt\n'
p9059
aS'[10:03] <yofel> hm?\n'
p9060
aS'[10:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: if you say that this is the label that points to build "build:" then what does this do "DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET:" ?\n'
p9061
aS"[10:05] <yofel> what's DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET?\n"
p9062
aS'[10:05] <yofel> just going by make syntax, DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET would be the name of the target\n'
p9063
aS'[10:06] <yofel> i.e. the name would literally be "DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET"\n'
p9064
aS'[10:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can you pulll-lp tomboy-blogposter\n'
p9065
aS"[10:07] <yofel> oh, :=, that's a variable definition, but we'll come to that ^ example in a bit\n"
p9066
aS'[10:07] <yofel> now back to rules\n'
p9067
aS"[10:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok'\n"
p9068
aS'[10:08] <shadeslayer> hehehe\n'
p9069
aS'[10:08] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/pro/grannies.pdf\n'
p9070
aS"[10:08] <yofel> shadeslayer: o.O (I'll read it later...)\n"
p9071
aS'[10:09] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: in US too?\n'
p9072
aS"[10:09] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: it's a worldwide phenomenon\n"
p9073
aS'[10:09] <phoenix_firebrd> ha ha ha\n'
p9074
aS'[10:09] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so, as making deb packages is a slighly complex process, we have a program called debhelper with perl scripts called dh_* that does most of the work for us\n'
p9075
aS'[10:09] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9076
aS'[10:10] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: back in dh 6 and early 7 days, a rules file would look like this: http://paste.kde.org/659858\n'
p9077
aS'[10:10]  * shadeslayer is scared to click that link\n'
p9078
aS'[10:10] <yofel> which is gnu make taken too perfection\n'
p9079
aS'[10:10] <shadeslayer> oh heh\n'
p9080
aS"[10:10] <yofel> shadeslayer: it's a clean rules file, nothing scary ;)\n"
p9081
aS'[10:10] <shadeslayer> btw you should show him a cdbs file\n'
p9082
aS"[10:10] <yofel> shadeslayer: that's next\n"
p9083
aS'[10:10] <shadeslayer> :D\n'
p9084
aS'[10:10] <yofel> shadeslayer: as his example above uses that :P\n'
p9085
aS'[10:11] <shadeslayer> I joined just as cdbs was dying\n'
p9086
aS'[10:11] <shadeslayer> trolololol\n'
p9087
aS"[10:11] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so, as you can see it's not really the most easiest, not the most readable way of doing it\n"
p9088
aS'[10:11] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: + you had to be very careful to not mistake the sequencing\n'
p9089
aS'[10:11] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: to help with that people went and wrote supplementary build systems, like cdbs\n'
p9090
aS'[10:12] <phoenix_firebrd> came across that\n'
p9091
aS"[10:12] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: if you look at your tomboy rules, you'll see that it has include /usr/share/cdbs/1/rules/...\n"
p9092
aS'[10:12] <yofel> so it uses cdbs\n'
p9093
aS'[10:12] <shadeslayer> ScottK: your sync is bad : https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pyside/1.1.2-1\n'
p9094
aS'[10:12] <phoenix_firebrd> wait, checking\n'
p9095
aS'[10:12] <shadeslayer> makes pyside completely disappear for some reason\n'
p9096
aS'[10:12] <yofel> the advantage: the sequencing is done in the build system, and you just have to set some configuration variables like DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET\n'
p9097
aS'[10:13] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: which makes rules a lot simpler as you can see\n'
p9098
aS'[10:14] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9099
aS'[10:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: where to specify the type of build system/version i am using\n'
p9100
aS'[10:15] <yofel> by "include"-ing the buildsystem makefile you want to use\n'
p9101
aS'[10:15] <yofel> now, next\n'
p9102
aS'[10:15] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9103
aS'[10:16] <yofel> since debhelper 7.0.51 or whatever, debhelper got it\'s own auto-sequencer called "dh", which is what\'s most people use today\n'
p9104
aS'[10:16] <jussi> argh\n'
p9105
aS'[10:17] <phoenix_firebrd> those are perl scripts right?\n'
p9106
aS'[10:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ^\n'
p9107
aS'[10:17] <yofel> ah wait, a bit of clarification\n'
p9108
aS'[10:17] <jussi> consistent LO crashing, and calligra screws up the formatting :(\n'
p9109
aS'[10:17] <yofel> even cdbs used those scripts\n'
p9110
aS"[10:17] <yofel> it's just the content of the makefile that you saw above ^\n"
p9111
aS"[10:18] <yofel> that was moved to the build system, so you don't need to write the build: install: etc. targets\n"
p9112
aS'[10:18] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9113
aS'[10:18] <yofel> debhelper provided the dh_install, dh_auto_configure, and whatever else scripts\n'
p9114
aS'[10:18] <yofel> and it does today too\n'
p9115
aS'[10:19] <yofel> with dh7, we gained a "dh" script, which does the sequencing of the rules file inside debhelper\n'
p9116
aS"[10:19] <yofel> so most rules file's today look like this: http://paste.kde.org/659864\n"
p9117
aS'[10:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so if i am not using cdbs i dont need install: build: .. in rules ?\n'
p9118
aS"[10:19] <yofel> if you use cdbs you don't need it\n"
p9119
aS'[10:19] <yofel> the long rules example I showed above was a dh6 example without any build system\n'
p9120
aS'[10:20] <yofel> tomboy uses a cdbs file\n'
p9121
aS'[10:20] <yofel> http://paste.kde.org/659864 is modern dh7 style\n'
p9122
aS'[10:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the version 0.4.4 changed to automake so the rules have to be updated , probably the cdbs have to be removed\n'
p9123
aS'[10:20] <yofel> not really, cdbs and automake are 2 different thigns\n'
p9124
aS"[10:21] <yofel> for now I'm not going to talk about autotools\n"
p9125
aS'[10:21] <yofel> back to dh7\n'
p9126
aS'[10:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this is the min that has to be in the rules file for the new type http://paste.kde.org/659864  ?\n'
p9127
aS'[10:21] <shadeslayer> \\o/ objcopy:debian/firefox/usr/lib/firefox/libxul.so[.debug_info]: Memory exhausted\n'
p9128
aS"[10:22] <shadeslayer> I guess I'll just upload it to the PPA and fix\n"
p9129
aS'[10:22] <yofel> yes, unless you need adjustments for the package, that alone will already work\n'
p9130
aS'[10:22] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9131
aS'[10:22] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so, as you saw in the dh6 example, rules was a long list of dh_* commands\n'
p9132
aS'[10:23] <yofel> in dh7, "dh" runs those commands, so we don\'t need to write them ourselves\n'
p9133
aS'[10:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: dh6= http://paste.kde.org/659858/ ?\n'
p9134
aS'[10:23] <yofel> yes\n'
p9135
aS'[10:23] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9136
aS'[10:23] <yofel> now, if we need to tell one of those commands that we need to do something different\n'
p9137
aS'[10:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: overriding ?\n'
p9138
aS'[10:23] <yofel> like, dh_clean needs to remove a few more files\n'
p9139
aS"[10:24] <yofel> we'll override the command right\n"
p9140
aS'[10:24] <yofel> like this: http://paste.kde.org/659870\n'
p9141
aS'[10:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: who decides what to be put in ch_clean, the original maintainer or the packager?\n'
p9142
aS'[10:25] <shadeslayer> yay\n'
p9143
aS'[10:25] <shadeslayer> I have more bandwidth now\n'
p9144
aS'[10:25] <yofel> that essentially replaces the "dh_auto_clean" command in dh, with the list of commands inside the override target\n'
p9145
aS'[10:25] <shadeslayer> 2 Mbps\n'
p9146
aS'[10:25] <phoenix_firebrd> *dh_clean\n'
p9147
aS"[10:25] <yofel> (that's why you're calling dh_auto_clean there too)\n"
p9148
aS'[10:25]  * shadeslayer downloads shank\n'
p9149
aS'[10:26] <yofel> an empty override_dh_auto_clean: target would simply disable dh_auto_clean\n'
p9150
aS'[10:26] <yofel> (we often do that for dh_auto_test ;) )\n'
p9151
aS'[10:26] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9152
aS'[10:26] <phoenix_firebrd> junk is a user variable?\n'
p9153
aS'[10:26] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: any packager that works on the package may change the rules file as needed\n'
p9154
aS"[10:27] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: well, it's something, maybe the program makefile creates it. but dh_auto_clean has a fixed pattern that it deletes\n"
p9155
aS'[10:27] <yofel> so if you need to remove anything else you need to tell it to\n'
p9156
aS'[10:28] <phoenix_firebrd> junk is a keyword?\n'
p9157
aS"[10:28] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: for packaging, you're free to change what you want, but if the package has a maintainer that's not you, do talk to that person/team whether your changes are fine and ask for a review\n"
p9158
aS'[10:28] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: no, junk is a filename, this is literally "rm junk" in your shell\n'
p9159
aS'[10:28] <yofel> inside a make target you define simply shell commands\n'
p9160
aS'[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> oh ok\n'
p9161
aS'[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9162
aS"[10:29] <yofel> type dh_<tab><tab> in your shell, you'll see all of the debhelper stuff\n"
p9163
aS'[10:29] <yofel> as those are simply exectuable perl scripts\n'
p9164
aS'[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> checking\n'
p9165
aS'[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> got a list\n'
p9166
aS'[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> nice\n'
p9167
aS"[10:30] <yofel> ok, so that's the basics of rules that you see today, dh6 style is deprecated. If you don't need anything else use the simple dh7 style\n"
p9168
aS'[10:30] <phoenix_firebrd> so it is necessary to specify the debhelper version >=7  right?\n'
p9169
aS"[10:30] <yofel> if you still need something special that dh7 can't do, or is hard to use for, you another buildsystem\n"
p9170
aS'[10:31] <yofel> for example our KDE SC packages use the "dhmk" build system from pkg-kde-tools\n'
p9171
aS'[10:31] <phoenix_firebrd> what is script-kiddy?\n'
p9172
aS"[10:31] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: that, and you'll need to put the version of debhelper your packaging works with into debian/compat\n"
p9173
aS'[10:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: wait\n'
p9174
aS"[10:32] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: it's a script for translations stuff\n"
p9175
aS'[10:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p9176
aS'[10:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p9177
aS'[10:33] <phoenix_firebrd> what is debian/source/format for?\n'
p9178
aS'[10:33] <shadeslayer> read the manual :P\n'
p9179
aS'[10:33] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9180
aS'[10:34] <phoenix_firebrd> just this once, where can i specify the quilt version tghat i am using?\n'
p9181
aS"[10:34] <shadeslayer> you don't specify a quilt version\n"
p9182
aS'[10:34] <shadeslayer> quilt is version agnostic?\n'

p9185
aS'[10:35] <shadeslayer> can you grab me a quote?\n'
p9186
aS"[10:36] <yofel> er, you don't need to do that these days usually\n"
p9187
aS'[10:36] <phoenix_firebrd> thats it ,its the debian/source/format\n'
p9188
aS'[10:36] <shadeslayer> ahhh\n'
p9189
aS'[10:36] <yofel> there is one release that needs a manual quilt dep for 3.0 quilt and where lintian throws a warning if the version is missing\n'
p9190
aS'[10:36] <shadeslayer> okay so there are 2 formats, native and quilt\n'
p9191
aS'[10:36]  * yofel passes the micro to shadeslayer\n'

aS'[10:39] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: format of the source package\n'
p9203
aS"[10:39] <yofel> anyway, dpkg-source manpage explains all formats too. (ignore 2.0, that's not used)\n"

p9211
aS'[10:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: does your pbuilder check for updates everytime?\n'
p9212
aS'[10:47] <yofel> yes\n'
p9213
aS"[10:48] <yofel> if you're really low on bandwidth you can disable that\n"
p9214
aS'[10:48] <yofel> remove the executable bit from the 2 apt hooks\n'
p9215
aS'[10:48] <yofel> but then remember to keep your raring pbuilder updated\n'
p9216
aS'[10:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sure\n'
p9217
aS'[10:49] <apachelogger> yofel: do we have a kcm that is python3?\n'

aS'[11:04] <apachelogger> oh\n'
p9225
aS'[11:05] <apachelogger> yofel: got time to recompile pykde?\n'

p9228
aS"[11:20] <ovidiu-florin> hello world, I just received an update for jockey, and I was just curious, what's new in it? I think I remember seeing in the kubuntu devel mail list that jockey is to be replaced by something else. Is that true? If yes, how's that going?\n"

p9235
aS'[11:37] <ovidiu-florin> one sugestion: can it be implemented in the Kmenu, on the bottom right, next to the kubuntu logo to also say the kubuntu version? it would be a lot easier for new users to figure this out\n'
p9236
aS'[11:38] <vassie> Riddell: good morning\n'
p9237
aS'[11:40] <vassie> Riddell: been thinking about the cantata "not is users group" message, personally i think it should stay, being in that group does have it benefits, however if you don\'t want/need to be in it, tick the box and hide the message\n'
p9238
aS"[11:41] <Riddell> hi vassie, ok you're the packager :)\n"
p9239
aS'[11:41] <vassie> Riddell: :)\n'
p9240
aS"[11:42] <Riddell> ovidiu-florin: yes I'd be interested in something like that but probably not somewhere as intrusive as the kmenu\n"
p9241
aS'[11:42] <Riddell> vassie: did you look at a watch file?\n'
p9242
aS'[11:42] <vassie> Riddell: still not sure what to do with the watch file\n'
p9243
aS'[11:42] <Riddell> make one that points at the download page\n'
p9244
aS'[11:42] <vassie> and put it where?\n'
p9245
aS'[11:43] <vassie> is there an example of one i can use?\n'
p9246
aS'[11:43] <Riddell> vassie: I suggested owncloud\n'
p9247
aS'[11:44] <vassie> from the deb?\n'
p9248
aS'[11:44] <Riddell> apt-get source owncloud\n'
p9249
aS'[11:46] <vassie> ok, got it, do i need to modify it and rebuild my package?\n'
p9250
aS'[11:46] <Riddell> just a random suggestion though, you might want to look at a package which is hosted on google code\n'
p9251
aS'[11:46] <Riddell> modity it and test it :)\n'
p9252
aS'[11:47] <vassie> http://code.google.com/p/cantata/downloads/list\n'

aS'[11:47] <vassie> is there an example i can use?\n'
p9254
aS'[11:47] <Riddell> that looks like a good page\n'

aS'[11:53] <Riddell> vassie: tested it?\n'
p9261
aS'[11:53] <vassie> copy one from a program that was hosted on good code\n'
p9262
aS'[11:54] <vassie> how do i test?\n'
p9263
aS'[11:55] <Riddell> put it in a copy of the package sources and run uscan\n'
p9264
aS'[11:56] <vassie> k, need to power on my vm, might be on my desktop at home actually, this might take a while\n'
p9265
aS'[11:56] <Riddell> vassie: you can ask me for an ec2 if that helps\n'
p9266
aS'[11:57] <vassie> thanks, but will i have to build my package from scratch?\n'
p9267
aS"[11:57] <Riddell> vassie: you don't have to build anything, you just need the package source (which you can download from your PPA on launchpad)\n"
p9268
aS'[11:58] <BluesKaj> vassie, I have Cantata running ok , just have to configure mpd to startup at boot \n'
p9269
aS'[11:59] <vassie> got my source, added my current key to my ppa\n'
p9270
aS'[12:08] <vassie> ran uscan, nothing came back\n'
p9271
aS'[12:10] <Riddell> vassie: I get "uscan ERROR: debian/watch version number is unrecognised; skipping watchfile"\n'
p9272
aS"[12:10] <Riddell> so it doesn't like that one\n"

p9277
aS'[12:20] <shadeslayer> xnox: how do I make some code execute once a page has been loaded in ubiquity?\n'
p9278
aS'[12:20] <shadeslayer> i.e. once the event loop is running\n'
p9279
aS"[12:21] <xnox> shadeslayer: i'm not sure what you mean.\n"
p9280
aS'[12:21] <shadeslayer> well\n'
p9281
aS'[12:21] <shadeslayer> in order to get the devices Phonon needs an event loop running\n'
p9282
aS'[12:22] <Riddell> vassie: try kmediafactory maybe\n'
p9283
aS'[12:23] <vassie> i did, that is where i got it from\n'
p9284
aS"[12:24] <vassie> i changed 1 to 3 and i don't get an error now\n"
p9285
aS'[12:24] <Riddell> vassie: if you run uscan --verbose does it say useful things?\n'

p9288
aS'[12:25] <Riddell> vassie: so are we ready to upload?\n'
p9289
aS"[12:26] <vassie> i'm happy with it\n"
p9290
aS'[12:26] <vassie> :)\n'
p9291
aS'[12:26] <vassie> quantal and raring?\n'
p9292
aS'[12:26] <Riddell> just raring\n'
p9293
aS'[12:26] <Riddell> point me at the files to upload\n'
p9294
aS'[12:26] <vassie> can it be backported?\n'
p9295
aS'[12:27] <xnox> shadeslayer: right, but when event loop is running, that means python code is not executed sequentially any more, only callbacks are called.....\n'
p9296
aS'[12:27] <Riddell> yes, we can either put it into kubuntu-ppa/backports or once its in raring go through the proccess for the ubunut backports\n'
p9297
aS'[12:27] <vassie> Do you need my new cantata_0.9.2-0ubuntu3~ubuntu12.10~ppa1.debian.tar.gz?\n'
p9298
aS'[12:27] <vassie> and raring package?\n'
p9299
aS"[12:27] <xnox> shadeslayer: so in your __init__ or in your prepare funtions you need to setup callbacks that phonon will call if it finds or doesn't find a camera.\n"
p9300
aS'[12:28] <shadeslayer> okay\n'
p9301
aS'[12:29] <Riddell> vassie: yep\n'
p9302
aS'[12:29] <vassie> Riddell: ok, i need to sign them as i rebuilt my tar.gz, plus i need my raring VM, which is at home\n'
p9303
aS"[12:30] <Riddell> vassie: no you don't\n"
p9304
aS"[12:30] <Riddell> I need to sign them when I upload them, you don't have permission to upload to the ubuntu archive so your signature won't do anything\n"
p9305
aS'[12:30] <Riddell> vassie: just point me at what needs uploading\n'
p9306

p9341
aS"[13:04] <xnox> shadeslayer: look into run_main_loop / quit_main_loop. We stop mainloop between the pages, when we start mainloop again, you don't have any flow control at all. You are just hoping that an event/signal/handler is triggered by Qt and possible calls your callbacks.\n"
p9342
aS'[13:05] <shadeslayer> aha\n'
p9343
aS"[13:05] <xnox> shadeslayer: and you still didn't tell us what you are trying to achieve that brought you down the rabbit hole of main loops.\n"

p9347
aS'[13:06] <shadeslayer> to create a MediaSource?\n'
p9348
aS'[13:07] <xnox> (in gtk, widgets have on_realise callback, such that you can piggy back on to that to run some code when widgets are painted/actually created)\n'

p9350

aS'[14:50] <Riddell> we have more things needing an update for anyone interested, ktorrent and libmtp come to mind\n'
p9492
aS'[14:51] <jackyalcine> for raring?\n'
p9493
aS'[14:51] <Riddell> jackyalcine: yep\n'
p9494
aS"[14:54] <jackyalcine> smartboyhw: you're looking at libmtp or ktorrent?\n"
p9495
aS'[14:55] <ScottK> ktorrent also has a libktorrent update that goes with it.\n'
p9496
aS'[14:55] <ScottK> See Debian experimental.\n'
p9497
aS'[14:57] <Riddell> jackyalcine: take your pick I think\n'
p9498
aS'[14:59] <smartboyhw> jackyalcine, your pick:P\n'
p9499
aS"[15:02] <jackyalcine> ScottK: I'd have to peek at the upstream packaging for ktorrent before making any changes?\n"
p9500
aS'[15:03] <Riddell> jackyalcine: you should always check debian first for updates\n'
p9501
aS'[15:03] <Riddell> ktorrent is just a sync I think so check they have the newer version and file a sync bug\n'
p9502
aS'[15:03]  * smartboyhw feels happy that at least the amd64 and i386 builds for rekonq is built successfully\n'
p9503
aS'[15:04] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I think libmtp is also a sync bug.....\n'
p9504
aS'[15:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, the newest version is already there in Raring, no need for libmtp updates I think\n'
p9505
aS'[15:05] <BluesKaj> so updating/upgrading will bring the fixes into rekonq ?\n'
p9506
aS'[15:06] <BluesKaj> on raring\n'
p9507
aS'[15:07] <Riddell> smartboyhw: mm, then you might want to ask shadeslayer what he was on about when he asked :)\n'
p9508
aS'[15:07] <yofel> BluesKaj: well, 2.1 at least has a fixed history. I think they  fixed plenty of other things too\n'
p9509
aS"[15:10] <BluesKaj> yofel, let's hope the javascipt troubles were addressed\n"
p9510
aS'[15:13] <BluesKaj> nope , rekonq still freezes on some online game sites , stops loading after 15 secs or so \n'
p9511
aS'[15:14] <BluesKaj> then the javascript error pops up after a min or so\n'
p9512
aS'[15:15] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, you mean the 2.1 version?\n'
p9513
aS'[15:17] <BluesKaj> oops nope the 2.0 , smartboyhw\n'
p9514
aS'[15:17] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, LOL\n'
p9515
aS'[15:17] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, activate -proposed and you should be able to upgrade (unless you are using -armhf)\n'
p9516
aS'[15:19] <shadeslayer> no no no\n'
p9517
aS'[15:20] <shadeslayer> enabling proposed is a bad idea :P\n'
p9518
aS'[15:20] <BluesKaj> I was about to ask that question shadeslayer .;..had probs with it before\n'
p9519
aS'[15:21] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, what about libmtp? The newest version is there already;P\n'
p9520
aS"[15:22] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: right, but in general it'd be a good idea to have a look at the commits because for eg. my HTC One X is not supported from the last released version\n"

aS"[17:49] <yofel> officially, it's today at 23:59 UTC\n"
p9611
aS'[17:49] <yofel> so we should have the tars by tomorrow\n'
p9612
aS'[17:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so you will be working throught the night?\n'
p9613
aS'[17:51] <yofel> no\n'
p9614
aS'[17:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in that case will it be ok if i be here tomorrow 12 pm my time?\n'
p9615
aS"[17:53] <yofel> sure, you won't be able to help much anyway except watching as you don't have sufficient permissions yet to work on KDE\n"
p9616
aS"[17:53] <yofel> for that you'll have to convince Riddell that you're on ninja level first\n"
p9617
aS'[17:53] <phoenix_firebrd> ya, when will the process start, in your time\n'

p9620
aS'[17:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p9621
aS'[17:54] <yofel> but it depends when tsdgeos finished building the tars and then the first ninja to see the tars will get to work\n'
p9622
aS'[17:54] <phoenix_firebrd> ya, when will the process start?\n'
p9623
aS'[17:55] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'

p9627
aS'[17:56] <phoenix_firebrd> we can beat suse this time?\n'
p9628
aS'[17:56] <phoenix_firebrd> are they using cluster for building?\n'
p9629
aS"[17:57] <yofel> That's impossible to predict, but as we have a week we should at least be done in time\n"
p9630
aS"[17:57] <yofel> dunno, but we're building in parallel on launchpad too, it just takes a while\n"
p9631
aS'[17:57] <phoenix_firebrd> soon this will happen\n'
p9632
aS'[17:57] <yofel> and might need some manual work\n'
p9633
aS'[17:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'

aS'[17:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I will be here at 7: 30 am your time\n'

p9664
aS'[22:01]  * ScottK looks harder at Riddell.\n'
p9665
aS'[22:01] <apachelogger> looks like the size hinting of the grid there is broken\n'
p9666
aS'[22:01] <yofel> maybe because you removed the layout?\n'
p9667
aS'[22:01] <apachelogger> (assuming it is a grid ^^)\n'
p9668
aS'[22:01] <yofel> the ui file *had* <layout class="QGridLayout" name="gridLayout_8">\n'
p9669
aS'[22:02] <apachelogger> well, one can work without grids\n'
p9670
aS'[22:05] <yofel> well, now the radio buttons are simply inside a qwidget, whose preferred size here is 10\n'
p9671
aS'[22:06] <yofel> *preferred height\n'
p9672
aS'[22:10] <yofel> wtf?\n'
p9673
aS'[22:10] <yofel> Lay out > Lay out in a Grid; press ctrl+Z; -> it looks righ\n'
p9674
aS'[22:10] <yofel> t\n'
p9675
aS'[22:11] <apachelogger> designer files are a flipping mess\n'
p9676
aS"[22:14] <yofel> well, considering that widget already has fixed content widget sizes, setting a minimum Size wouldn't hurt I guess\n"
p9677
aS'[22:14] <yofel> feels like the wrong way to fix it though\n'
p9678
aS'[22:15] <apachelogger> depending on what the widget contains it may also be wrong\n'
p9679
aS'[22:15] <yofel> 2 radio buttons and one indented checkbox\n'
p9680
aS'[22:15] <apachelogger> does it contain text?\n'
p9681
aS"[22:16] <yofel> apachelogger: that's how it was intended: http://people.ubuntu.com/~yofel/pics/user_design1.png\n"
p9682
aS'[22:16] <apachelogger> yah, minimumsize is wrong though\n'
p9683
aS'[22:16] <apachelogger> as text labels have no fixed minimumsize\n'
p9684
aS'[22:17] <yofel> well, they do have set sizes in the ui file though\n'
p9685
aS'[22:17] <yofel> http://paste.kde.org/660974\n'
p9686
aS'[22:17] <apachelogger> yeah its to make sure the uis coming out of designer are as broken as possible\n'
p9687
aS'[22:18] <apachelogger> I reckon it should be a grid though\n'
p9688
aS'[22:18] <yofel> well, it was a grid, but how do you do the indenting? (except by adding a fixed spacer)\n'
p9689
aS"[22:19] <apachelogger> also to get perfect visual results regardless of the qt style/fontsize you'd want to have a radio underneith the other radio that is hidden\n"
p9690
aS"[22:19] <apachelogger> that's how you'd grid\n"
p9691
aS'[22:19] <yofel> o.O\n'
p9692
aS'[22:19] <apachelogger> (*) require the might login\n'
p9693
aS'[22:20] <apachelogger> ( ) [x] decrypt the awesome home\n'
p9694
aS'[22:20] <apachelogger> of course the second radio would be invis\n'
p9695
aS'[22:21] <yofel> hm, that kind of makes sense\n'
p9696
aS'[22:21] <apachelogger> the other option is to detach the text from the radio\n'
p9697
aS"[22:21] <apachelogger> i.e. (*) is the radio and 'require the might login' is a secondary label\n"
p9698
aS'[22:22] <apachelogger> (of course then you need to manually wire the stateness between those\n'
p9699
aS'[22:22] <apachelogger> also an option though\n'
p9700
aS'[22:22] <apachelogger> so you get \n'
p9701
aS'[22:22] <apachelogger> (*) | require the mighty login\n'
p9702
aS'[22:23] <apachelogger>     | [x] decrypt the awesome home\n'
p9703
aS'[22:23] <apachelogger> | representing a vertical layout border\n'
p9704
aS"[22:24] <apachelogger> oh and a third option that woudl be entirely code based ... you create a radiobutton without text, get it's size hint and set that as width&height of a spaceritem that is left of the checkbox\n"
p9705
aS'[22:25] <apachelogger> i.e. you have a temporary radio button that is not really used but that dictates what size the spacer needs to be\n'
p9706
aS'[22:27] <yofel> well, the hidden, button seems to work, except that you need to hide it in the code\n'

aS"[07:34] <yofel> shadeslayer: yeah, but that's because it's just for copying the override files\n"
p9837
aS"[07:34] <yofel> so that's ok\n"

p9843
aS"[07:40] <yofel> you don't say ;P\n"
p9844
aS'[07:40] <shadeslayer> hehe\n'
p9845
aS'[07:41] <yofel> kde-wallpapers is the new kdeartwork\n'

p9850
aS"[07:52] <yofel> note: we don't really care about the policy version usually\n"
p9851
aS'[07:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p9852
aS"[07:53] <yofel> the ubuntu-policy is still at 3.8.2, so that's all we really need to comply with\n"
p9853
aS'[07:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p9854
aS'[07:53] <yofel> knowing the policy is good though ;)\n'
p9855
aS'[07:53] <yofel> as we do try to follow it, we just rarely update that number\n'
p9856
aS'[07:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: it seems that the package is upto the standards, sahall i bump the standards version?\n'
p9857
aS"[07:54] <shadeslayer> please don't bump standards\n"
p9858
aS'[07:54] <shadeslayer> unnecessary diff\n'

aS'[07:54] <shadeslayer> from debian that is\n'
p9860
aS'[07:55] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: why did you ask me to take a look at the lintian error?\n'
p9861
aS'[07:55] <shadeslayer> because it needs fixing?\n'
p9862
aS'[07:56] <shadeslayer> without bumping the standards version\n'
p9863
aS'[07:56] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: why not?\n'
p9864
aS'[07:56] <yofel> ^\n'
p9865
aS'[07:56] <shadeslayer> because it makes merging from debian easier\n'
p9866
aS'[07:56] <yofel> well, merging 4.10 will be fun anyway - if debian ever gets to package it in time for us\n'
p9867
aS'[07:56] <yofel> lag -.-\n'
p9868
aS'[07:57] <shadeslayer> why do you want to bump the standards version?\n'
p9869
aS'[07:57] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok in that case the package is updated to the new standards and i wont bump the version number so the lintian warning will remain , whats next?\n'
p9870
aS'[07:58]  * yofel wonders if importing debian git packaging into bzr and merging that would work\n'
p9871
aS'[07:58] <yofel> probably not\n'
p9872
aS'[07:58] <shadeslayer> wat\n'
p9873

p9877
aS'[08:01] <shadeslayer> erm\n'
p9878
aS'[08:01] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: after updating the package standards, what should i do?\n'

p9907
aS'[08:11] <shadeslayer> mmm\n'
p9908
aS"[08:11] <shadeslayer> you'll have to request access\n"

p9923
aS"[08:20] <yofel> yeah, because you don't have the 4.10 one :/\n"
p9924
aS'[08:21] <yofel> or are you building 4.9.98?\n'
p9925
aS'[08:21] <yofel> in that case you would be missing a deb-src line\n'

p9945
aS'[08:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: 2.5.10.2\n'
p9946
aS'[08:47] <shadeslayer> can you check with 2.5.11?\n'
p9947
aS'[08:48]  * yofel as looking at the lintian changelog\n'

p9949
aS'[08:48] <shadeslayer> lol\n'

p9954
aS'[08:49] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p9955
aS'[08:51] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: yofel there is no amd64 build\n'
p9956
aS"[08:52] <shadeslayer> because it's an arch any package\n"
p9957
aS'[08:52] <shadeslayer> or was it arch all\n'
p9958
aS'[08:52] <yofel> all\n'
p9959
aS'[08:52] <shadeslayer> right\n'
p9960

p9961
aS'[08:52]  * yofel suggests s/all/indep/ -.-\n'
p9962
aS'[08:52] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: standards 3.9.3 has an update for that\n'
p9963
aS'[08:53] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: update for what?\n'
p9964
aS'[08:53] <yofel> then again, all makes some sense syntactically\n'
p9965
aS'[08:53] <shadeslayer> right\n'
p9966
aS'[08:53] <shadeslayer> yofel: it makes sense if you also know about any\n'
p9967
aS'[08:53] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: directions for using all or any for the arch\n'
p9968
aS'[08:53] <shadeslayer> okay, and?\n'
p9969
aS'[08:54] <shadeslayer> new symbols in kdelibs? :(\n'
p9970
aS'[08:55] <phoenix_firebrd> i am getting that error now\n'
p9971
aS'[08:56] <phoenix_firebrd> as yofel said i am going to remove the override files\n'
p9972
aS'[08:56] <shadeslayer> wait what\n'
p9973
aS'[08:58] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  "about that error, just bzr rm the override file. kfloppy has no dbg package"\n'
p9974
aS"[08:59] <shadeslayer> I don't see a override file\n"

aS'[08:59] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: me too\n'
p9976
aS'[08:59] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i am going to check for the configs\n'
p9977
aS'[08:59] <shadeslayer> ahh nvm\n'
p9978
aS'[09:00] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: drop debian/source/lintian-overrides\n'

p9983
aS'[09:03] <yofel> or phoenix_firebrd\n'
p9984
aS'[09:03] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p9985
aS'[09:03] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\n'

aS'[09:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sure\n'
p9987
aS"[09:04] <shadeslayer> I'm working on kde bits today\n"

aS'[09:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am following what you taught me\n'
p9995
aS'[09:06] <yofel> yeah, I did teach him how to do it\n'
p9996
aS"[09:07] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: sure, but it's not really needed if we're already talking here. Merge requests make sense for complex reviews and when the reviewer isn't at hand\n"

aS'[09:09] <yofel> no idea, first time I see it\n'
p10002

p10019
aS'[09:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i uploaded with a changelog, asked me to remove it\n'
p10020
aS'[09:14] <yofel> the reason lintian complains about a duplicate field, is because each chunk in the copyright file is seperated by an empty line\n'
p10021
aS'[09:15] <yofel> as the line is missing both license declarations belong to the same paragraph, which is invalid\n'
p10022
aS'[09:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats ok\n'
p10023
aS'[09:15] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: hm, the changelog was still there though\n'
p10024
aS'[09:15] <yofel> did you forget to push maybe?\n'
p10025
aS'[09:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: should i meantion the copyright file change in the changelog?\n'
p10026
aS'[09:16] <yofel> probably not worth it\n'
p10027
aS"[09:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so  i don't have to update the change log now right?\n"
p10028
aS'[09:17] <yofel> or it would be an entry like "* Fix <lintian_error_name>"\n'

aS'[09:24] <yofel> you changed the dch behaviour? (just curious)\n'
p10037
aS'[09:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya\n'
p10038
aS'[09:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so that debuild will sign\n'
p10039
aS'[09:24] <yofel> aaaaah\n'

aS'[09:24] <yofel> wait, I have a workaround for that\n'

p10042
aS'[09:25] <yofel> no\n'
p10043
aS'[09:25] <yofel> in ~/.devscripts put: DEBSIGN_KEYID=2EC0A9FF, except with your keyid instead of mine\n'
p10044
aS"[09:25] <yofel> that'll force it to use your key and ignore the changelog entry\n"
p10045
aS'[09:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p10046
aS"[09:26] <yofel> it's meant as a kind of safety measure, as you can always -us -uc and run debsing after that\n"

p10140
aS'[11:47] <vHanda> are you sure?\n'
p10141
aS'[11:48] <yofel> is that Private?\n'
p10142
aS"[11:48] <yofel> if it is then nevermind, but it doesn't obviously look private to me\n"
p10143
aS'[11:50] <apachelogger> vHanda: removing a private function always breaks ABI\n'
p10144
aS'[11:50] <apachelogger> the impact of it depends on other factors though (for example whether the class/function is virtual)\n'
p10145
aS'[11:51] <Riddell> you can "remove private non-virtual functions if they are not called by any inline functions (and have never been). " says http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Binary_Compatibility_Issues_With_C++\n'
p10146
aS'[11:52] <Riddell> that one is a "private Q_SLOTS:"\n'
p10147
aS"[11:52] <Riddell> so that's fine I think\n"
p10148
aS'[11:52] <apachelogger> it still breaks the ABI, it is however a binary compatible change\n'
p10149
aS"[11:53] <Riddell> is it ABI if it's a bit of the interface you can't use?\n"
p10150
aS'[11:53] <apachelogger> (the restrictedness of when it is a ok to remove a private is why one should generally avoid having privates)\n'
p10151
aS'[11:53] <apachelogger> Riddell: you can use it\n'
p10152
aS'[11:55] <apachelogger> ABI is really no philosophical topic :)\n'
p10153
aS'[11:55] <Riddell> hmm\n'
p10154
aS'[11:55] <apachelogger> BC is to some extent ^^\n'
p10155
aS"[11:55] <Riddell> anyway yofel you'll handle that?\n"
p10156
aS'[11:55] <apachelogger> Riddell: on the library level there is no difference between private and public\n'
p10157
aS'[11:55] <apachelogger> so I could link to the privates all the same\n'
p10158
aS"[11:56] <Riddell> '#define private public' is evil!\n"
p10159
aS'[11:56] <yofel> yeah, as soon as apachelogger is finished explaining...\n'
p10160
aS'[11:56] <apachelogger> actually let me speed this up\n'
p10161
aS'[11:56] <vHanda> yofel: Do you want me to add the private slot again?\n'
p10162
aS'[11:56] <apachelogger> whenever a binary interface disappears the change breaks ABI :P\n'
p10163
aS'[11:56] <apachelogger> whether that binary interface was from a private or not does not matter in that regard\n'
p10164
aS'[11:57] <apachelogger> </storymode>\n'
p10165
aS"[11:57] <Riddell> vHanda: no it's fine\n"
p10166
aS"[11:57] <vHanda> yofel: I'll have to run it by the release team\n"
p10167
aS'[11:57] <vHanda> oh\n'
p10168
aS'[11:57] <Riddell> apachelogger is just confusing matters!\n'
p10169
aS'[11:58] <yofel> ok, he did manage to confuse me at least\n'
p10170
aS"[11:58] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: how so? aren't privates not supposed to be exposed in the symbols file?\n"
p10171
aS"[11:58] <Riddell> yes the symbol has gone, no nothing uses it, so there's no problem\n"
p10172
aS'[11:58] <apachelogger> :(\n'
p10173
aS"[11:58] <apachelogger> Riddell: it's a library\n"
p10174
aS'[11:58] <apachelogger> the statement nothing uses it is simply wrong\n'
p10175
aS'[11:58] <yofel> so what would use it?\n'
p10176
aS'[11:58] <apachelogger> anything can use it so we must assume something uses it\n'
p10177
aS'[11:58] <yofel> outside of the library\n'
p10178
aS"[11:58] <shadeslayer> but if it's private, how can something use it?\n"
p10179
aS'[11:59] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: #define private public\n'
p10180
aS'[11:59] <apachelogger> #include <yourlib.h>\n'
p10181
aS'[11:59] <shadeslayer> bah\n'
p10182
aS'[11:59] <shadeslayer> if you do that\n'
p10183
aS'[11:59] <shadeslayer> then that\n'
p10184
aS'[11:59] <apachelogger> Foo foo; foo.yourprivates();\n'
p10185
aS"[11:59] <shadeslayer> then that's just shit \n"
p10186
aS'[11:59] <shadeslayer> and evil\n'
p10187
aS"[11:59] <vHanda> apachelogger: That's a neat trick. I didn't know you could do that!\n"
p10188
aS"[11:59] <yofel> I'm fairly certain we don't support *that*\n"
p10189
aS'[11:59] <apachelogger> it does not matter!\n'
p10190
aS'[11:59] <apachelogger> when talking about ABI any time you retract an interface it is breaking ABI\n'
p10191
aS'[12:00] <apachelogger> when talking about BC if you decided to link against a private then that is your fault\n'
p10192
aS"[12:00] <Riddell> vHanda: now you're just winding us up!\n"
p10193
aS'[12:00] <yofel> I think we can conclude that this is BC and go on with our lives\n'
p10194
aS'[12:00] <Riddell> yofel++\n'
p10195
aS'[12:01] <shadeslayer> *nod*\n'
p10196
aS'[12:01] <yofel> vHanda: so, sorry for the more or less false alarm\n'
p10197
aS"[12:01] <vHanda> uhm, okay. I'm still preparing a patch just in case someone else objects.\n"
p10198
aS"[12:02] <vHanda> The tarballs aren't going to get re-spun until monday\n"
p10199
aS'[12:02] <vHanda> so we have till then to decide if this should be fixed.\n'
p10200
aS'[12:03] <vHanda> http://paste.kde.org/661370\n'
p10201
aS'[12:04] <apachelogger> vHanda: btw, not sure if kde wants to use it but there is Q_PRIVATE_SLOT\n'
p10202
aS'[12:06] <apachelogger> it allows you to pass the slot call to the d ptr\n'
p10203
aS'[12:06] <apachelogger> and it expands to nothing in c++ so you end up having no symbol for the slot as the slot is entirely handled via the qmetaobject \n'
p10204
aS"[12:08] <Riddell> useful note: ec2's in ireland upload to launchpad much faster than those in the US\n"

aS'[13:53] <smartboyhw> Riddell, so nothing for me to "play" with now?\n'
p10276
aS'[13:54] <Riddell> smartboyhw: check what needs done on 4.10 http://yofel.dyndns.org/kubuntu/build_status_4.10.0_raring.html\n'
p10277
aS'[13:54] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I do see some build failures...\n'
p10278
aS'[13:54] <smartboyhw> No access to build logs though...\n'
p10279
aS'[13:54] <yofel> those should just be archive skew I belive (libkdeedu related)\n'
p10280
aS"[13:56] <Riddell> smartboyhw: oh I'll put you in the team\n"
p10281
aS'[13:56] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ooh?\n'
p10282
aS"[13:57] <Riddell> we're not precious about it :)   it's only hidden because upstream wants it hidden until release \n"
p10283
aS"[13:57] <yofel> Riddell: mind adding phonix_firebird too unless you think he needs more time? I'll tell him what not to do later then\n"

aS'[13:58] <smartboyhw> thx\n'
p10288
aS'[13:58] <Riddell> voila\n'
p10289
aS'[13:58] <yofel> thanks :)\n'
p10290
aS'[13:58] <smartboyhw> libkmajjongglib-dev failed...\n'
p10291
aS'[13:59] <yofel> archive skew, just retry the build\n'
p10292
aS'[13:59] <yofel> hm, having a link to the build from the status page would be nice...\n'
p10293
aS'[14:01] <smartboyhw> Weird, why is ksnakeduel i386 showing a failure, when the logs said it is perfectly built?\n'
p10294
aS'[14:02] <yofel> smartboyhw: list-missing should be empty\n'
p10295
aS'[14:02] <yofel> but in this case the output looks weird\n'
p10296
aS'[14:02] <smartboyhw> Lots of .png and .desktop files\n'
p10297
aS'[14:03] <yofel> wth\n'
p10298
aS'[14:04] <yofel> ah no, makes sense\n'
p10299
aS'[14:04] <yofel> smartboyhw: a transitional package was added which is only built on i386 as it\'s arch "all", but nobody added an install file for ksnakeduel\n'
p10300
aS'[14:05] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh should I add one?\n'
p10301
aS'[14:05] <yofel> so the package needs ksnakeduel.install with "usr/*" in it\n'
p10302
aS'[14:05] <yofel> smartboyhw: yeah, but please do so in bzr as well\n'
p10303
aS'[14:05] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK\n'
p10304
aS'[14:06] <smartboyhw> yofel, where is the branch?\n'
p10305
aS"[14:06] <yofel> smartboyhw: usually it's best to add it in bzr and generate the package from there\n"
p10306
aS'[14:06] <yofel> smartboyhw: do you have kubuntu-dev-tools installed?\n'
p10307
aS'[14:06] <yofel> then it\'s just \'kbzr co ksnakeduel"\n'
p10308
aS'[14:06]  * smartboyhw finds himself a total idiot today\n'

aS'[14:14] <smartboyhw> yofel, anyway got it now, syncing\n'

aS'[14:30] <smartboyhw> Or anything?\n'

aS'[14:34] <smartboyhw> yofel, when you mean commit you mean locally?\n'

aS'[14:34] <yofel> yeah, bzr builddeb will use uncomitted changes\n'

aS'[14:35] <yofel> ok, with new libkolabxml kdepim-runtime will only need a simple retry in a bit\n'

p10353
aS'[14:38] <smartboyhw> yofel, you mean for the ninja ppa?\n'
p10354

p10355
aS'[14:39] <smartboyhw> k\n'

p10357
aS'[14:40] <yofel> that will have the apt lines with your PPA password\n'

aS'[14:57] <shadeslayer> UTAH or sth like that\n'
p10369
aS'[14:57] <yofel> ah, all I remember is that they have a jenkins instance for some things\n'

aS'[15:25] <shadeslayer> yofel: question time btw\n'
p10399
aS'[15:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: are you free now?\n'
p10400
aS'[15:26] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: what time do you go to bed?\n'
p10401
aS"[15:26] <yofel> not too much, but a quick question's ok\n"
p10402
aS"[15:26] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: I don't think shadeslayer goes to bed\n"
p10403
aS'[15:26] <smartboyhw> yofel, ok\n'
p10404
aS'[15:26] <shadeslayer> :P\n'
p10405
aS'[15:26] <phoenix_firebrd> wow\n'
p10406
aS'[15:27] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so thats why the nick?\n'
p10407
aS"[15:27] <shadeslayer> it's quite random actually, anything between 10 PM to 5 AM\n"
p10408
aS'[15:27] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: my sleep cycle was like yours 1 month before, just had it reset\n'
p10409
aS'[15:27] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p10410
aS'[15:28] <Riddell> + [laney] get maliit in the archive: DONE\n'
p10411
aS'[15:28] <Riddell> ooh, well done Quintasan \n'
p10412
aS'[15:28] <shadeslayer> my sleep cycle changes every 2 weeks\n'
p10413
aS'[15:28] <yofel> what\n'

aS'[15:28] <shadeslayer> nice :)\n'
p10417
aS'[15:28] <Riddell> very generous of Quintasan to let laney take all the credit\n'

p10419
aS"[15:29] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i was observing the actives in this channel from the morning, I can't figure out the procedure of tagging \n"
p10420
aS'[15:29] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: tagging is meant as "create git tags in KDE svn/git and spin tarballs from that"\n'
p10421
aS'[15:29] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: mine shifts 1 hr everyday, delayed sleep syndrome\n'
p10422
aS'[15:29]  * shadeslayer looks that up\n'
p10423
aS'[15:30] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: the kde-release-team folks do that, we just get the tars after that\n'
p10424
aS'[15:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya, thats right\n'
p10425
aS'[15:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so did the tars are available for packaging?\n'
p10426
aS'[15:31] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: the 4.10.0 release is a week away, till then the release team may re-spin some tarballs if some bugfixes need to get in\n'
p10427
aS'[15:31] <yofel> pretty much\n'
p10428
aS'[15:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p10429
aS'[15:31] <yofel> actually, kdepim got recreated today for that reaosn\n'
p10430
aS'[15:31] <yofel> *reason\n'
p10431
aS'[15:31] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the argument about the ABI?\n'
p10432
aS"[15:31] <yofel> that's why you'll find kdepim 4.10.0a in the ppa as that's the only way for us to update it\n"
p10433
aS'[15:32] <yofel> no, that was something different\n'
p10434
aS'[15:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: if i am not mistaken the pim stuff is always problematic?\n'
p10435
aS'[15:33] <shadeslayer> heh no\n'
p10436
aS'[15:33] <yofel> well, a bit\n'
p10437
aS'[15:33] <yofel> shadeslayer: seems we disagree :P\n'
p10438
aS'[15:33] <shadeslayer> depends on what you call problematic :P\n'
p10439
aS'[15:33] <yofel> but maybe i just have a trauma from uploading kdepim 4.7\n'
p10440
aS'[15:33] <shadeslayer> I call it unusable xD\n'
p10441
aS'[15:33] <yofel> lol\n'
p10442
aS'[15:33] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i mostly see a known issue that saying about pim stuff\n'
p10443
aS'[15:33] <shadeslayer> I simply cannot import all of my email into KMail\n'
p10444
aS"[15:33] <yofel> well, it's not that bad, it just doesn't scale\n"
p10445
aS"[15:34] <shadeslayer> right, it doesn't scale\n"
p10446
aS"[15:34] <shadeslayer> it'll just take a batshit amount of time to import my email \n"
p10447
aS'[15:34] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: with respinning tars I mean this btw. http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/release-team/2013-January/006809.html\n'
p10448
aS'[15:34] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i like kdepim\n'
p10449
aS'[15:34] <yofel> oh right, talking about mailing lists\n'
p10450
aS'[15:35] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: my first patch was for akonadi backup\n'
p10451
aS"[15:35] <yofel> there's 2 that are relevant here: release-team@kde.org, which is mostly not interesting for us, but public. Then there's kde-packager@kde.org which is relevant to us but private to packagers\n"
p10452
aS'[15:35] <yofel> we need to get you added to the 2nd one eventually\n'
p10453
aS'[15:35] <yofel> same with smartboyhw\n'
p10454
aS"[15:35] <shadeslayer> actually the release team does get cc'd for the tars right?\n"
p10455
aS'[15:36] <shadeslayer> kde-packagers is mostly irrelevant from what I gathered at Akademy\n'
p10456
aS'[15:36] <yofel> yeah, tsdgeos always sends the mails to packager, release-team, and qa\n'
p10457
aS'[15:36] <yofel> it does feel a bit deprecated lately...\n'
p10458
aS'[15:36] <shadeslayer> it does have the odd interesting discussion ;)\n'
p10459
aS'[15:36] <shadeslayer> s/odd/occassional/\n'
p10460
aS'[15:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:should i join this now ? kde-packager@kde.org\n'
p10461
aS'[15:37] <kubotu> shadeslayer meant: "it does have the occassional interesting discussion ;)"\n'
p10462
aS"[15:37] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: you'll have to open a sysadmin bug report\n"
p10463
aS'[15:37] <shadeslayer> and ask Riddell to ack it\n'
p10464
aS'[15:37] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: am i qualified?\n'
p10465
aS'[15:38] <shadeslayer> qualified for what? reading emails? idk you tell me :D\n'
p10466
aS'[15:38] <yofel> release-team has more fun discussions lately\n'
p10467
aS'[15:38] <yofel> http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/release-team/2013-January/date.html\n'
p10468
aS'[15:38] <phoenix_firebrd> :D\n'
p10469
aS'[15:39] <phoenix_firebrd> so which one should i join now?\n'
p10470
aS'[15:39] <shadeslayer> both\n'
p10471
aS'[15:39] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I have successfully built the tomboy-blogposter, can you check my build log?\n'
p10472
aS'[15:39] <yofel> then release-team will be enough for now\n'
p10473
aS'[15:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p10474
aS'[15:40] <yofel> bug Riddell about packagers sometime\n'
p10475
aS"[15:40] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: as I said, I don't know enough about mono packages to QA that\n"
p10476
aS'[15:40] <shadeslayer> #ubuntu-motu\n'
p10477
aS'[15:41] <shadeslayer> that channel probably has mono ninjas lurking in every corner\n'
p10478
