aS'[14:11] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am inside the .pbuilder-hooks dir and i can see some files there\n'
p261
aS"[14:12] <smartboyhw> phoenix_firebrd, you're better than me, I don't even have that dir\n"
p262
aS'[14:12] <phoenix_firebrd> smartboyhw: yofel helped me\n'
p263
aS'[14:13] <BluesKaj> is this some kind of competition ? \n'
p264
aS'[14:13] <phoenix_firebrd> smartboyhw: truely i forgot how i got that folder\n'
p265
aS'[14:13] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, no. \n'
p266
aS'[14:14] <phoenix_firebrd> smartboyhw: i saw that you have built a package for the upcoming release, congrats\n'
p267
aS'[14:14] <yofel> ok, now I have a minute...\n'
p268
aS'[14:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: help\n'
p269
aS'[14:14] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: why would you use that ppa in pbuilder?\n'
p270
aS'[14:14] <shadeslayer> yofel: ktp-desktop-applets needs git ktp-common-internals\n'
p271
aS'[14:14] <smartboyhw> phoenix_firebrd, thanks:D\n'
p272
aS'[14:15] <shadeslayer> which is only available from that ppa\n'
p273
aS'[14:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: need a updated version of ktp-common-internals\n'
p274
aS'[14:15] <yofel> shadeslayer, phoenix_firebrd: in *that* case, I just login with --save-after-login and edit the sources.list inside\n'
p275
aS'[14:15] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p276
aS'[14:15] <shadeslayer> yofel: I find it easier to just do everything after it fails and then copy over the debian folder\n'
p277
aS"[14:16] <yofel> well, works too, I don't like fiddling with the build too much\n"
p278
aS'[14:16] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so you want me to add the daily build repo to the pbuilder with the save after login option?\n'
p279
aS'[14:16]  * shadeslayer is still waiting for debsign\n'
p280
aS'[14:17] <yofel> smartboyhw: for the hooks: "bzr co lp:~kubuntu-packagers/pbuilder/pbuilder-hooks ~/.pbuilder-hooks"\n'
p281
aS'[14:17] <yofel> smartboyhw: and add HOOKDIR="$HOME/.pbuilder-hooks" to your .pbuilderrc\n'
p282
aS'[14:17] <yofel> they make life a bit easier\n'
p283
aS"[14:17] <yofel> disable the apt hooks if you're low on bandwidth\n"
p284
aS'[14:18] <yofel> (with chmod -x)\n'
p285
aS"[14:18] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: well, that's how I do it\n"
p286
aS'[14:18] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: do i have to create a base image for a new project?\n'
p287
aS'=== ben__ is now known as vassie\n'
p288
aS'[14:19] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: you could probably add a hook script that installs software-properties-common and runs add-apt-repository too\n'
p289
aS'[14:19] <yofel> but I just manage that by hand\n'
p290
aS'[14:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i will go by your way\n'
p291
aS"[14:20] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: well, if you want to keep them apart yes, in which case you'll have to change the naming of the image\n"
p292
aS'[14:20] <yofel> not sure how to do that with pbuilder-dist\n'
p293
aS'[14:24] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: my pbuilderrc again: http://paste.kde.org/662588/ - the BASETGZ handling is the relevant part. My build command later looks like "sudo -E dist=r pro=ninja pbuilder build ..."\n'
p294
aS"[14:25] <yofel> smartboyhw: ^ that rc is a bit overkill complex, but maybe you'll find something useful\n"
p295
aS'=== Quintasan_ is now known as Quintasan\n'
p296
aS"[14:25] <Quintasan> Darkwing: I'm going to try send your tshirt, sorry it takes so long\n"
p297
aS'[14:25]  * Quintasan is dumb and forgetful\n'
p298
aS'[14:25] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh ok\n'
p299
aS'[14:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what is this  pro=ninja?\n'
p300
aS"[14:27] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: I guess it's shot for profile\n"
p301
aS'[14:27] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: ok\n'
p302
aS'[14:27]  * rgreening pokes Quintasan\n'
p303
aS'[14:27] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: Note people round here usually have two pbuilders for each release\n'
p304
aS'[14:27] <Quintasan> rgreening: Hi\n'
p305
aS'[14:27] <rgreening> sup dude\n'
p306
aS'[14:27] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: oh\n'
p307
aS'[14:28] <shadeslayer> yeah, the second one is called a PPA xD\n'
p308
aS'[14:28] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: so when we are creating we can give a profile name? \n'
p309
aS'[14:28] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: We usually have one clean pbuilder and one with ninjas ppa enabled so you can testbuild latest kde there without going through the hassle of logging in pbuilder, making changes, building and reverting them again.\n'
p310
aS"[14:29] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: you can though it's usually not needed\n"
p311
aS'[14:29] <Quintasan> since with this pbuilderrc you can invoke stuff like\n'
p312
aS'[14:29] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: how can i add a ppa to my current pbuilder\n'
p313
aS'[14:29] <Quintasan> sudo -E DIST=raring ARCH=i386 pbuilder create and you will get a basetgz file called raring-i386.tgz\n'
p314
aS'[14:29] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: http://paste.kde.org/662588/ line 68 handles that, if I say "dist=r pro=ninja" it would look for a raring-ninja-amd64-base.tgz and use that\n'
p315
aS"[14:30] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok i will try that'\n"
p316
aS'[14:30] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: log into the pbuilder, add the ppa to sources.list and save the changes\n'
p317
aS'[14:30] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: one would do it via pbuilder login --save-after-login\n'
p318
aS'[14:30] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: that is what /var/cache/pbuilder/ looks like here ^^ http://paste.kde.org/662612\n'
p319
aS"[14:31] <Quintasan> rgreening: Nothing much, started uni and now I have some free time to I'm trying to sort out overdue things on my todo\n"
p320
aS'[14:31] <Quintasan> like sending Darkwing his tshirt\n'
p321
aS"[14:31] <rgreening> Quintasan: cool. I've been afk for quite a while. work took over my life there for a while\n"
p322
aS'[14:32] <rgreening> looking to get back to packaging :)\n'
p323
aS'[14:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can i clone my current profile?\n'
p324
aS"[14:32] <Quintasan> hah, lot's of things to do this cycle\n"
p325
aS"[14:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: pbuilder's\n"
p326
aS'[14:32] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: you can just copy the tgz file I believe\n'
p327
aS'[14:32] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: define clone, if you mean make a copy of the base image sure, just use cp\n'
p328
aS'[14:33] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: yofel ok\n'
p329
aS'[14:33] <yofel> probably faster than making a competely new one\n'
p330
aS"[14:33] <yofel> actually that'll be definitely much faster\n"
p331
aS'[14:33] <Quintasan> yofel: You did tell him what those tgzs actually are?\n'
p332
aS'[14:33] <shadeslayer> 4.10 going up for precise\n'
p333
aS'[14:33] <yofel> Quintasan: not really, one of the bazillion things I forgot\n'
p334
aS'[14:33] <shadeslayer> all done\n'
p335
aS'[14:34]  * shadeslayer braces for 142 emails\n'
p336
aS'[14:34] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: See, those tgz files are actually base systems tar gzipped (think the whole directory structure under /)\n'
p337
aS'[14:34] <jussi> shadeslayer: I can sign you up to a few spam lists if you want :P :P \n'
p338
aS'[14:35] <shadeslayer> erm, no thx\n'
p339
aS'[14:35] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yeah:D\n'
p340
aS"[14:35] <shadeslayer> I'm subscribed to way too many email lists\n"
p341
aS"[14:35] <Quintasan> jussi: I kind of think you would kill shadeslayer's connection\n"
p342
aS'[14:35] <jussi> haha\n'
p343
aS'[14:35] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: hah, nope, I have a 2 Mbps line now\n'
p344
aS"[14:35] <yofel> Quintasan: it's not that bad these days\n"
p345
aS'[14:35] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: pbuilder just unpacks those, chroots into them, copies the files to build there and starts the whole building procedure then\n'
p346
aS'[14:35] <shadeslayer> so a sane amount of bandwidth\n'
p347
aS'[14:35] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: thats right\n'
p348
aS'[14:36] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: but there should be a proper way to do these things right?\n'
p349
aS'[14:36] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: to do what?\n'
p350
aS'[14:36] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: using a ppa inside pbuilder\n'
p351
aS'[14:36] <Quintasan> yeah\n'
p352
aS'[14:37] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: like pbuilder clone base base-ninja\n'
p353
aS'[14:37] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: usually you want to have at least one clean (ie. NO changes) pbuilder for each release\n'
p354
aS'[14:37] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: there an OTHERMIRROR setting for that\n'
p355
aS'[14:37] <yofel> oh, for that\n'
p356
aS'[14:37] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: Not really, just copy the tgz\n'
p357
aS"[14:37] <Quintasan> rename it appropriately and you're done\n"
p358
aS'[14:37] <yofel> not really, you just run pbuilder create a few times. Copying the tar is faster\n'
p359
aS'[14:37] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: done copying and renaming\n'
p360
aS'[14:38] <Quintasan> say I have precise.tgz and I want to have another pbuilder for ninja stuff so I copy it over to precise-ninja.tgz\n'
p361
aS'[14:38] <Quintasan> phoenix_firebrd: By ninja we mean the stuff involved with packaging newest KDE releases\n'
p362
aS'[14:38] <phoenix_firebrd> Quintasan: ok\n'
p363
aS'[14:41] <smartboyhw> Anyone will be online on 20th Feb, 12:00 UTC?\n'
p364
aS'[14:43] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: Presumably I will.\n'
p365
aS'[14:43] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: LOOONG way to 20th :P\n'
p366
aS'[14:43] <smartboyhw> lol\n'
p367
aS'[14:43] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: how go the exams\n'
p368
aS'[14:44] <Quintasan> I bombed logic but I have second try at it\n'
p369
aS'[14:44] <smartboyhw> applying for Ubuntu membership at that time...\n'
p370
aS'[14:44] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: Physics exam is on 4th but I get C for just coming there xD\n'
p371
aS'[14:44] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p372
aS'[14:46] <Quintasan> maliit is done faster thanks to Laney\n'
p373
aS'[14:46] <Quintasan> He will sync it when it gets accepted in Debian and we need testers\n'
p374
aS'[14:47] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: not that I worked with you but if you send any examples of your work my way I can say a good word or two there :P\n'
p375
aS'[14:47] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, eh? I got 8 testimonials at my wiki already\n'
p376
aS'[14:47] <smartboyhw> And it is very difficult to SHOW my work\n'
p377
aS"[14:47] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: You're good to go then :P\n"
p378
aS'[14:47] <smartboyhw> I mainly do Quality Assurance:P\n'

p386
aS'[14:48] <Quintasan> QA GET!\n'
p387

p388
aS'[14:49] <smartboyhw> kajongg 4.10.0 failed in precise\n'
p389
aS'[14:49] <Quintasan> implying I know how to use and implying I have time to learn it\n'
p390
aS'[14:50] <smartboyhw> Dependency problems:P\n'
p391
aS'[14:57] <yofel> smartboyhw: the stuff on http://yofel.dyndns.org/kubuntu/build_status_4.10.0_precise.html will mostly auto-resolve itself when the packages get auto-retried\n'

aS'[14:57] <smartboyhw> yofel, yeah I know:D\n'

aS'[15:58] <shadeslayer> SNA seems slightly jerky\n'

aS'[15:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the current version in the beta ppa of libktpcommoninternalsprivate-dev is 0.5.2, but it builds with v0.5.2+ in the ninjas ppa, so should i have to put the version requirent as >0.5.2  ?\n'

aS'[15:59] <dragotin> hi, I am the upstream maintainer of https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+source/kraft\n'

p532
aS'[16:00] <dragotin> its rather new in launchpad\n'
p533
aS'[16:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: 0.5.2 < 0.5.2+git20130201+r281-7~raring1   ?\n'
p534
aS'[16:02] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: right\n'
p535
aS'[16:02] <yofel> dragotin: you mean the raring package (0.50) for the other 2 releases?\n'
p536
aS'[16:02] <dragotin> yofel: yes\n'
p537
aS'[16:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so "libktpcommoninternalsprivate-dev (> 0.5.2)" right?\n'
p538
aS'[16:03] <dragotin> yofel: people ask me where they can install kraft from\n'
p539
aS'[16:03] <dragotin> yofel: and I wonder if there is another way than doing a ppa\n'
p540
aS"[16:03] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: >>, > is deprecated (I just need to remember where that's documented)\n"

aS'[16:05] <yofel> I need to go, someone else can probably help you with filing a backport request\n'
p543
aS'[16:05]  * yofel makes his way home\n'
p544
aS'[16:09] <shadeslayer> dragotin: would you be willing to QA the packages?\n'
p545
aS'[16:09] <dragotin> shadeslayer: sure\n'
p546
aS'[16:09] <shadeslayer> for both 12.04 and 12.10\n'
p547
aS'[16:09] <shadeslayer> alright, give me a couple of minutes\n'
p548
aS'[16:11] <dragotin> shadeslayer: ah, you pushed it to raring as well, right?\n'
p549
aS'[16:11] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p550
aS'[16:11] <phoenix_firebrd> whose name i should put in debian/copyright, Files: debian/* . The standard version that i am using is 3.9.3 \n'
p551

p552

p553
aS'[16:12] <dragotin> shadeslayer: thanks btw :-)\n'
p554
aS'[16:12] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: according to 3.9.3 this is not required right?\n'
p555
aS'[16:12] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: not required?\n'
p556
aS'[16:12] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i mean the standars\n'
p557
aS"[16:12] <shadeslayer> dragotin: np, as long as someone QA's the package I can backport it\n"
p558
aS'[16:14] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: clause 12.5 of 3.9.3 says that "debian/copyright is no longer required to list the Debian maintainers involved in the creation of the package (although note that the requirement to list copyright information is unchanged)."\n'
p559
aS'[16:14] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: is there a bot to check this from here?\n'
p560
aS'[16:16] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: sounds fine \n'
p561
aS'[16:17] <shadeslayer> you can skip the copyright for debian/*\n'

aS'[16:23] <shadeslayer> steam, y u no send verification code :(\n'

aS'[16:24] <shadeslayer> oh \n'
p571
aS'[16:25] <shadeslayer> nvm\n'
p572
aS'[16:25] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p573
aS'[16:26] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the src folder contains files with gpl2+ and lgpl with 2 diff authors how can i put that in the copyright file?\n'
p574
aS'[16:26] <shadeslayer> read up on the dep5 format\n'
p575
aS'[16:26] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: should i have to mention by each file?\n'

p579
aS"[16:42] <ricktimmis> Struggling with apt-get sources, Riddell: set me a task to write a script to grab a packages dependancy list, and then get all the sources and do a uscan. The problem is that apt-get source is returning some sources, but also GIt, Svn, Bzr repos for a bunch of others. Also uscan doesn't seem to produce anything if a package file doesn't have a Watch file. I think I might be drowning on this one\n"
p580
aS'[16:43] <shadeslayer> ricktimmis: break it down into small steps\n'
p581
aS"[16:43] <shadeslayer> that's what I've personally discovered when automating things with bash\n"
p582
aS'[16:44] <shadeslayer> yofel: btw any ideas what STEAM_RUNTIME is?\n'
p583
aS'[16:56] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: awake?\n'
p584
aS'[16:56] <shadeslayer> barely\n'
p585
aS"[16:57] <shadeslayer> I'll go to sleep as soon as debsign is done\n"
p586
aS'[16:57] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the copyright file for ktp-desktop-applets http://paste.kde.org/663116/ the source field has to be updated yet\n'
p587
aS'[16:58] <shadeslayer> line 5?\n'
p588
aS'[16:58] <shadeslayer> and you can combine 2 authors\n'
p589
aS'[16:59] <shadeslayer> so you can do: Files: contact/*\n'
p590
aS'[16:59] <shadeslayer> Copyright: Year1 Author1 <Email1>\n'
p591
aS'[16:59] <shadeslayer>          Year2 Author2 <Email2>\n'
p592
aS'[17:00] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: line 5 is exactly present in the ktp-presence-applet and i will make the contact licenses field merges\n'
p593
aS'[17:02] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: when i am merging like what you said what should i put in the license field\n'
p594
aS'[17:02] <shadeslayer> actually\n'
p595
aS'[17:02] <shadeslayer> merge by license\n'
p596
aS'[17:02] <shadeslayer> so all of the GPL-2+ code licensing should go together\n'
p597
aS'[17:03] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so the files field comma seperated?\n'
p598
aS'[17:03] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: list?\n'
p599
aS'[17:03] <shadeslayer> list\n'
p600
aS'[17:03] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\n'
p601
aS'[17:03] <shadeslayer> so Files : foo/*\n'
p602
aS'[17:03] <shadeslayer> bar/*\n'
p603
aS'=== jono is now known as Guest41351\n'
p604
aS'[17:07] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: http://paste.kde.org/663134/\n'
p605
aS'[17:07] <shadeslayer> close, not there yet\n'
p606
aS'[17:08] <shadeslayer> the 2  contact/* will represent the same set of files\n'
p607
aS'[17:08] <shadeslayer> so you need to explicitly list the files\n'
p608
aS'[17:08] <shadeslayer> so you could do : contact/foo.*\n'
p609
aS'[17:08] <shadeslayer> and contact/bar.*\n'
p610
aS'[17:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\n'
p611
aS'[17:11] <apachelogger> eh\n'
p612
aS'[17:11] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: ?\n'
p613
aS'[17:11] <apachelogger> Riddell: can we put AG Alex on moderation until he learns to selectively quote\n'
p614
aS"[17:11] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: he's probably at FOSDEM\n"
p615
aS'[17:11] <apachelogger> ah, getting wasted\n'
p616
aS'[17:12] <apachelogger> stupid fosdem\n'
p617
aS'[17:12] <shadeslayer> but I agree\n'
p618
aS'[17:12] <shadeslayer> okay, kde sc 4.10 for precise take 2\n'
p619
aS'[17:13] <apachelogger> oh, he also sent the same reply three times\n'
p620
aS'[17:13] <apachelogger> Oo\n'
p621
aS'[17:13] <apachelogger> yeah, so that makes me even more unwilling to read the bikeshed\n'
p622
aS'[17:13] <shadeslayer> heh yeah\n'
p623
aS"[17:14] <apachelogger> > because I'm not a developer and I can't help with it\n"
p624
aS"[17:14] <apachelogger> that's fun though\n"

aS'[17:14] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: people converted the thread into a bikeshed :|\n'

p627
aS'[17:14] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p628
aS'[17:14] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: nono, it was wa bikeshed to begin with\n'
p629
aS"[17:15] <apachelogger> in fact all thraeds except for Riddell's tablet request is a bikeshed right now\n"
p630
aS'[17:15] <shadeslayer> 0.o\n'
p631
aS"[17:15] <shadeslayer> define 'all'\n"
p632

p633
aS'[17:16] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: http://paste.kde.org/663152/\n'
p634
aS"[17:16] <shadeslayer> the difference being I'll actually implement them\n"
p635
aS'[17:17] <shadeslayer> or atleast try to\n'
p636
aS'[17:17] <shadeslayer> what\n'
p637
aS'[17:17] <phoenix_firebrd> thats the dir contents\n'
p638
aS'[17:17] <shadeslayer> and?\n'
p639
aS'[17:17] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: do you want me to list individual files?\n'
p640
aS'[17:18] <shadeslayer> lol, oxygen icons uploading at 100 Mbps\n'
p641
aS'[17:18] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: throught your isp?\n'
p642
aS'[17:18] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: kind of, you can conver both contact-wrapper.h and contact-wrapper.cpp with contact-wrapper.*\n'
p643
aS'[17:18] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: heh no\n'
p644
aS'[17:19] <shadeslayer> rinse and repeat for files belonging to a certain license\n'
p645
aS'[17:19] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: that i can do, even then i have to list the 4 files\n'
p646
aS'[17:19] <shadeslayer> which 4 files?\n'
p647
aS'[17:19] <shadeslayer> the qml ones?\n'
p648
aS'[17:20] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i mean 5 , the 5 cpps\n'
p649
aS'[17:20] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  1.*, 2.* ... 5.*\n'
p650
aS'[17:20] <shadeslayer> erm, like I said, you can reduce it to half\n'
p651
aS'[17:20] <shadeslayer> but yes\n'
p652
aS'[17:20] <shadeslayer> you will have to do that\n'
p653
aS'[17:20] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\n'
p654
aS"[17:21] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: I wouldn't know what the current ideas are as the your thread went OT like 3 times or something\n"
p655
aS'[17:21] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p656
aS"[17:21] <shadeslayer> I didn't bother replying to the OT ideas\n"
p657
aS'[17:21] <apachelogger> so if the latest idea is to put the installer in the favorites you can just as well make firefox the default\n'
p658
aS'[17:21] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p659
aS'[17:22] <apachelogger> because that is basically saying "if you don\'t like our excellent kde sofwtare, here\'s another thing"\n'
p660
aS"[17:22] <shadeslayer> the excellent kde software you talk about isn't so excellent when browsing sites\n"
p661
aS'[17:22] <apachelogger> in particular the reason we did not put it there to begin with and why we did not make it a generic browser installer is because we simply wanted people who already know firefox as a brand toget easy access to it\n'
p662
aS'[17:23] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: yeah, so change to firefox :P\n'
p663
aS'[17:23] <shadeslayer> not enough visibility\n'
p664
aS'[17:23] <shadeslayer> atleast imho\n'
p665
aS"[17:24] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: would you expect people to search for more stuff, or just go to firefox.org since that's what they're accustomed to\n"
p666
aS'[17:24] <shadeslayer> and when they land on ff.org ... surprise surprise, no binaries\n'
p667
aS'[17:24] <yofel> make the package manager more visible, you can find everyone there\n'
p668
aS'[17:25] <yofel> back when it was put under "computer" I wanted to file a bug because I didn\'t see it\n'
p669
aS"[17:25] <yofel> now *I* know it's there\n"
p670
aS'[17:25] <yofel> s/everyone/everything/\n'

p672
aS'[17:25] <yofel> too much coffee\n'
p673
aS'[17:25] <shadeslayer> It took me 3 months to find Quassel\n'
p674
aS'[17:25] <shadeslayer> and then another 3 months after that I was told about krunner\n'
p675
aS'[17:26] <apachelogger> regular folks look at the menu\n'
p676
aS'[17:26] <apachelogger> ...searching for games :P\n'
p677
aS'[17:28] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: if the ML is any indication to go by, regular people now scare the hell out of me\n'
p678
aS'[17:29] <yofel> regular users always demand something, get used to it\n'
p679
aS'[17:29] <apachelogger> regular people do not join mailing lists\n'
p680
aS'[17:29] <yofel> good point\n'
p681
aS'[17:29] <shadeslayer> thank god\n'
p682
aS'[17:29]  * shadeslayer finds the bit about having 2 panels hilarious\n'
p683
aS'[17:29] <apachelogger> what yofel called regular users there is the omgworldwillendcomputerisnotworkingright community\n'
p684
aS'[17:29] <apachelogger> the rest of the world knows that computers are shit and deal with it :P\n'
p685
aS'[17:30] <shadeslayer> lol\n'
p686
aS'[17:35] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: Change in AptUrl-Kde to not depend on software-properties-kde\n'
p687

p688
aS'=== ximion is now known as ximion-afk\n'
p689
aS'[17:35] <yofel> as long as it still works after that +1 for that change\n'
p690
aS'[17:35] <apachelogger> although IIRC we decided to kill apturl or osmethign\n'
p691
aS'[17:35] <shadeslayer> yeah\n'
p692
aS"[17:36] <apachelogger> where's JT\n"
p693
aS'[17:36] <apachelogger> he will know\n'
p694

p695
aS'[17:36] <apachelogger> well\n'
p696
aS'[17:36] <apachelogger> ubuntu uses it or something :P\n'
p697
aS'[17:36] <apachelogger> plus a lot of support sites do\n'

p803
aS"[14:44] <shadeslayer> or rather, I don't understand the context\n"

p806

p812
aS"[14:50] <yofel> shadeslayer: it's the same as how here kubuntu-ninjas access isn't 100% packagers only\n"
p813
aS'[14:50] <yofel> we have a few testers there too\n'
p814

p815
aS"[14:51] <shadeslayer> I'm still slightly confused\n"
p816
aS"[14:51] <yofel> I'm not too sure how chakra intends to handle that\n"
p817
aS"[14:52] <rdieter> shadeslayer: hi, yeah, my vague recollection is that there's a balance to be found between making the tarballs public versus testing things.\n"
p818
aS'[14:52] <yofel> maybe in a way that would be "put it into raring-proposed and keep it there till released" for us\n'
p819
aS'[14:52] <yofel> which I would actually like to do too if we could reliably pin them there\n'
p820
aS'[14:53] <shadeslayer> so basically, upload them publically, but make them real hard to access?\n'
p821
aS'[14:53] <yofel> pretty much\n'
p822
aS'[14:53] <rdieter> iirc, some distro or 2 released builds as public updates prior to kde release once or twice, which was frowned-upon.  I think the accepted compromised was to ensure that these are for *testing only*.\n'
p823
aS'[14:54] <rdieter> which I hope was what I conveyed in my reply today\n'
p824
aS'[14:54]  * shadeslayer shrugs\n'
p825
aS'[14:55] <rdieter> the point is:  avoid cases like "Distro X releases KDE Y.Z" type press release prior to kde.org mentioning the release at all.\n'
p826
aS'[14:59] <shadeslayer> how many times has that happened?\n'

p1238

p1239
aS'[13:30] <apachelogger> y u no do it?\n'
p1240
aS'[13:30] <shadeslayer> because I want him to review stuff\n'
p1241
aS'[13:30] <apachelogger> months will pass until trever finds time to do it\n'
p1242
aS'[13:30] <shadeslayer> true ... it did take him 2 weeks just to make a chroot with gst1.0\n'
p1243
aS"[13:31] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: btw if we ship pgst 4.7 for Kubuntu, we'll have to rebuild everything against 1.0\n"

p1248
aS"[13:32] <shadeslayer> though that's not shipped on the CD so meh\n"
p1249
aS'[13:32] <apachelogger> why do you want to have gst1 in the feature scope for 4.7?\n'
p1250
aS'[13:32] <shadeslayer> because it sounds like a good target?\n'
p1251
aS'[13:32] <apachelogger> what I would do is ... branch 4.7 and relase that, then merge gst1 into master to become 4.8\n'
p1252
aS'[13:32] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'
p1253
aS'[13:33] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: it also soudns like a good way to delay a possible release for no good reason :P\n'
p1254
aS'[13:33] <shadeslayer> hehe\n'
p1255
aS'[13:33] <shadeslayer> okay, how about I have a look at branching 4.7 this weekend\n'
p1256
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: it seems there is only one feature in 4.7 though ^^\n'
p1257
aS'[13:35] <shadeslayer> lol\n'
p1258
aS'[13:35] <shadeslayer> snapshot?\n'
p1259
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> plus a whole lot of random minor improvements\n'
p1260
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: oh, snapshot too... so there are 2 features :D\n'
p1261
aS'[13:35] <shadeslayer> :D\n'
p1262
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> channel selection + snapshot\n'
p1263
aS'[13:35] <shadeslayer> huzzah\n'
p1264
aS'[13:35] <apachelogger> well\n'
p1265
aS'[13:36] <apachelogger> we had no API additions in a while so I suppose there is a point where almost no features can get in\n'
p1266
aS'[13:36] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p1267
aS'[13:36] <apachelogger> that being said the biggest feature that is in master is qml/graphicsobject support which would probably have to be stripped from a possible release as there is no phonon4.7\n'
p1268
aS'[13:36] <shadeslayer> in pgst?\n'
p1269
aS'[13:36] <apachelogger> yes\n'
p1270
aS'[13:37] <apachelogger> oh and that was I believe only quickly hacked together in randa\n'
p1271
aS'[13:37] <apachelogger> so not very releasable I guess\n'
p1272
aS'[13:37] <shadeslayer> heh\n'
p1273
aS'[13:37] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'
p1274
aS'[13:37] <shadeslayer> so, branch 4.7, revert QML bits\n'
p1275
aS'[13:37] <shadeslayer> release?\n'
p1276
aS'[13:38] <shadeslayer> maybe also fix that bangarang issue?\n'

aS'[13:39] <Peace--> btw ... can someone fix the  plasmaengineexplorer \n'

p1288
aS"[13:39] <apachelogger> if no one wants them in a relase of p4 I'd deactivate them in all repos, release a last minor version and then consider master frozen for features\n"
p1289
aS'[13:39] <apachelogger> (i.e. further 4.7 releases happen from master and p5 development in a branch)\n'
p1290

p1345
aS'[17:22] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: is this a common practice?\n'
p1346
aS'[17:23] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: yes, keeping the full source code in bzr gets very faffy very quickly\n'
p1347
aS'[17:23] <Riddell> best to keep them separate\n'

aS"[17:23] <Riddell> it's the main reason why UDD isn't very popular I think\n"

aS'[17:46] <shadeslayer> "qa.debian.org runs a redirector which allows a simpler form of URL for SourceForge based projects."\n'

aS'[17:50] <shadeslayer> for eg. if you release foo-0.1.tar.gz and then release bar_1.tar.xz and your watch file only takes one of the conditions \n'

p1701
aS"[14:26] <yofel> you don't - fix is not to use UDD, that package isn't meant to be used with UDD\n"
p1702
aS"[14:26] <yofel> but if a new language was added/removed you'll have to adjust the control file. The package entries all look the same anyway\n"
p1703
aS'[14:28] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: shadeslayer now says that "Files: *" means all files(recursively) for a particular license type ex. GPL-3+, but where is the documentation for that? all  i know is that ls* list all the files in the dir , but not recursively .\n'
p1704
aS'[14:33] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: hmm looks ok to me\n'
p1705
aS'[14:35] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: does "Files:  *" means all files recursively or just all files in the path?\n'
p1706
aS'[14:35] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: all file recursively is my understanding\n'
p1707
aS"[14:36] <shadeslayer> okay, I think I'm not clearly explaining the Files field\n"
p1708
aS'[14:36] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: why is it now specified in the manual?\n'
p1709
aS'[14:36] <shadeslayer> as I understood it : Files: * -> major license of src\n'
p1710
aS'[14:36] <phoenix_firebrd> oh\n'
p1711
aS'[14:37] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: oh I see lines 7, 8, 9 are incorrect then\n'
p1712
aS'[14:37] <shadeslayer> then Files: foo/* or foo.* -> license exceptions\n'
p1713
aS"[14:37] <shadeslayer> that's what I was trying to explain\n"
p1714
aS'[14:37] <Riddell> shadeslayer: yes I agree\n'
p1715
aS'[14:38] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: so you have listed LGPL as being * all files and GPL as being an exception for some\n'
p1716
aS"[14:38] <Riddell> it's mixed licencing so you could argue either way\n"
p1717
aS"[14:38] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i didn't know that , it was not specified in the documents\n"
p1718
aS"[14:38] <Riddell> but GPL takes precidence and that's what they have in their COPYING file\n"
p1719
aS"[14:38] <Riddell> so I'd have the first block as Files: * for GPL then a block of Files: which names the files under LGPL\n"
p1720
aS'[14:39] <Riddell> also tell upstream to put a COPYING.LIB file with the LGPL full text in it\n'

p1723
aS'=== jackyalcine is now known as Jacky_\n'
p1724
aS'[14:40] <phoenix_firebrd> this is a set theory, all the files are lgpl but somefiles are gpl, right?\n'
p1725
aS'[14:41] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I know nothing about the old sponsorship procedure (non-UDD) so can you teach me the procedures?\n'
p1726
aS'[14:41] <phoenix_firebrd> this is a set theory, all the files are lgpl except somefiles are gpl, right?\n'
p1727
aS'[14:42] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ^\n'
p1728
aS'[14:42] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you run  debuild -S  and get source package files .dsc .debian.tar.gz and .orig.tar.gz and you pass those to the sponsor who checks and uploads them\n'
p1729
aS'[14:42] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: no, usually licensing is consistent\n'
p1730
aS'[14:42] <smartboyhw> Riddell, how do I "pass"?\n'
p1731
aS"[14:43] <shadeslayer> for eg. I don't think the KDE SC has mixed licensing in each of its components, though I could be wrong\n"
p1732
aS"[14:43] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: you can go either way but it's probably better to say all are GPL with some are LGPL\n"
p1733
aS'[14:44] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  so if i remove contact/src/contact-delegate.* ,  contact/src/abstract-contact-delegate.* it implies that they are lgpl unless i define its not . right?\n'
p1734
aS'[14:44] <Riddell> smartboyhw: put them on a web server? upload to a PPA? e-mail attachments?  IRC DCC messaging? telepathy tubes?\n'

aS'[14:45] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: yes\n'
p1739

p1740
aS"[14:47] <shadeslayer> isn't that field deprecated\n"
p1741
aS'[14:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: is it not necessary to list file specific copyright owner?\n'
p1742
aS'[14:47] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: check the example of http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/\n'
p1743
aS'[14:47] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: no, unless that file has a different license than the rest of the sources\n'
p1744
aS"[14:47] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: it's not, it's optional\n"
p1745
aS'[14:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so that field has to be removed?\n'
p1746
aS'[14:48] <Riddell> "The Copyright and License fields in the header paragraph may complement but do not replace the Files paragraphs."\n'
p1747

aS'[18:07] <Riddell> IRC colours? sounds evil?\n'
p1882
aS'[18:07] <shadeslayer> really? :P\n'
p1883
aS'[18:07] <shadeslayer> Its the one thing I really wanted from quassel\n'

p1887
aS'[18:08] <shadeslayer> hey ho\n'
p1888
aS"[18:08] <Riddell> everyone hates those colours, it's only used by spammers to draw silly picures\n"
p1889
aS"[18:08] <genii-around> It's actually good. Except sometimes when two different people with same-length nick randomly get same colour and confuses\n"
p1890
aS'[18:09] <Riddell_> one two one two\n'
p1891
aS'[18:10] <Riddell_> no difference\n'
p1892
aS"[18:10] <shadeslayer> that's because your own color is black\n"

p1899
aS"[18:11] <Riddell_> ooh you're all red\n"
p1900
aS'[18:11] <shadeslayer> yeah, so, IMHO this should be enabled by default :)\n'
p1901
aS"[18:11] <Riddell_> is there a good reason why upstream haven't done so?\n"
p1902
aS'[18:11] <Riddell_> Sput?\n'
p1903
aS"[18:12] <shadeslayer> no idea, but I've poked him as to why this isn't default\n"
p1904
aS'[18:14] <Riddell> Darkwing, ScottK, apachelogger, JontheEchidna, jussi: shadeslayer wants to know if you think buying a VM for kubuntu use would be a good idea\n'
p1905
aS'[18:15] <Riddell> shadeslayer: well no objection from me on quassel\n'
p1906
aS'[18:15] <shadeslayer> a very underpowered VM that we can use for hosting status pages and doing initial uploads etc\n'
p1907
aS'[18:16] <jussi> No. we should approach kubuntu "friends" about having something donated. I need to check with tsimpson, but we may even have space on ubottu.com\'s VM.\n'
p1908
aS'[18:16] <shadeslayer> oh, awesomer\n'
p1909
aS'[18:16] <shadeslayer> Riddell: any news on that new feature tour?\n'
p1910
aS"[18:17] <Riddell> um, I don't know, was someone even doing it?\n"
p1911
aS'[18:17] <jussi> Thanks to rackspace we have that lovely VM\n'
p1912
aS'[18:17] <shadeslayer> idk either\n'
p1913
aS"[18:17] <shadeslayer> but I'd like to have Muon added there\n"
p1914
aS'[18:17] <jussi> (hear that, if you need to buy a VM, rackspace... ;) )\n'
p1915
aS"[18:17] <Riddell> I know lots of people have suggested it but I don't know if anyone has started on it\n"
p1916
aS'[18:17] <shadeslayer> jussi: but buyvm is ultra cheap :P\n'
p1917
aS'[18:17] <shadeslayer> 15 USD for a year\n'
p1918
aS"[18:17] <shadeslayer> you can't beat that\n"
p1919
aS'[18:18] <jussi> shadeslayer: lets see about the sharing of the ubottu vm\n'
p1920
aS'[18:18] <jussi> ;)\n'
p1921
aS'[18:18] <jussi> free ;)\n'
p1922
aS'[18:18] <Riddell> it is pretty close to pocket money\n'
p1923
aS'[18:18] <shadeslayer> yeah ;)\n'
p1924
aS'[18:19] <jussi> Riddell: mind, you could have mentioned that earlier... ie. when you asked\n'
p1925
aS"[18:21] <Riddell> I didn't ask, shadeslayer did!\n"
p1926
aS'[18:21] <shadeslayer> yep \n'
p1927
aS'[18:27] <shadeslayer> anywho, off to sleep since my ISO build is almost done\n'
p1928
aS'[18:27] <shadeslayer> nighters :)\n'
p1929
aS'=== Jacky_ is now known as zz_Jacky_\n'
p1930
aS"[19:28] <ScottK> Riddell: I don't recall use having really needed one where people didn't have stuff available.  Can status pages go on people.ubuntu.com?\n"
p1931
aS'[19:28] <ScottK> Also we could probably use ubuntuwire if needed.\n'
p1932
aS"[19:30] <Riddell> shadeslayer: not looking good for your vote, you'll never be a politician\n"
p1933
aS'[20:27] <Quintasan> Is it just me or we could save some trouble by throwing rekonq off and shipping firefox by default?\n'
p1934
aS'[21:02] <ScottK> Quintasan: Will it fit?\n'
p1935
aS'[21:03] <ScottK> If so, yes.\n'
p1936
aS'[21:07] <jussi> Quintasan: you would make lots of friend fast...\n'
p1937
aS'[21:08] <Quintasan> ScottK: So the main problem is not lack of KDE integration but space?\n'
p1938
aS'[21:09] <Quintasan> jussi: well, I feel like I read crapton of mails, each in different tone and the issue could be summed up as "put firefox by default, we don\'t really like rekonq"\n'
p1939
aS'[21:12] <jussi> Are the integration bits in the blue whatevr ppa not portable/do able for us? \n'
p1940
aS"[21:15] <ScottK> Quintasan: That's my opinion.\n"
p1941
aS'[21:15] <ScottK> Other people think the integration is essential.\n'
p1942
aS"[21:15] <ScottK> jussi: They aren't.\n"
p1943
aS'[21:15] <Quintasan> ScottK: Well that opinion of yours is essentialy the only factor limiting us I believe\n'
p1944
aS'[21:16] <ScottK> Which?\n'
p1945
aS"[21:16] <Quintasan> ScottK: I'd rather have security and stability than intergration\n"
p1946
aS'[21:16] <Quintasan> ScottK: lack of space\n'
p1947
aS"[21:16] <ScottK> Lack of space isn't an opinon.  Someone needs to figure out how much it would take and see if it's reasonable.\n"
p1948
aS"[21:17] <ScottK> If Blue Systems can work a deal to support the KDE patches in the Ubuntu Firefox packages, then I'm all for them.\n"
p1949
aS"[21:39] <Sput> Riddell: the main reason is that the sender colors are stored in a stylesheet, which needs to be in user's config dir, and which gets created the first time the user saves that setting in the config dialog\n"
p1950
aS'[21:39] <Sput> an alternative would be creating that stylesheet first time the user starts the client, of course\n'
p1951
aS"[21:40] <Sput> but for some reason I don't remember that was awkward to implement :)\n"
p1952
aS'[21:48] <Sput> , shadeslayer\n'
p1953
aS'[22:30] <bolo> i want to compile kde for the frist time and i need libiodbc (libiodbc2-dev) to compile soprano properly.  now apt-get tells me i need to remove all kde packages and so to install that which seems really strange.  am i missing something?  is this the right place to ask anyway?\n'
p1954
aS'[22:32] <yofel> bolo: we use unixodbc instead, give me a minute to look up what you need\n'
p1955
aS'[22:32] <yofel> bolo: you need libvirtodbc0, unixodbc-dev and this patch to build soprano: :q\n'

p1957
aS'[22:35] <bolo> yofel: thanks.  \n'
p1958
aS'[22:49] <bolo> it works. :)\n'
p1959
aS'[22:54] <Riddell> I wonder how we can make that obvious in the future\n'
p1960
aS'[22:56] <BarkingFish> evening guys :) Anyone know if Joseph Salisbury comes onto IRC at all please? \n'
p1961
aS"[22:57] <BarkingFish> He's helping me smash the ar5523 bug on the 3.8 kernel series right now - I just wanted to catch him and have a chat concerning the bug since I don't quite think I'm getting through.\n"
p1962
aS"[22:58] <BarkingFish> First time ar5523 appears as a module is 3.8.0-2 (working, anyhow) - he's got me testing 3.8.0-0 release candidates - the module wasn't even in existence in them :)\n"
p1963
aS"[22:59] <yofel> BarkingFish: he's jsalisbury in #ubuntu-kernel\n"
p1964
aS'[22:59] <bolo> Riddell: i think distro specific stuff is documentet at  http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/Distributions  \n'
p1965
aS'[22:59] <BarkingFish> aha :) Thanks yofel \n'
p1966
aS'[23:00] <bolo> at least thats where i looked\n'
p1967
aS'[23:16] <BarkingFish> hm.  Seems he might not be around atm :(  I thought I might get the chance to communicate with him "in person", so to speak\n'

S'[00:16] <AlexZion> hi everyone, I need some info about where to find few config file of KDE environment , usually starting from ~/.kde folder I guess ....\n'
p1979
aS'[00:18] <AlexZion> like for example , config about plasma and plasmoids .....\n'
p1980
aS'[00:21] <apachelogger> AlexZion: hey, #kde might be able to help you there\n'
p1981
aS'[00:30] <AlexZion> ok apachelogger I will ask there, but you may can halp me with another info...., to get a 13.04 distro daily full upgraded , should I add some extra repo once installed a 13.04  available here http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/ ? \n'
p1982
aS'[00:31] <apachelogger> no\n'
p1983
aS'[00:34] <AlexZion> thanks apachelogger, I\'ll try to play around "default settings" to propose a different one for the new release .... :)\n'
p1984
aS'[00:37] <apachelogger> nice\n'
p1985
aS'[00:45] <AlexZion> yeah apachelogger, I think it should be much more "New User" oriented ...., but maybe you already read some my idea on the mailing list ....  \n'
p1986
aS'[00:51] <AlexZion> apachelogger:  what about QML , do you think could be even possible build an applications to manage config file !?!\n'
p1987
aS'[00:51] <AlexZion> because I could even try myself with it ... :)\n'
p1988
aS'[00:52] <apachelogger> AlexZion: an application to manage config files?\n'
p1989
aS'[00:53] <AlexZion> something like !! , just for me and to learn  both .... for now .....\n'
p1990
aS'[00:54] <AlexZion> I guess QML is very nice even to prototype an apps .... \n'
p1991
aS'[00:55] <AlexZion> sayng maneging config file , I mean few key settings , and even manage it with some preset ....  \n'
p1992
aS"[00:55] <AlexZion> wouldn't be nice !?!\n"
p1993
aS"[00:57] <apachelogger> we have that, it's called systemsettings :P\n"
p1994
aS'[00:58] <AlexZion> really !?! :D \n'
p1995
aS"[00:59] <AlexZion> let's say...., taking few settings , something about 20/30 settings, and manage it with a some preset , could be very usefull in my opinion...\n"
p1996
aS"[01:01] <AlexZion> for example I'm pretty sure would be a problem to manage the size icon of any application , just because there isn't a centralized config for that , at least until  12.10\n"
p1997
aS'[01:02] <apachelogger> http://i.imgur.com/1cHSYZg.png\n'
p1998
aS"[01:05] <AlexZion> well , so it's perfect ....\n"
p1999
aS'[01:09] <AlexZion> apachelogger: do you think would be difficult to implement a "presets system" on systemsettings ? \n'
p2000
aS'[01:10] <AlexZion> of course not the entire systemsettings ....\n'
p2001
aS'[01:10] <apachelogger> well, we kind of have that already\n'
p2002
aS'[01:10] <apachelogger> i.e. kubuntu-settings-low-fat, kubuntu-settings-desktop etc.\n'
p2003
aS'[01:11] <apachelogger> they are essentially presets \n'
p2004
aS'[01:11] <apachelogger> so, no, it would generally not be hard, but it really depends on how you would want to do that\n'
p2005
aS'[01:11] <AlexZion> well, but they are more about tecnical settings ...., what about aspect or functionality , effects and so on ...\n'
p2006
aS"[01:12] <apachelogger> I am afraid I do not know what you mean by 'functionality' and 'effects'\n"
p2007
aS'[01:12] <AlexZion> and in any case , would be amazing having it with a simple switch button ....\n'
p2008
aS'[01:14] <AlexZion> ok , I mean windows behavior, plasma behavior, applications aspect, desktop effects, workspace aspect \n'
p2009
aS'[01:15] <apachelogger> that is exactly what those packages are about\n'
p2010
aS'[01:16] <AlexZion> I know , but what about a centralized preset system for that !?! , I mean a custom mode , and as presets as we need .....\n'
p2011
aS'[01:17] <AlexZion> why not?, I mean , it should be all about config management .....\n'
p2012
aS'[01:18] <AlexZion> of course working on great and solid base already there ....\n'
p2013
aS'[01:21] <sakang> wow 4.10 stable is out!\n'
p2014
aS'[01:22] <sakang> looks like they are 5 days old by looking at the timestamp.\n'
p2015
aS"[01:24] <apachelogger> who's old?\n"
p2016
aS'[01:25] <sakang> 4.10 sources\n'
p2017
aS'[01:25] <apachelogger> ah\n'
p2018
aS'[01:25] <apachelogger> why yes, tagging was 5 days ago ;)\n'
p2019
aS"[01:26] <sakang> meaning there wasn't any bug(s) since then?\n"
p2020
aS"[01:27] <apachelogger> meaning there weren't any release blocking bug reports since then\n"
p2021
aS'[01:27] <AlexZion> anyway system settings is the same for 32, 64 and mac version right ?\n'
p2022
aS'[01:27] <apachelogger> yes\n'
p2023
aS'[01:29] <AlexZion> yeaah , so I think it can be something relatively simple to do , and it would give a good benefit, even thinking about activities could use it ..... \n'
p2024
aS'[01:31] <apachelogger> activities have a preset system\n'
p2025
aS'[01:31] <AlexZion> even for those settings !?!\n'
p2026
aS'[01:33] <AlexZion> because if so , is already there what we are talking about ....\n'

aS'[11:35] <phoenix_firebrd> there should be an option to highlight icons\n'
p2190
aS'[11:36] <Riddell> actually the main problem I have with the systray is that notification popups have no visual connection to a systray icon\n'

p2243
aS'[12:04] <Riddell> Mirv: oh so just a sync?\n'
p2244
aS'[12:04] <Mirv> indeed what https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers/+archive/qt5-proper is\n'
p2245
aS'[12:04] <mikhas> Quintasan, depends on where Wayland is heading, right now.\n'
p2246
aS"[12:05] <Riddell> Mirv: no can sync, it's not in debian\n"
p2247
aS'[12:05] <mikhas> Personally, I am not interested in Android.\n'
p2248
aS'[12:05] <Mirv> Riddell: it\'s not uploaded into Debian yet. with all the release process going on, there wouldn\'t be much happening with NEW queue anyway. but I\'ve worked all of my "Ubuntu packagin" so far that it\'s all identical to Debian git aside from the version number and maintainer fields\n'
p2249
aS'[12:05] <mikhas> Quintasan, is there a e-mail message or such that confirms it has been accepted?\n'
p2250
aS"[12:05] <Riddell> Mirv: that's the way to do it :)\n"
p2251
aS'[12:06] <Mirv> but we need to have "-0ubuntu1" version numbers since they haven\'t been uploaded to Debian yet\n'
p2252
aS"[12:06] <Mirv> Riddell: yes it is.. we've tried to do this as directly in Debian as possible, especially since I've my Debian hat\n"

p2257
aS'[12:12] <mikhas> nice\n'
p2258
aS'[12:14] <mikhas> Quintasan, want to announce this on Maliit ML?\n'
p2259
aS'[12:15] <Quintasan> well\n'
p2260
aS"[12:15] <Riddell> Mirv: sounds like you're doing all good stuff, there's a question of where to keep the qt packaging in ubuntu in version control, we use ~kubuntu-packagers for qt4 which you'd be welcome to join or we could start a new team or try and not have anything ubuntu specific (but that never works alas)\n"
p2261
aS"[12:15] <Quintasan> mikhas: I think I can but I'm not really good at being all official and whatnot :D\n"
p2262
aS"[12:16] <Riddell> Quintasan: now's a good chance to learn :)\n"
p2263
aS'[12:16] <Mirv> Riddell: certainly I could join kubuntu-packagers, there are enouh teams already\n'

aS'[12:18] <Quintasan> ScottK: Any idea how can I get coresspodning dsc file from http://ftp-master.debian.org/new/maliit-framework_0.94.1-1.html ?\n'
p2266
aS'[12:19] <Mirv> when KDE starts to use Qt5, there will be probably some changes again compared to Debian at some point in time\n'
p2267
aS'[12:19] <ricktimmis> Riddell: Do you have a minute, I wanted to run a query by you in regard to the Uscan script ?\n'
p2268
aS'[12:19] <Mirv> and also if we need some Ubuntu specific patches that are not upstreamable (hopefully not)\n'
p2269
aS'[12:20] <Riddell> ricktimmis: sure\n'
p2270
aS'[12:20] <Mirv> but for historical reasons I think Kubuntu is a good home for Qt packaging ;)\n'
p2271
aS'[12:21] <Mirv> even though Qt is now used a bit here and there\n'
p2272
aS"[12:22] <ricktimmis> Riddell: thanks, So I have a script that downloads Sources, but many of them are not returned by apt-get sources instead it references Git, Bzr, Svn repos for the latest source archives. Does the script need to then download them from those archive, because if it does that's strike me as being a very difficult programming problem ?\n"
p2273
aS"[12:23] <ricktimmis> Riddell: What happens also, is that it seems plenty of source don't appear to have Watch files, so uscan returns nothing, does that matter ?\n"
p2274
aS"[12:24] <Riddell> ricktimmis: many packages will have lines saying where the packaging is held in vcs, that's only interesting if you're working on the packaging, for this script it needs to care about what's in the archive because that's what will be out of date\n"
p2275
aS'[12:25] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: I am working on the copyright file for tomahawk and i have come across a class file. this is the header of the class file http://paste.kde.org/665948/ should this file be ignored or else what should i take for copyright info\n'
p2276
aS'[12:25] <Riddell> ricktimmis: apt-get source will still do this even if it also says "please use bzr://foo"\n'
p2277
aS'[12:26] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: you can ignore that\n'
p2278
aS'[12:26] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\n'
p2279
aS'[12:26] <Riddell> ricktimmis: if they don\'t have a watch file then it should probably be added so your script should just say "missing watch file"\n'
p2280
aS"[12:26] <shadeslayer> it's an autogenerated file\n"
p2281
aS'[12:26] <claydoh> Mamarok: I think we should, numerous past incidents warrant it, methinks. Plus, he may get a better answer on hardware in one of his other crossposted lists. \n'

aS'[12:26] <Mamarok> claydoh: OK\n'

p2286
aS'[12:29] <Mamarok> done\n'
p2287
aS"[12:29] <ricktimmis> Riddell: Right, OK this has been very useful, thanks I shall carry on. I'm still a little confused by the output from apt-get sources, but the man pages will fix that, so leave it with me. Thanks again\n"
p2288
aS"[12:30] <Riddell> ricktimmis: when updating the package there's no reliable way to know if you should get the packaging from the archive or whatever version control someone keeps it in, but the point of this script is to keep the archive up to date so that's what it should do\n"
p2289
aS'[12:31] <Quintasan> mikhas: should I post to maliit-announce@lists.maliit.org ?\n'
p2290

aS'[12:35] <mikhas> well, send it to both\n'
p2294
aS"[12:36] <mikhas> I'll probably allow your e-mail ;-)\n"
p2295
aS'[12:37] <ricktimmis> Riddell: Ah right a little confusion again. Sudden thought, is the script comparing a local sources.list of packages against a local sources.list of source code. What I mean it should the script be doing apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, apt-cache redepends, apt-get source, test watch files, run uscan, output.

p2603
aS'[14:52] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: in the code sample from ealier you could technically drop the second bool b_video and instead use i_vout (int) in the expression eliminating the second line completely\n'

p2605

aS'[14:55] <apachelogger> I am reasonable certain msvc has that problem :)\n'
p2615
aS"[14:55] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: so my question is, why can't we just use if( b_old_video != b_video ) when both vars are boolean?\n"

p2751
aS"[17:33] <shadeslayer> I'm targetting it at 13.04, plan to finish it off at some point next week\n"
p2752
aS'[17:33] <xnox> right, on gtk side I am planning to drop it from gtk side. I will keep the generic bits upstream but not in the ubiquity package.\n'
p2753
aS'[17:33] <shadeslayer> oh\n'
p2754
aS'[17:33] <xnox> And when/if you are ready, I will add it back into -kde package.\n'
p2755
aS'[17:33] <xnox> If you still want to go with camera step.\n'
p2756
aS"[17:34] <shadeslayer> wait, so you're removing it because the KDE frontend doesn't have that step?\n"
p2757
aS'[17:34] <xnox> we did some usability testing, and it tested bad: people not looking pretty enough and feeling bad about themself.\n'
p2758

p2763
aS"[17:35] <shadeslayer> but if that's what user feedback says, I'll drop it too\n"
p2764
aS"[17:35] <xnox> I think it's a cool feature.\n"

p2768
aS"[17:36] <shadeslayer> but I don't want to go against user feedback :P\n"
p2769
aS'[17:36] <shadeslayer> I might actually implement the face chooser though\n'
p2770
aS'[17:36] <xnox> but kde installer is significantly different and can be nicer.\n'
p2771
aS'[17:36] <shadeslayer> the thing that sets ~/.face\n'
p2772
aS'[17:37] <shadeslayer> because that setting is fairly hidden IMHO\n'

p3022
aS'[13:07] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you could backport calligra to precise\n'

aS"[13:07] <Riddell> I've no interest in backporting to precise but it seems to be fashionable\n"

aS'[13:07] <smartboyhw> fashionable (LOL)\n'

aS'[13:07] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you could also test 4.10 on quantal and see if you get the crash Adityab is having\n'

p3043
aS'[13:10] <shadeslayer> Adityab: would it be possible to purge that PPA?\n'
p3044
aS'[13:10] <shadeslayer> and can you check if you can reproduce the crash with a new user?\n'
p3045
aS"[13:10] <yofel> smartboyhw: that's what VM's are for ;)\n"
p3046
aS"[13:10] <shadeslayer> so that we can confirm it's not some plasmoid that's causing the crash\n"
p3047
aS'[13:10] <Adityab> yeah\n'
p3048
aS'[13:10] <Riddell> especially since the crash is in QtScript, maybe some runtime stuff going on there\n'

p3106
aS'[13:37] <Riddell> smartboyhw: yeah you can either do that but then you need to make sure to kick me off first (and it means trusting amazon which not everyone likes to do)\n'
p3107
aS'[13:37] <Riddell> or you can just do debsign -R\n'
p3108
aS'[13:37] <Riddell> which is probably more sensible\n'
p3109
aS'[13:37] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ah\n'

aS'[14:20] <Riddell> smartboyhw: on your local machine\n'
p3118
aS'[14:21] <Riddell> it uses scp to download the .changes and .dsc files and signs them and uploads again\n'

aS"[14:24] <Adityab> shadeslayer: Ok, I trashed some plasma and friends' config files and it worked\n"
p3120
aS'[14:24] <Adityab> and... no crashes so far\n'
p3121
aS'[14:25] <Adityab> but then my firefox freezes completely from time to time\n'
p3122
aS'[14:26] <smartboyhw> Riddell, how come debsign -r wants to sign the key for Kubuntu Developers?\n'
p3123
aS'[14:27] <smartboyhw> Ah anyway found a solution\n'

aS"[23:20] <yofel> it's not like anything would remove it usually\n"
p3308
aS"[23:20] <amichair> then that's a bug in the upgrade path :-)\n"
p3309
aS'[23:21] <yofel> hard to say. It should be marked obsolete and proposed for cleanup usually\n'
p3310
aS"[23:22] <amichair> ok, removed it, now it's amarok-engine-xine, guarddog and ksensors showing errors coz they need it\n"
p3311
aS'[23:23] <amichair> do they have modern replacements?\n'
p3312
aS"[23:24] <yofel> xine is unsupported, but I don't know about the rest\n"

aS"[23:42] <amichair> why would kubuntu not need a firewall? sometimes ports get open, and you don't want them exposed to outsiders...\n"

p3639
aS'[11:54] <yofel> the broken part is the return value of ki18n\n'
p3640
aS'[11:54] <yofel> or it\'s ki18n crashing. As "aboutdata.addAuthor(ki18n("Sebastian K\xc3\xbcgler".encode(\'UTF-8\')), ki18n("Developer"), "sebas@kde.org", "http://vizZzion.org")" works fine\n'

aS"[11:56] <Riddell> you'd have thought python 3 would put an end to that nonsense\n"

S'[00:09] <BarkingFish> Evening guys :)  Just a quick "uh-oh" for you.  I\'m trying to commit an edit to bug 1023645 on launchpad, and it\'s consistently timing out.  I don\'t know if it\'s right down or just some technical probs.  Thought I\'d just give you a heads up in case you had anything to do on there :)\n'

p3903
aS'[08:52] <smartboyhw> lordievader, I did\n'
p3904
aS'[08:54] <lordievader> smartboyhw: Do you recognize this: after you had woken the laptop from its slumber, the case fan start to blow at 100% rpm, while there is no process hogging the cpu. The cpu is around 30 degrees btw.\n'
p3905
aS'[08:59] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'

p3914
aS"[09:01] <shadeslayer> yeah, reboot and check if it's still there\n"

However if I issue it with pm-suspend and then wake it up there is no problem. When I do the same on the compaq there is still the bug.\n'
p3928
aS'[09:22] <lordievader> Not sure what module to blacklist.\n'
p3929
aS"[09:24] <shadeslayer> I wouldn't really blacklist that module\n"

aS'[09:25] <shadeslayer> see http://www.linlap.com/hp-compaq_6730s\n'

p3933
aS'[09:26] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p3934
aS'[09:26] <shadeslayer> do you have fglrx installed?\n'

aS'[09:28] <shadeslayer> the intel stuff works great out of the box\n'
p3939
aS'[09:28] <lordievader> Yes they do, the whole laptop works great out of the box actually.\n'
p3940
aS'[09:29] <shadeslayer> I have no idea tbh, maybe #ubuntu can help\n'
p3941
aS"[09:30] <lordievader> Hmm does not fix it. Well it doesn't matter much to me, I just thought if this was occuring to more laptops it might be a bug with 13.04.\n"
p3942
aS'[09:31] <shadeslayer> nope, works fine for me\n'
p3943
aS'[09:31] <shadeslayer> except when virtuoso takes one entire core\n'
p3944
aS'[09:31] <lordievader> As it did on my other laptop.\n'
p3945
aS'[09:31] <shadeslayer> lordievader: might also be worth filing a bug against the kernel on launchpad?\n'
p3946
aS'[09:32] <shadeslayer> lordievader: actually, that happens only once or twice every 12 hours :)\n'
p3947
aS"[09:33] <lordievader> I ment that waking up without the fan going haywire works on the other laptop. I haven't seen any cpu spikes on 13.04 yet.\n"

p4036
aS'[13:58] <shadeslayer> if you use pbuilder it should automatically install those deps\n'
p4037

p4038
aS'[13:59] <shadeslayer> you need to have some of the things installed that debian/rules needs\n'

aS'[13:59] <shadeslayer> like pkg-kde-tools if you use the debhelper kde addon\n'
p4040
aS'[13:59] <shadeslayer> how else will debuild know what to do :)\n'

aS'[14:04] <shadeslayer> include /usr/share/dpatch/dpatch.make\n'
p4058
aS'[14:05] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: checking\n'
p4059
aS'[14:05] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so?\n'
p4060
aS'[14:05] <shadeslayer> and I see dpatch in Build-Depends\n'
p4061
aS'[14:05] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: it uses dpatch for patches\n'
p4062
aS'[14:05] <shadeslayer> instead of quilt\n'
p4063
aS'[14:06] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya\n'
p4064
aS'[14:06] <shadeslayer> ( guessing here )\n'
p4065
aS'[14:06] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so now dpatch have to be installed right?\n'
p4066
aS'[14:06] <shadeslayer> yes\n'
p4067
aS'[14:06] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: then how does launchpad automate it?\n'
p4068
aS"[14:06] <shadeslayer> well .. dpatch is installed because it's there in the build-depends\n"
p4069
aS'[14:07] <shadeslayer> so it gets installed with all the other Build Dependencies\n'
p4070
aS'[14:07] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: in that case why the error?\n'
p4071
aS"[14:07] <shadeslayer> because debuild doesn't automagically install the build-deps\n"
p4072
aS'[14:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: what should be done so that the debuild succeeds without errors?\n'
p4073
aS'[14:08] <shadeslayer> install dpatch\n'
p4074
aS'[14:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok i understood\n'
p4075
aS'[14:08] <shadeslayer> :P\n'
p4076
aS'[14:09] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: do people put this as a comment somewhere?\n'
p4077
aS'[14:09] <shadeslayer> nope\n'
p4078
aS'[14:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok\n'
p4079
aS"[14:10] <shadeslayer> if you're a maintainer, you usually have these tools installed\n"
p4080
aS'[14:10] <shadeslayer> for eg. the debian maintainer of mpich is comfortable with dpatch\n'
p4081
aS'[14:10] <shadeslayer> instead of quilt\n'
p4082
aS'[14:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok, i am preparing a chat with these comments for my personal purposes\n'
p4083
aS'[14:10] <shadeslayer> sure\n'
p4084
aS'[14:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: *chart\n'
p4085
aS'[14:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: one more doubt\n'
p4086
aS"[14:11] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: if someone is trying to package KDE but has gnome installed, I wouldn't expect him to have pkg-kde-tools installed\n"
p4087
aS'[14:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: right\n'
p4088
aS'[14:11] <shadeslayer> and s/he will hit the exact same issue\n'
p4089
aS'[14:11] <shadeslayer> sure\n'
p4090
aS'[14:13] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  when doing uupdate for a package the resulting folder downloaded contains the latest version of that software packaged to deb with the .dsc file and the original tar, so should i just upload it to my ppa?\n'
p4091
aS'[14:13] <shadeslayer> did you test build it?\n'
p4092
aS'[14:14] <shadeslayer> if it builds fine, sounds good\n'
p4093
aS"[14:14] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: haven't tested it\n"
p4094
aS'[14:14] <shadeslayer> Riddell: could you have a look at plasma-mobile?\n'
p4095
aS'[14:14] <shadeslayer> stuck in proposed it is\n'
p4096
aS'[14:15] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: upload to PPA and then test it?\n'
p4097
aS'[14:15] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thats what i thought :)\n'
p4098
aS'[14:16] <Riddell> shadeslayer: hum something about kubuntu-active\n'
p4099
aS'[14:16] <Riddell> but not sure what\n'
p4100
aS"[14:16] <Riddell> maybe it's sitll not installable\n"
p4101
aS'[14:16] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: Thats all now, build failed because of no disk space , going to try resizing my root , hope it will go smooth\n'

p4112
aS"[14:37] <gerlos> BluesKaj: right, I'm on 4.10\n"
p4113
aS'[14:38] <gerlos> BluesKaj: just disabled ALL the services for the right click menu, freezes seem gone, but right click menu doesn\'t appear "instantly", it tooks a 2-3 secs...\n'
p4114
aS'[14:38] <gerlos> BluesKaj: I suppose I have to do some trial and error to find the bad service...\n'
p4115
aS'[14:39] <BluesKaj> gerlos try resetting the menubar style in app appearance >fine tuning\n'
p4116
aS'[14:40] <gerlos> BluesKaj: it\'s already there. But I\'m using the "window menubar" plasmoid in a panel, may it be connected with the problem?\n'
p4117
aS'[14:40] <BluesKaj> I had the same symptoms yesterday ...I set the menubar to "in application" then rebooted \n'
p4118
aS'[14:44] <BluesKaj> gerlos , I just tried the window menubar in the panel , works ok \n'
p4119
aS'[14:45] <BluesKaj> no freezing when right clicking on files\n'
p4120
aS'[14:46] <gerlos> BluesKaj: right, disabling all the services averything seems to work fine\n'
p4121
aS'[14:47] <BluesKaj> you can also choose to have a menubar at the top of your screen , which is pretty neat ..set it in fine tuning \n'
p4122
aS'[14:47] <BluesKaj> disabling which services , gerlos ?\n'
p4123
aS'[14:49] <gerlos> BluesKaj: went to Settings -> Configure dolphin -> services and disabled everything\n'
p4124
aS'[14:50] <BluesKaj> gerlos, that seems rather drastic :P\n'
p4125
aS"[14:51] <gerlos> BluesKaj: right, but at least now we know that's one (or some) of those services fault...\n"
p4126
aS'[14:52] <BluesKaj> have you updated / upgraded today , gerlos ..also dist-upgrade \n'
p4127
aS"[14:53] <gerlos> BluesKaj: did it yesterday, I'll do it again now\n"
p4128

p4216
aS'[00:53] <ovidiu-florin> ScottK: ^\n'
p4217
aS'[00:56] <Riddell> ovidiu-florin: you need to run it on a netbook\n'
p4218
aS"[00:56] <Riddell> it'll run plasma-netbook instead of plasma-desktop\n"
p4219
aS'[00:57] <ovidiu-florin> I can just set that in a live session\n'
p4220
aS"[00:57] <ovidiu-florin> is the netbook necessary? isn't this enough?\n"
p4221
aS"[00:57] <yofel> not quite, unless someone fixed the default settings it'll be a bit different\n"
p4222
aS"[00:57] <ovidiu-florin> so, if I don't have a netbook, I can't test this\n"
p4223
aS"[00:57] <yofel> but I'm not sure on what we were regarding keeping that\n"
p4224
aS'[00:58] <yofel> well, you can force your VM into a small screen mode\n'
p4225
aS'[00:58] <ovidiu-florin> is that a good enough test?\n'
p4226
aS'[00:58] <yofel> should be (I think)\n'
p4227
aS'[00:59] <ovidiu-florin> Riddell: ^^?\n'
p4228
aS'[00:59] <yofel> I can test it later on my netbook here too\n'

aS'[00:59] <BarkingFish> Morning guys :)\n'

p4232
aS"[00:59] <BarkingFish> Quick question - i am aware of the plasma-desktop thingy with it crashing constantly on login - do you know if there's been a fix released for that bug please?\n"
p4233
aS"[01:00] <BarkingFish> I'm sitting here on 393mb of updates, and I'm nervous about applying them in case I wind up locked out of plasma.  But - I don't want the pile to get much bigger...\n"
p4234
aS'[01:01] <yofel> BarkingFish: the bug # would help...\n'
p4235
aS"[01:02] <BarkingFish> that's just it. You were the first one to mention it, and I can't find you in my scrollback :(\n"
p4236
aS"[01:02] <BarkingFish> You had the bug number, and I can't find it on a straight text search through launchpad\n"
p4237
aS"[01:03] <ovidiu-florin> yofel: what's the resolution of a netbook?\n"
p4238
aS'[01:04] <ovidiu-florin> or should I go directly with 800x600?\n'
p4239
aS'[01:04] <yofel> 1024x600 usually I think\n'
p4240
aS'[01:05] <ovidiu-florin> and the live session should start in netbook mode automatically on boot if the resolution is small?\n'
p4241
aS'[01:06] <BarkingFish> yeah - 1024 * 600 on a regular 10.1in, or 1080*720 on a hi-def netbook\n'
p4242
aS"[01:06] <ovidiu-florin> I'm testing with 800x600 right now, I'll with that after\n"
p4243
aS'[01:08] <BarkingFish> gotcha, yofel - i just found it in a text search here, right at the start of my scrollback from this channel :) bug #1117365\n'

aS"[01:11] <ovidiu-florin> ok, I can't find it. How can I force VB to force a resolution on the virtual Machine?\n"

aS"[01:14] <yofel> well, that's hardly surprising then\n"
p4256
aS'[01:15] <BarkingFish> did he finish the updates?\n'
p4257
aS'[01:15] <BarkingFish> you can resume busted updates to fix them before you do anything else\n'
p4258
aS'[01:15] <smartboyhw> Good morning:)\n'
p4259
aS"[01:15] <ovidiu-florin> I fixed it by finishing the updates, installing kde-workspace (it wasn't installed) and deleteing ~/.kde\n"
p4260
aS'[01:15] <BarkingFish> morning smartboyhw :)\n'
p4261
aS'[01:16] <ovidiu-florin> my presumption is that kde-workspace got uninstalled to be updated, but the battery died just before it managed to do so...\n'
p4262
aS'[01:16] <ovidiu-florin> or something similar to that\n'
p4263
aS'[01:17] <ovidiu-florin> could this be that bug?\n'
p4264
aS'[01:17] <ovidiu-florin> or a similar casE?\n'
p4265
aS'[01:17] <ovidiu-florin> this happened on a kubuntu 12.10\n'
p4266
aS"[01:19] <BarkingFish> ovidiu-florin, no.  This is basically you update to 4.10 and then everytime you try to launch plasma-desktop on login, it crashes out.  It looks kinda qt related, but I am very raw in kde's codebase. I know little and guess even less.\n"
p4267
aS"[01:19] <BarkingFish> I wouldn't touch this with thermal underwear and 12 inch thick gloves on.\n"
p4268
aS'[01:19] <ovidiu-florin> :)\n'
p4269
aS"[01:20] <ovidiu-florin> ok, I'll just test the installation, since I can't test the low resolution\n"
p4270
aS"[01:21] <ovidiu-florin> unless I change the host's resolution?\n"
p4271
aS"[01:22] <ovidiu-florin> nope, that doesn't work...\n"

aS'[01:27] <ovidiu-florin> how do I shutdown in netbook mode?\n'

p4500
aS'[13:01] <smartboyhw> Riddell, good news\n'
p4501
aS'[13:01] <Riddell> and Qt 5 seems to be in too\n'
p4502
aS'[13:03] <Riddell> or maybe only a couple parts of it\n'
p4503
aS'[13:03] <ovidiu-florin> on qt-project.org Qt5.0.1 is out allready\n'
p4504
aS"[13:04] <Riddell> ovidiu-florin: we know, that's why we want it in ubunut\n"

aS'[13:18] <Riddell> already 1 patch in qt 5 base (for maliit)\n'

p4518
aS'[13:19] <apachelogger> also the line makes sense\n'

aS'[13:19] <apachelogger> the 10 does not\n'
p4520
aS'[13:19] <apachelogger> Riddell: need to establish a policy ;)\n'
p4521
aS'[13:19] <apachelogger> also we still need a patch revu\n'

p4528
aS'[13:21] <apachelogger> well, technically also thread based, naturally\n'
p4529
aS'[13:22] <apachelogger> but you can have many qtimers in a single thread as this is not blocking as it is not using sleep()\n'
p4530
aS'[13:22] <apachelogger> you can even have many qtimers in one eventloop (what with it being a loop... ;))\n'
p4531
aS'[13:22] <yofel> ah ok, yeah, true in that regard\n'
p4532
aS'[13:25] <BluesKaj> Hi all\n'

aS"[13:46] <yofel> (that's 12.04 upgrading KDE 4.9.5 -> 4.10.0)\n"
p4549
aS'[13:47] <Riddell> was that the kmahjongg issue?\n'
p4550
aS'[13:48] <Riddell> the moved file without the conficts/breaks would have caused upgrades to fail\n'
p4551
aS'[13:48] <yofel> Riddell: https://launchpadlibrarian.net/130970860/history.log\n'
p4552
aS"[13:48] <yofel> that's apt's pre-upgrade dep resolver decision\n"
p4553
aS"[13:49] <yofel> and kmahjongg isn't even in the term.log, so that's not it\n"
p4554
aS"[13:50] <yofel> it's just apt's dependency resolver doing something stupid\n"
p4555
aS'[13:50] <Riddell> ug, nasty\n'
p4556
aS"[13:50] <yofel> Except that this is probably the 10th case that reached my eyes. And I can't reproduce it\n"
p4557
aS'[13:51] <Riddell> is it a   apt-get upgrade  instead of  apt-get dist-upgrade ?\n'
p4558
aS'[13:51] <yofel> upgrade would never remove/install something\n'
p4559
aS'[13:51] <apachelogger> Riddell: upgrades do not remove software\n'
p4560
aS'[13:51] <yofel> there is no apt command in the history\n'
p4561
aS'[13:51] <agateau> Riddell: latest homerun release is 0.1.1. Do you need a new one?\n'
p4562
aS'[13:51] <yofel> so I guess that was muon-upgrader\n'
p4563
aS'[13:51] <apachelogger> personally I think something in the dep chain is bugged\n'
p4564
aS'[13:52] <yofel> apachelogger: my guess too, but it would be some non-default package that acts as poison\n'
p4565
aS'[13:52] <apachelogger> yofel: does that happen on quantal too?\n'
p4566
aS"[13:52] <yofel> can't remember offhand\n"
p4567
aS'[13:52] <yofel> would need to search my logs\n'
p4568
aS'[13:53] <apachelogger> well\n'
p4569
aS'[13:53] <apachelogger> thing is\n'
p4570
aS"[13:53] <yofel> if it's just precise that would be apt/dpkg being really buggy there\n"
p4571
aS'[13:53] <yofel> which it is\n'
p4572
aS'[13:53] <apachelogger> iff active was already installed\n'
p4573
aS'[13:53] <Riddell> agateau: ok I thought there was a bug fix or update or something, maybe I imaginged it\n'
p4574
aS'[13:53] <apachelogger> that could be the problem\n'
p4575
aS'[13:53] <yofel> hm\n'
p4576
aS'[13:53] <agateau> Riddell: I have a few fixes waiting in the homerun/0.1 branch. When is Raring feature freeze?\n'
p4577
aS'[13:54] <apachelogger> yofel: no dpkg.log?\n'

aS'[13:54] <Riddell> no\n'
p4580
aS'[13:54] <Riddell> agateau: March 7th\n'
p4581
aS"[13:54] <yofel> apachelogger: I didn't ask for it, what does it give us that the other 2 don't ?\n"
p4582
aS'[13:54] <agateau> Riddell: ok thanks\n'
p4583
aS'[13:55] <apachelogger> yofel: dunno\n'
p4584
aS"[13:55] <apachelogger> it's not attached so I can't say what it would give us :P\n"
p4585
aS"[13:56] <yofel> well, it has more info on dpkg's status sequencing, which I wasn't really interested in\n"
p4586

aS'[14:23] <apachelogger> yofel: truth be told the only viable theory is that at least for that particular bug the dude installed kubuntu/plasma-active incompletely because deps were unresolvable then with 4.10 they become resolvable because we dropped some conflict/replace and his system broken int he way it should have broken to begin with\n'

p4704

p4726
aS'[16:35] <Riddell> ramiro_: want to help out making kubuntu?\n'
p4727
aS"[16:35] <ramiro_> i'm not so good at it\n"
p4728
aS'[16:35] <ramiro_> yes\n'
p4729
aS'[16:35] <ramiro_> that was what i was goint to tell you\n'
p4730
aS'[16:36] <Riddell> ramiro_: we need test installs of 12.04.2 if you want to dive straight in http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/254/builds\n'

p4735
aS'[16:39] <Riddell> great thanks\n'
p4736
aS'[16:39] <ramiro_> who makes the apps ?\n'
p4737
aS'[16:40] <ramiro_> i mean, i have an idea i would like to tell you about\n'
p4738
aS"[16:40] <ramiro_> (i'm really sorry if my english isn't great)\n"
p4739
aS'[16:40] <Riddell> ramiro_: most of our applications come from KDE, a separate but related project that makes end-user programmes\n'
p4740
aS'[16:41] <Riddell> your English is muchos bien\n'
p4741
aS"[16:41] <Riddell> what's your idea?\n"
p4742
aS'[16:42] <ramiro_> give me a minute (on the phone.... sorry) really important call\n'
p4743
aS"[16:44] <lordievader> I'll get a new usb-key tomorrow and test somemore 12.04.2 images :)\n"
p4744
aS'[16:45] <Riddell> great thanks lordievader \n'
p4745
aS'[16:46] <ramiro_> can i tell you now ?\n'
p4746
aS'[16:47] <Riddell> ramiro_: sure\n'
p4747
aS'[16:47] <ramiro_> as a university student it happens to me that i have a lot of papers o book in pdf. So it would be a great deal if there was a indexer for those pdf files\n'
p4748
aS"[16:48] <ramiro_> i'm at Universidad Nacional del Litoral, i'm studing computer engineer\n"
p4749
aS'[16:49] <ramiro_> so, my idea is yo develop a system that would do that for me. Labelling all my files and give me a quick search and look at them\n'
p4750
aS'[16:49] <Riddell> ramiro_: yeah that\'ll be "upstream" from kubuntu\n'
p4751
aS'[16:50] <Riddell> projects like KDE who code the software are called upstream\n'
p4752
aS'[16:50] <Riddell> and we compile it and try to ensure it all works and put it on a CD\n'
p4753
aS"[16:50] <Riddell> ramiro_: within KDE there's nepomuk which does indexing of most everything including PDF files\n"
p4754
aS"[16:50] <Riddell> so it wouldn't be hard to make a GUI which uses Nepomuk to index PDF files and show them to the user\n"
p4755
aS'[16:51] <Riddell> you could argue that Dolphin already does that\n'
p4756
aS'[16:52] <Riddell> and if you need a dissertation topic I can assure you that coding for KDE is a guaranteed A\n'
p4757
aS'[16:53] <ramiro_> what do you mean by "dissertation topic"?\n'
p4758
aS"[16:53] <ramiro_> (i'm writing my idea better for you)\n"
p4759
aS"[16:55] <ramiro_> yes, but as far as i know ... there is no app that gives me what i really need. Let me tell you an example: I have a folder where i put, and label, all my pdf files. I have some pdf that a haven't checked yet, so what i need is something that could store some data about them which makes my life easier when it cames to select just a few of them that have the information that i need at any moment. Let's suppose i want to lear python, so i have a lot \n"
p4760
aS'[16:55] <ramiro_> of pdf tagged, and i run a search for those who have the "python" tag, and can be a much more explicit search\n'
p4761
aS'[16:56] <ramiro_> as "python + unix" or whatever\n'
p4762
aS'[16:58] <Riddell> ramiro_: you can add tags to files in dolphin\n'
p4763
aS"[16:59] <Riddell> ramiro_: a dissertation is the project you do in your final year at university, I did mine on a KDE programme (Umbrello) and won an award for best in the country.  I'm surprised more university students don't do that.\n"
p4764
aS"[17:00] <ramiro_> oh, no i'm not on that right now... i just wanna help people :)\n"
p4765
aS'[17:00] <ramiro_> but , now that you tell me that ... it will be a good idea for me\n'
p4766
aS'[17:00] <ramiro_> thanks\n'
p4767
aS"[17:04] <ramiro_> i'm working on what i telling you ... can just give it to you, as a tester, when i have something define ? or isn't it possible ?\n"
p4768
aS"[17:05] <Riddell> ramiro_: sorry I don't understand\n"
p4769
aS'[17:07] <ramiro_> ok, i\'m working on this program. I don\'t have a "version" yet ... can i just let people test it once i have it working?\n'
p4770
aS'[17:08] <Riddell> ramiro_: are we talking about CD testing or your PDF indexing programme?\n'
p4771
aS'[17:08] <ramiro_> th PDF\n'
p4772
aS"[17:08] <ramiro_> oh, did we move on ? i didn't know that, sorry\n"
p4773
aS"[17:09] <Riddell> ramiro_: you can ask here but you'll probably have better luck in KDE which is where most of our programmes are written\n"
p4774
aS'[17:09] <Riddell> #kde-devel is their IRC channel\n'
p4775
aS'[17:09] <Riddell> you could also ask vHanda about what nepomuk can do to help\n'
p4776
aS'[17:12] <ramiro_> thank you, i really appreciate that!\n'

aS'[19:42] <yofel> fix the code\n'
p4805

p4806
aS'[19:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: something wrong with the code?\n'
p4807
aS"[19:43] <yofel> well, it doesn't compile\n"
p4808
aS'[19:43] <yofel> so start looking for where quarkMasses is supposed to be defined\n'
p4809
aS'[19:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i feel some package is missin g\n'
p4810
aS"[19:44] <yofel> or where it's supposed to come from\n"
p4811
aS'[19:44] <yofel> if a package would be missing you would probably get a missing header file error\n'
p4812
aS'[19:44] <yofel> though configure should tell you that usually\n'
p4813
aS'[19:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the code contains quarkMasses.empty() fn and from googling it yiels to 0 results\n'
p4814
aS'[19:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its a particle physics app and i like it \n'
p4815
aS'[19:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: should i send a message to the original maintainer ?\n'
p4816
aS'[19:48] <yofel> that or upstream\n'
p4817
aS'[19:48] <yofel> you can rule out packaging issues if you just do a local testbuild\n'
p4818
aS'[19:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what do you mean by rule out?\n'
p4819
aS"[19:49] <yofel> well, make sure it's not a packaging issue\n"
p4820
aS'[19:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: you mean ignore the package if it doesnt build?\n'
p4821
aS'[19:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so if its not a packaging issue and its a upstream issue, am i obligated to file a bug?\n'
p4822
aS"[19:51] <yofel> well, it's in upstream's interest that their software is shipped, so most upstreams are usually happy to cooperate if you have problems with building the software\n"
p4823
aS'[19:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats nice\n'
p4824
aS'[19:52] <yofel> if you maintain something you probably want to know where to find the developers\n'
p4825
aS'[19:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: thats right, i  thought of this when you were doing that, can you get me familiar with those developers?\n'
p4826
aS'[19:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: just what to know who is for what app\n'
p4827
aS'[19:53] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: with those I know sure, as for herwig: neither do I know what it is, what it does nor who develops it\n'
p4828
aS'[19:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i guess its a MOTO thing then?\n'
p4829
aS'[19:54] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: the archive package has an AUTHORS file, that should be good enough for a start\n'
p4830
aS'[19:54] <yofel> herwig++ is a MOTU thing in any case\n'
p4831
aS'[19:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: :) ok\n'
p4832
aS"[19:54] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: looking at it, I'm not even sure if it should be updated in ubuntu - unless you have a reason for it\n"
p4833
aS"[19:54] <yofel> so far it's just synced from debian\n"
p4834
aS'[19:55] <yofel> maybe instead ask the debian maintainer to update it in debian and sync the package again\n'
p4835
aS'[19:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: you mean that just for "herwig++" or for all the packages that are all out of sync?\n'
p4836
aS'[19:57] <yofel> herwig++ has no "ubuntuX" version, meaning ubuntu has nothing to do with the current package\n'
p4837
aS"[19:57] <yofel> in that case you should ask yourself if it's worth to let the package get out of sync with debian\n"
p4838
aS"[19:57] <yofel> as in that case you'll have to manually sync/merge it later\n"
p4839
aS'[19:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: Since i am not experienced, i am thing like " all the package should be in sync with debian"\n'
p4840
aS'[19:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: *thinking\n'
p4841
aS'[19:59] <yofel> well, they should be as close as possible. If syncing is possible that should be done\n'
p4842
aS'[19:59] <yofel> anyway\n'
p4843
aS'[19:59]  * yofel -> dinner\n'

aS'[20:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: enjoy the dinner \n'
p4845
aS'[20:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: good night , see you later\n'
p4846
aS'[20:16] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: another thing you could do is ask the debian maintainer if you can help with the updating, the might not mind reviewing your package and getting it into debian\n'
p4847
aS'[20:16] <yofel> that way both debian and ubuntu users would profit from your work\n'
p4848
aS'[20:18] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: its funny , i am already in debian-devel and told about you\n'
p4849
aS'[20:19] <yofel> ah, I doubt many people know me there :P\n'
p4850

p4851
aS'[20:20] <yofel> o.O\n'
p4852
aS'[20:20] <yofel> when did that happen\n'
p4853
aS'[20:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: it seems that that version of herwig is not yet in debian\n'

p4855
aS'[20:20] <yofel> they have what we have (or actually the other way around)\n'
p4856
aS'[20:20] <yofel> tip: this is useful:\n'
p4857
aS'[20:20] <yofel>  $ rmadison -u debian herwig++\n'

p4859

p4866
aS"[20:34] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i thought of this when i saw vHanda's blog, how can you revert a patch?\n"
p4867
aS'[20:34] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: prepare a new patch?\n'
p4868
aS'[20:34] <yofel> if you have rev1 and rev2, you make a diff between rev2 and rev1 (reverse diff) as a new patch and apply that to the package\n'
p4869
aS'[20:35] <yofel> in this case it was just a cherry-pick of commit b651f9231ac30072418bb06d602951f0f05da22c which already reverts 2f33141aa6716550e38b11ec9a0b000dd74eea79.\n'

aS"[20:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: haven't used format-patch yet\n"
p4879
aS'[20:43] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: it essentially throws out all commits between 2 revs as files, 1 file for each commit\n'
p4880
aS'[20:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this is nice\n'
p4881
aS"[20:44] <yofel> if you only give 1 rev it'll take the current HEAD as the second\n"
p4882
aS'[20:45] <yofel> where HEAD^ is HEAD - 1, HEAD^^ -2 etc.\n'
p4883
aS'[20:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so we can use this method to refresh patches?\n'
p4884
aS'[20:45] <yofel> that has nothing to do with refreshing patches. (at least not unless we put everything into git)\n'
p4885
aS'[20:46] <yofel> I guess you could do something similiar with bzr and UDD, but smartboyhw seems to be the UDD expert here\n'
p4886
aS'[20:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i remember you prepared a patch similar way for a package?\n'
p4887
aS'[20:47] <yofel> could be, it depends on the situation really\n'
p4888
aS'[20:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: you know for some very outdated versions like form 1.0.2 to 1.5\n'
p4889
aS'[20:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: *from\n'
p4890
aS'[20:48] <yofel> in that case I would first check what patches can be thrown away, then check what still applies and fix the rest by hand\n'
p4891
aS'[20:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p4892
aS'[20:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: to complete syncing before feature freeze i have to build 12 packages a day\n'
p4893
aS"[20:49] <yofel> which might require digging through the upstream VCS to find out why something was done, talking to upstream about it or even finding the person that originally wrote the patch to find out what it's supposed to do\n"
p4894
aS'[20:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: Is someone else is also working for this?\n'
p4895
aS'[20:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: that would be interesting\n'
p4896
aS'[20:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: the respective teams as shown in the maintainer field.\n'
p4897
aS'[20:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: you must be very experienced and know a lot of guys\n'
p4898

p5178
aS'[10:49] <shadeslayer> bleh :P\n'
p5179
aS'[10:50] <yofel> apachelogger: true\n'
p5180
aS'[10:50] <apachelogger> what realy puzzles me about the 10-04 log though\n'
p5181
aS'[10:50] <apachelogger> ...\n'
p5182
aS'[10:50] <apachelogger> it installed active-data, which is only depended upon by plasma-active\n'
p5183
aS'[10:51] <apachelogger> then he did exactly: install filelight; install a bunch of cli crap; (re)install muon; autoremove\n'
p5184
aS'[10:51] <apachelogger> and that autoremove removed active-data again\n'
p5185
aS'[10:52] <apachelogger> so I am really confused as to why first apt thinks it needs to install the pacakge without having anything dependent on it installed and then it realizes that it in fact does not need it and autoremoves it\n'
p5186
aS'[10:52] <apachelogger> it maks no sense\n'
p5187
aS'[10:52] <apachelogger> JontheEchidna: does muon do manual dep resolution such that an issue like that could occur ^\n'
p5188
aS'[10:55] <apachelogger> FWIW, for future bug reports it may make sense to look into a way to make kubuntu-desktop so important that apt will not dare but instead block\n'
p5189
aS'[10:55] <apachelogger> no clue how we can do it but looking at those logs it would be a good idea\n'
p5190
aS'[10:55] <apachelogger> getting -desktop removed twice without even having done a distro upgrade seems like a *really* bad thing\n'
p5191
aS'[10:55] <shadeslayer> mark it as essential?\n'
p5192
aS'[10:56] <yofel> was thinking the same, but that would at least not work during the first update\n'

p5195
aS'[10:56] <shadeslayer> also, have not shipped that single header, waiting for upstream to reply\n'
p5196
aS'[10:57] <apachelogger> yofel: why not?\n'
p5197
aS'[10:58] <apachelogger> in the october removal it was removed because muon was removed, whatever made muon go away should have been blocked by triggering the removal of kubuntu-desktop\n'
p5198
aS"[10:58] <yofel> apachelogger: we can't really make it essential in the archive? or can we? (I doubt)\n"
p5199
aS'[10:58] <apachelogger> in the feburary removal it was removed because workspace was removed, same thing as with muon\n'
p5200
aS'[10:58] <apachelogger> yofel: why not?\n'
p5201
aS'[10:59] <yofel> let me read the policy again...\n'
p5202
aS"[10:59] <apachelogger> don't care about the policy really :P\n"
p5203
aS"[10:59] <shadeslayer> isn't that what governs dpkg? :P\n"
p5204
aS'[10:59] <apachelogger> for all I care apt can be patched to never ever allow removal of kubuntu-desktop :P\n'
p5205
aS'[10:59] <shadeslayer> lol\n'
p5206
aS'[10:59] <apachelogger> well, unless done manual\n'
p5207
aS'[10:59] <apachelogger> my point is\n'
p5208
aS'[10:59] <apachelogger> it needs to happen\n'
p5209
aS'[10:59] <yofel> wel\n'
p5210
aS'[11:00] <yofel> *well\n'
p5211
aS'[11:00] <apachelogger> how it happens is implementation detail I do not give a rats booty about\n'
p5212
aS'[11:00] <yofel> I guess we could argue along the lines of "Packages which are necessary for the proper functioning of the system"\n'
p5213
aS'[11:00] <yofel> which matches "required"\n'

aS"[11:15] <Riddell> shadeslayer: I fear he's busy enough with qt 5 but maybe we could leech his qt 5 packaging for webkit and backport it to 2.3?\n"
p5249
aS'[11:15] <shadeslayer> possibly, but looks like an insane amount of changes to me\n'

aS'[11:18] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I have to hack on pgst a bit, would you like to take that up?\n'
p5253
aS'[11:18] <apachelogger> Since these packages cannot be easily removed (one has to specify an extra force option to dpkg to do so)\n'
p5254
aS'[11:18] <apachelogger> that is not the desired behavior\n'
p5255
aS'[11:18] <shadeslayer> or maybe I could have a look at it later this week\n'
p5256
aS'[11:19] <Riddell> shadeslayer: take up which?\n'
p5257
aS'[11:19] <apachelogger> we want it to be easy to remove, we do not want it to be disappearing in an upgrade\n'
p5258
aS'[11:19] <shadeslayer> Riddell: qtwebkit\n'

aS'[11:19] <yofel> apachelogger: what would be left is an apt pin >1000\n'
p5260
aS'[11:19] <Riddell> shadeslayer: needs Mirv to do it for qt 5 first no?\n'
p5261
aS'[11:19] <apachelogger> yofel: muon can do that\n'

aS'[11:19] <apachelogger> in fact\n'

p5265
aS'[11:19] <shadeslayer> already done?\n'
p5266
aS'[11:19] <apachelogger> muon could simply refuse to remove -desktop if it is not removed explicitly\n'
p5267
aS'[11:19] <Riddell> shadeslayer: I need to start looking at 12.04.2 and alpha 2 now\n'
p5268
aS'[11:19] <shadeslayer> okay\n'
p5269
aS'[11:20] <Riddell> shadeslayer: how far did you get using the existing packaging?\n'
p5270
aS"[11:20] <shadeslayer> haven't tried it\n"
p5271
aS'[11:20] <shadeslayer> oh wait\n'
p5272
aS"[11:20] <yofel> apachelogger: that won't help users of other package manager interfaces though\n"
p5273
aS'[11:20] <shadeslayer> Riddell: existing Qt5 packaging or the one in the archive?\n'
p5274
aS'[11:20] <apachelogger> I do not care\n'
p5275
aS"[11:20] <Riddell> shadeslayer: there's no existing qt 5 packaging\n"
p5276
aS'[11:20] <apachelogger> yofel: as I said, wait for JT\n'
p5277
aS'[11:20] <Riddell> shadeslayer: I was meaning the qtwebkit-source we have now\n'
p5278
aS'[11:20] <yofel> yeah\n'
p5279
aS'[11:21] <apachelogger> if worse comes to worse we make muon block on -desktop\n'
p5280
aS"[11:21] <shadeslayer> Riddell: but isn't this https://code.launchpad.net/~kubuntu-packagers/kubuntu-packaging/qtwebkit-opensource-src the Qt5 Webkit packaging?\n"
p5281
aS'[11:21] <shadeslayer> Riddell: nowhere\n'
p5282
aS"[11:21] <shadeslayer> mostly due to the fact that everything's changed I think\n"
p5283
aS'[11:21] <apachelogger> if people want the best experience they will have to use the tools we expect them to use\n'
p5284
aS'[11:21] <Riddell> shadeslayer: yes, not yet complete (probably just copyright to be done)\n'
p5285
aS'[11:21] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: and not aptitude\n'
p5286
aS'[11:21] <shadeslayer> Riddell: ah :)\n'
p5287
aS'[11:21] <apachelogger> for example\n'
p5288
aS'[11:22] <shadeslayer> I think alot of the Netrunner users use aptitude\n'
p5289
aS'[11:23] <yofel> interesting how hard it is to tell apt to not remove something...\n'
p5290
aS'[11:24] <shadeslayer> hehehe\n'
p5291
aS'[11:24] <apachelogger> well\n'
p5292

p5293
aS"[11:25] <Riddell> no it's not\n"
p5294
aS'[11:25] <Riddell> dist-upgrade with the DistUpgrade tool has policy\n'
p5295
aS"[11:25] <Riddell> it won't remove kubuntu-desktop\n"
p5296
aS'[11:26] <apachelogger> the entire system&policy is not made to support metapackages really\n'
p5297
aS"[11:26] <apachelogger> Riddell: that's explicit handling\n"
p5298
aS'[11:26] <Riddell> yes\n'
p5299
aS'[11:26] <yofel> aptitude safe-upgrade is a sane thing\n'
p5300
aS'[11:26] <yofel> except that it breaks on marble\n'
p5301
aS'[11:26] <Riddell> aptitude will use its different algorithms and come up with different decisions\n'
p5302
aS'[11:26] <apachelogger> my point is there is no consideration throughout the spec and implementation of a package that is really a crutch to the packagers\n'
p5303
aS'[11:27] <apachelogger> i.e. kubuntu-desktop other than a convenient point of entry for kubuntu installations is really a thing helping us to not have 3000 inter package dependencies to form the kubuntu stack\n'
p5304
aS'[11:28] <apachelogger> the stack is held together by kubuntu-desktop\n'
p5305
aS"[11:29] <apachelogger> if it gets removed, the stack falls apart, 'the system' mentioned in the policy is still working and all\n"
p5306
aS'[11:29] <apachelogger> it is simply not working for our target audience\n'
p5307
aS'[11:37] <Mirv> shadeslayer: not right the moment (qtwebkit 2.3), working on the qt5 + webkit indeed\n'
p5308
aS'[11:37] <shadeslayer> okay :)\n'

aS"[12:03] <apol_> well, I'm on 12.10 and i have the python file in a different place than what muon expects\n"
p5332
aS'[12:03] <apachelogger> hm, actually it is only broken for us because of if __name__ == "__main__":\n'
p5333
aS'[12:03] <apachelogger> how I hate python -.-\n'
p5334
aS'[12:04] <apachelogger> apol_: yeah, so we fix muon :P\n'
p5335
aS'[12:04] <apachelogger> and we fix the python\n'
p5336
aS'[12:04] <apachelogger> and all will be good :P\n'
p5337
aS'[12:04] <apachelogger> what puzzles me though\n'

p5339
aS"[12:04] <apachelogger> ScottK: didn't we have reports of people getting upgrade prompts to 13.04?\n"
p5340
aS'[12:04] <apachelogger> if those were running 12.10 the prompt is not from anything kde\n'
p5341
aS'[12:04] <apachelogger> oh\n'
p5342
aS'[12:04] <apachelogger> though checking should work\n'
p5343
aS'[12:05] <apachelogger> you could not upgrade though\n'
p5344
aS'[12:05] <apachelogger> man that is broken\n'
p5345
aS'[12:05]  * apachelogger scratches head\n'
p5346
aS'[12:06] <apachelogger> apol_: I think we need a meta-script\n'
p5347
aS'[12:07] <apol_> for running the KDE dist upgrade?\n'
p5348
aS'[12:07] <apachelogger> yeah\n'
p5349
aS'[12:07] <apol_> as in import; main() { run }\n'
p5350
aS'[12:07] <apol_> makes sense\n'
p5351
aS'[12:07] <apachelogger> yah\n'
p5352
aS'[12:08] <apachelogger> in py3 you cannot have relative imports in a non-package\n'
p5353
aS'[12:08] <apachelogger> and when calling just the one script it is a non-package\n'
p5354
aS'[12:08] <vHanda> Riddell: any idea if an updated nepomuk-core has been shipped? I sent a mail about this to the kde-packagers list.\n'
p5355
aS'[12:08] <apol_> nasty -.-\n'
p5356
aS"[12:09] <apachelogger> however since it is actually part of a package (i.e. DistUpgrade) you'd need if non-package: import foo, bar, foobar\\nelse: import .foo, .bar, .foobar\n"
p5357
aS'[12:09] <apachelogger> to keep both cases working\n'
p5358
aS'[12:10] <apachelogger> and then there is the problem that the stuff it imports again does relative imports...\n'
p5359
aS'[12:10] <apachelogger> so generally creating a metascript is the way to go IMO\n'
p5360
aS'[12:12] <Riddell> vHanda: updated in 4.10?\n'

aS'[13:19] <Mirv> qtbase is still a small question mark - I found some more RFC:s in there (among else the "bigfiles" by Internet Society) so they need to be removed from the orig tarball. however the bigfile:s are part of automated tests so I\'m building to see if those tests happen to be run and now fail.\n'

aS'[09:00]  * shadeslayer makes a release-team label\n'
p5768
aS'[09:00] <yofel__> duplicate those and merge on release?\n'
p5769
aS'[09:00] <yofel__> that sounds like a shitload of work\n'
p5770
aS'[09:01] <apachelogger> yofel_: yeah well\n'
p5771
aS'[09:01] <apachelogger> we could also switch to git :P\n'
p5772
aS'[09:01] <yofel__> still a shitload of work to merge 150 or so branches even with git\n'
p5773
aS'[09:02] <apachelogger> why would they need merging though?\n'
p5774
aS'[09:03] <apachelogger> my raring builder is broken -.-\n'
p5775
aS"[09:03] <yofel__> let's take the current nepomuk-core 4.10.0 branch\n"
p5776
aS'[09:03] <apachelogger> today is also a very nice day\n'
p5777
aS'[09:03] <yofel__> that has an upstream patch\n'
p5778
aS"[09:03] <yofel__> so the master branch can't build git\n"
p5779
aS'[09:04] <yofel__> one would need a branch with the patch removed to build git, and around 4.10.1 merge that into master\n'
p5780
aS'[09:04] <apachelogger> ohm\n'
p5781
aS'[09:04] <yofel__> OR\n'
p5782
aS"[09:04] <apachelogger> that's the wrong way\n"
p5783
aS'[09:04] <yofel__> you apply all changes again\n'
p5784
aS'[09:05] <apachelogger> master would always build git\n'
p5785
aS'[09:05] <yofel__> and what tracks the archive?\n'
p5786
aS'[09:05] <apachelogger> another branch\n'
p5787
aS'[09:05] <yofel__> so we have 2 after all\n'
p5788
aS"[09:06] <apachelogger> you don't get around a shitload of branches\n"
p5789
aS"[09:06] <apachelogger> it's just a question of whether the branches need manual merging which ought not be the case\n"
p5790
aS'[09:08] <yofel__> ah hm, yeah. I think I get what you mean\n'
p5791
aS'[09:08] <yofel__> I guess that would need a test run on a couple of packages\n'
p5792
aS"[09:10] <apachelogger> right now you'd probably have: master (building git master), 4.10 (building git KDE/4.10), 4.10-raring (branched from 4.10 some time ago carrying raring patches), 4.10-quantal (branched from 4.10 some time ago carrying quantal patches), 4.10-precise (branched from 4.10 some time ago carrying precise patches)\n"
p5793
aS'[09:10] <apachelogger> on 4.10.1 release the 4.10 branch is merged into all series branches (which in fact would be a fast-forward merge as there should be no conflicts)\n'
p5794
aS'[09:11] <apachelogger> i.e. the tricky part is to ensure that packaging is done in such a way that all supported/targetted series can be supported by the same upstream-tracking branch\n'
p5795
aS"[09:12] <yofel__> I'm against having the 4.10-quantal and 4.10-precise branches, our backports work well enough there, but otherwise +1\n"
p5796
aS'[09:12] <apachelogger> if that cannot be the case a major headache appears\n'
p5797
aS'[09:12] <apachelogger> yofel_: architecturally it is better to the have the branches anyway, even if they carry no changes\n'
p5798
aS'[09:12] <apachelogger> IMO\n'
p5799
aS'[09:12] <yofel__> ok, if you have some use for them\n'
p5800
aS'[09:12] <apachelogger> well, you never know\n'
p5801
aS'[09:14] <apachelogger> for all I care we can also just have 4.10-raring, but the requirement of one packaging to be able to cater all targets remains implicitly there\n'
p5802
aS'[09:15] <yofel__> which is rather impossible. Sure it works in neon, but even there I have some odd looking dependency workarounds to support multiple releases at once\n'
p5803
aS'[09:16] <yofel__> for quantal it might work. Precise is just nonsense\n'
p5804
aS"[09:16] <apachelogger> yeah, so you'd want branches\n"
p5805
aS'[09:17] <apachelogger> when a delta needs to be carried there is still a good chance an auto-merge will work\n'
p5806
aS'[09:19] <apachelogger> thinkin about it,sort-and-wrap may be a requirement at that point\n'
p5807
aS'[09:19] <yofel__> it would help at least\n'
p5808
aS'[09:19] <apachelogger> AFAIK the chances of auto-merging are way better to succeed on line-based changes\n'
p5809
aS'[09:20] <apachelogger> in fact I am reasonable certain git will be able to do that in just about all cases as long as one does not exchange half the deps in one commit ^^\n'
p5810
aS'[09:21] <apachelogger> yofel_: what I am unsure in all cases though is the changelog, it causes conflicts all and everywhere\n'
p5811
aS'[09:24] <yofel__> well. You could simply make it policy to never edit the stable branch changelog and instead fill it later during merge from the bzr diff\n'
p5812
aS'[09:25] <yofel__> would need changelog conformant log entries\n'
p5813
aS'[09:25] <yofel__> (which we currently do anyway)\n'
p5814
aS'[09:25] <apachelogger> yeah, I guess\n'
p5815
aS'[09:31] <shadeslayer> stupid ISP, I have 2 seconds of lag\n'
p5816
aS'[09:37] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: should I also backport the fix to the 4.8 branch\n'
p5817
aS'[09:37] <shadeslayer> or is it useless\n'
p5818
aS"[09:37] <apachelogger> technically useless but if it's no hassle I'd do it anyway\n"
p5819
aS'[09:48] <shadeslayer> wtf\n'

p5879
aS'[10:25] <apachelogger> he refuses to give it away, but if I had the SVG I could perhaps try to replicate the entire thing\n'
p5880
aS'[10:26] <shadeslayer> wat\n'
p5881
aS"[10:26] <Riddell> Mirv: the patches have comments which is great but I'm still scared of ending up like qt4 with dozens of patches nobody is quite sure what should be done with\n"
p5882
aS'[10:26] <apachelogger> i.e. the problem is that while the grey splash thingy could be shipped at 800x* and it would nicely scale up the new one does not\n'
p5883
aS'[10:27] <apachelogger> so what can be done is reuse the patterns and manually align them on a fixed color background such that it looks like the wallpaper without really being the wallpaper\n'

aS'[12:31] <murthy> yofel__: so we have to just copy from their ppa?\n'
p6021
aS"[12:31] <yofel__> apachelogger: I don't mind. But can we add a kind of transition animation for lightdm then? A hard change from plain blue or so to the background would be urgh\n"

p6024
aS'[12:32] <apachelogger> yofel__: no clue\n'
p6025
aS'[12:32] <murthy> why do you people take a clue from other OS ?\n'
p6026
aS'[12:32] <apachelogger> I really dunno what the animation would do\n'
p6027
aS'[12:33] <apachelogger> like there is nothing that would make the blue go away in any more reasonable fashion\n'

aS'[12:35] <yofel__> apachelogger: how about going with a black background with some sort of kubuntu logo?\n'
p6034
aS'[12:35] <yofel__> :D\n'
p6035

p6037
aS'[12:35] <apachelogger> I did not say the background should be blue :P\n'
p6038
aS'[12:36] <apachelogger> in fact it is hard to find a sensible blue :P\n'
p6039
aS'[12:36] <yofel__> yeah, that was just stuck in my mind\n'
p6040
aS'[12:36] <apachelogger> so it would probably a black with a hint of  blue\n'

p6042
aS'[12:36] <murthy> apachelogger: searching the video\n'
p6043
aS'[12:37] <apachelogger> what would probably look neat from an artistic POV is some sort of 3dish sin vs. cos thing\n'

p6055
aS'[12:41] <apachelogger> having 2 people spend half a year making a splash screen that on a SSD system you see for exactly 1 second seems not worthwhile\n'

p6057
aS'[12:41] <murthy> apachelogger: you should think different\n'

aS'[12:44] <murthy> apachelogger: no what i mean is ubuntu+gift warpping=mint\n'

aS"[12:44] <apachelogger> yofel__: though I'd have dropped the dots and instead had the bubbles animate\n"

aS"[12:45] <apachelogger> murthy: don't get your point\n"
p6067
aS"[12:45] <yofel__> well, the dots are classic, which does have it's style\n"
p6068
aS'[12:45] <apachelogger> so I should not go to mint, but mint does what the people want, so why would I not go to mint?\n'
p6069

p6070
aS'[12:45] <apachelogger> bubbles > dots\n'

aS'[12:46] <yofel__> apachelogger: like what? "Only for testing - the OS is still cooking"?\n'

p6082
aS"[12:46] <smartboyhw> murthy, who's the CEO?\n"

aS"[12:46] <apachelogger> so I'd have it actually spew bubbles\n"

p6087
aS'[12:47] <murthy> thats nice\n'

p6090
aS'[12:48] <apachelogger> yofel__: of subtle animations?\n'
p6091
aS'[12:48] <yofel__> what we have is a black background and the logo. How about making the logo larger and putting some kind of animation INTO it?\n'
p6092
aS'[12:48] <murthy> apachelogger: no i mean that to have an interactive one \n'
p6093
aS'[12:48] <apachelogger> yofel__: I tried logo animation it looks weird\n'

aS'[12:49] <apachelogger> did not try it on black, but animating the logo actually looks weird\n'
p6095
aS"[12:49] <yofel__> I didn't mean animate the gears itself. But we have space inside the gear circle\n"
p6096
aS"[12:50] <yofel__> making the gear parts glow would look nice, but that's probably rather hard to do\n"

aS'[12:52] <apachelogger> http://people.ubuntu.com/~apachelogger/screencasts/gear-rotate.webm\n'
p6098
aS'[12:53] <apachelogger> yofel__: dunno, "making them glow" can mean any number of things :P\n'
p6099
aS'[12:53] <murthy> apachelogger: looks traditional\n'
p6100
aS'[12:53] <apachelogger> generally not though, the glowery would be a different sprite\n'
p6101
aS'[12:53] <apachelogger> so for example they glowery can have different opacity and whatnot\n'
p6102
aS'[12:53] <apachelogger> should not be hard, depending on what you mean by glow exactly :P\n'

p6111
aS'[12:58] <yofel__> hm, we could show only the gear borders, then make one glow by filling it up and adding a bit of light shadow on the edges. Alternate that between the gears\n'
p6112

aS"[15:00] <murthy> shadeslayer: but isn't using vbios safe?\n"
p6326
aS"[15:01] <Mirv> Riddell: yeah, it's a beast like no other. the existing 500k of it already had repetition, but one choice indeed would be to have all copyright holders for all files having eg. BSD-3-clause in a same section\n"
p6327
aS'[15:01] <shadeslayer> the question is, what exactly is vbios\n'
p6328
aS'[15:02] <Mirv> Riddell: the addition is my best effort to make sure all ~significant copyright holders are listed, with a lot of grepping magic. I did not try to do a proper review on the existing 500k - there has been a lot of effort on that on Debian side last Autumn\n'
p6329
aS'[15:02] <murthy> shadeslayer: wait, i paste the reason\n'
p6330
aS'[15:02] <shadeslayer> okay\n'
p6331
aS'[15:05] <Mirv> I did check not to add any files that were already covered, so the additions are true additions. I started with the 2300 different copyright lines I got with some grepping, got first down to 1100 and then with comparing to which parties have already been covered to finally about 300 and then to 100 certain ones missing, of which I added those that seemed somehow significant\n'
p6332

aS"[22:17] <apachelogger> my pov: SSD setups ought to be the point of reference and there you don't really see the splash anyway\n"
p6645
aS'[22:17] <sheytan> and i aked  you if you see my blog spot, couse i want kinda background for the splash, installer and ldm, but i have to create it :D\n'
p6646
aS'[22:17] <sheytan> apachelogger: have an ssd too this times, and i know what you talk about\n'
p6647
aS"[22:17] <sheytan> but atleast don't make it black :)\n"
p6648
aS'[22:17] <sheytan> do it gray\n'
p6649
aS'[22:18] <sheytan> plus that circle i mention above. \n'
p6650
aS"[22:18] <apachelogger> people don't like grey\n"
p6651
aS'[22:18] <sheytan> you can do a demo atleast :D\n'
p6652
aS'[22:18] <sheytan> they do\n'
p6653
aS'[22:18] <sheytan> i do :D\n'
p6654
aS'[22:18] <apachelogger> that is to say I thought about making it an oxygen-style of grey\n'
p6655
aS'[22:18] <Quintasan> >oxygen style of grey\n'
p6656
aS'[22:18] <Quintasan> blue?\n'
p6657
aS'[22:18]  * Quintasan hides\n'
p6658
aS'[22:18] <apachelogger> blue looks weird\n'
p6659
aS'[22:19] <sheytan> apachelogger: can you show me the oxygen-gray one?\n'
p6660
aS'[22:19] <sheytan> blue not\n'
p6661
aS'[22:19] <apachelogger> not in kubuntu right now\n'
p6662
aS'[22:19] <sheytan> mail me please :)\n'
p6663
aS'[22:20] <sheytan> but what you generally think about havin one background for installer, ldm and ksplash and other for the wallpaper (which in this case we already have)?\n'
p6664
aS'[22:20] <sheytan> this will look more elegant\n'
p6665
aS"[22:21] <sheytan> i'm really tired looking on the same image everywhere. Same thing in the KDE apps. They use default wallpaper for each app main view.\n"
p6666
aS'[22:21] <apachelogger> hah\n'
p6667
aS'[22:21] <apachelogger> yeah I noticed that in kmail today\n'
p6668
aS'[22:21] <apachelogger> made me almost throw up\n'
p6669
aS'[22:21] <apachelogger> looks terrible\n'
p6670
aS"[22:22] <sheytan> that's waht i'm talking about\n"
p6671
aS'[22:22] <apachelogger> sheytan: apparently nuno has some great unified vision for plymouth-lightdm-ksplash for 4.11\n'
p6672
aS'[22:22] <sheytan> they suppose to use one standard backgrohnd\n'
p6673
aS"[22:22] <apachelogger> so personally I'd not invest too much into unification for kubuntu 13.04\n"
p6674
aS'[22:22] <sheytan> did you see it?\n'
p6675
aS'[22:22] <apachelogger> no\n'
p6676
aS'[22:22] <apachelogger> well\n'
p6677
aS'[22:22] <sheytan> :D\n'
p6678
aS'[22:22] <apachelogger> I saw the lightdm thing\n'
p6679
aS'[22:22] <sheytan> which has the 4.10 wallpaper as background\n'
p6680
aS'[22:23] <apachelogger> http://people.ubuntu.com/~apachelogger/screencasts/boot.avi\n'
p6681
aS"[22:23] <apachelogger> (mind the encoding is a bit broken so I'd download the file)\n"
p6682
aS'[22:24] <sheytan> i did\n'
p6683
aS'[22:24] <sheytan> but\n'
p6684
aS"[22:24] <sheytan> it's not bad\n"
p6685
aS'[22:25] <sheytan> one thing\n'
p6686
aS"[22:25] <sheytan> plymouth must have a logo in the middle of the screen. Not in the corner. I didn't see it in the first 5 sec\n"
p6687
aS"[22:25] <sheytan> we can use the Nuno's background\n"
p6688
aS'[22:26] <sheytan> but with the anim. you just made\n'
p6689
aS'[22:26] <sheytan> can you combine this?\n'
p6690
aS'[22:26] <apachelogger> yeah\n'
p6691
aS'[22:26] <sheytan> good\n'
p6692
aS'[22:26] <apachelogger> please talk to nuno about that first though\n'
p6693
aS"[22:26] <sheytan> plus i don't like the user list. It's too minimalistic\n"
p6694
aS'[22:27] <apachelogger> I think some framey thing is missing\n'
p6695
aS'[22:27] <apachelogger> surrounding the current entry\n'
p6696
aS'[22:27] <sheytan> yeah\n'
p6697
aS'[22:27] <sheytan> plus the clock i used in my ldm theme\n'
p6698
aS'[22:27] <sheytan> generally a clock and date is missing here\n'
p6699
aS'[22:28] <sheytan> and session switch\n'
p6700
aS'[22:28] <sheytan> :)\n'
p6701
aS'[22:28] <apachelogger> date I think we do not need, clock is useful tho\n'
p6702
aS'[22:28] <apachelogger> sheytan: yeah, since it is essentially a clone of the ubuntu theme, we should simply drag in their remaining design ... i.e. a frame around the current entry + some tiny icon to switch the session\n'
p6703
aS"[22:28] <sheytan> but it's cool to have such: Monday, 15th february | 11:23\n"
p6704
aS'[22:29] <apachelogger> in some languages that can easily be twice as long\n'
p6705
aS'[22:29] <sheytan> ppl use big screens these days :D\n'
p6706
aS'[22:29] <apachelogger> thing is... I often am at the login screen and wonder what time it is\n'
p6707
aS'[22:29] <apachelogger> I do not particularly wonder what date it is\n'
p6708
aS'[22:29] <apachelogger> let alone the weekday\n'
p6709
aS'[22:29] <sheytan> anyway, i belive Nuno will comeout with something for the session\n'
p6710
aS"[22:30] <apachelogger> like if I did not know the weekday I'd be worried ^^\n"
p6711
aS'[22:30] <sheytan> happens to me too\n'
p6712
aS'[22:30] <apachelogger> you should see a doctor :P\n'
p6713
aS"[22:30] <sheytan> doesn't happen that often :D\n"
p6714
aS'[22:30] <sheytan> yet\n'
p6715
aS'[22:31] <sheytan> anyway\n'
p6716
aS"[22:31] <apachelogger> ah well, we can't use being hung over as a use case after which our software should be designed :P\n"
p6717
aS'[22:31] <apachelogger> ah yes\n'
p6718
aS'[22:31] <sheytan> Nuno wants to have the theme for 4.11 and we release 13.04 in april which is going to be first\n'
p6719
aS'[22:31] <apachelogger> sheytan: reason why I did not put a logo in with the nuno background\n'
p6720
aS'[22:32] <apachelogger> ...\n'
p6721
aS'[22:32] <apachelogger> we cannot really nicely animate from plymouth to lightdm\n'
p6722
aS'[22:32] <apachelogger> so iff we want to go for the smoothest possible transition the elements found in plymouth ought to be present in lightdm\n'
p6723
aS'[22:33] <apachelogger> hence why I made the shutdown button breath, rather than slap a logo in the middle of the screen that then magically disappears\n'
p6724
aS"[22:34] <sheytan> i think that's the way it should be that a thing disappears. Why? Couse you're not in plymouth anymore\n"
p6725
aS"[22:34] <sheytan> that's not a big problem i guess\n"
p6726
aS'[22:35] <apachelogger> ScottK, Riddell: get the point of bug 1030022\n'
p6727
aS'[22:35] <ubottu> bug 1030022 in spectrwm (Ubuntu) "Port from legacy Xlib to to modern XCB" [Undecided,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1030022\n'
p6728
aS'[22:35] <apachelogger> ?\n'
p6729
aS'[22:36] <apachelogger> sheytan: that is inconsistent arguing, if we expect the user to know/care that there is a different piece of software that presents the bootscreen vs. the login manager then we can simply have different themes alltogether\n'
p6730
aS"[22:36] <apachelogger> otherwise we'd have to change amarok to not use a non-standard toolbar\n"
p6731
aS'[22:37] <sheytan> but till now we did it that yway\n'
p6732
aS'[22:37] <sheytan> way\n'
p6733
aS'[22:38] <sheytan> we had a kubuntu logo and that dots lighting\n'
p6734
aS'[22:38] <sheytan> then they did disappear and kdm showed up\n'
p6735
aS'[22:38] <apachelogger> yeah\n'
p6736
aS'[22:38] <apachelogger> and it was inconsistent\n'
p6737
aS'[22:38] <sheytan> a little bit\n'
p6738
aS'[22:39] <sheytan> windows has it that way, os x, and we did and nobody cares\n'
p6739
aS'[22:39] <sheytan> so maybe the disappearing logo will be not a bad idea :)\n'
p6740
aS'[22:40] <genii-around> Is this what causes the boot to just go grey with Kubuntu 13.04  and the progress dots in black each first boot after an update? The subsequent boots show the gears and correct background.\n'
p6741
aS'[22:40] <apachelogger> both also have insanenly minimalistic splashes, so we should go with that :P\n'
p6742
aS'[22:41] <apachelogger> genii-around: sounds more like something is wrong with your initramfs and/or upstart and/or plymouth\n'
p6743
aS'[22:41] <sheytan> yeah, welcome  back to the past ;D\n'
p6744
aS'[22:41] <Quintasan> besides\n'
p6745
aS"[22:41] <Quintasan> isn't investing time in that kind of pointless?\n"
p6746
aS'[22:41] <genii-around> apachelogger: Hm, OK. I did have to make a custom initrd\n'
p6747
aS"[22:41] <sheytan> it's not\n"
p6748
aS'[22:41] <Quintasan> most users install closed source drviers\n'
p6749
aS'[22:41] <xnox> "<sheytan> did you see my blog post about ubiquity?" link? =)\n'
p6750
aS'[22:41] <Quintasan> and that breaks plymouth\n'
p6751
aS'[22:41] <Quintasan> at least nvidia does\n'
p6752
aS"[22:42] <sheytan> Quintasan: doesn't break here\n"
p6753
aS'[22:42] <apachelogger> nvidia doesnt\n'
p6754
aS'[22:42] <Quintasan> what\n'
p6755
aS'[22:42] <Quintasan> why does my plymouth looks like crap?\n'
p6756
aS"[22:42] <apachelogger> intel doesn't\n"
p6757
aS'[22:42] <apachelogger> ati perhaps does\n'
p6758
aS"[22:42] <apachelogger> can't remember\n"
p6759
aS'[22:42] <apachelogger> shadeslayer would know muhahaha\n'
p6760
aS'[22:42] <Quintasan> apachelogger: you sure?\n'
p6761
aS'[22:43] <apachelogger> Quintasan: kinda\n'
p6762
aS"[22:43] <sheytan> i'm running on optimus right now and nvidia and intel work both great\n"
p6763
aS"[22:43] <Quintasan> this retarded closed source driver doesn't even support proper framebuffer here\n"
p6764
aS"[22:43] <apachelogger> I don't really see my splashes a lot\n"
p6765
aS'[22:43] <Quintasan> oh\n'
p6766
aS'[22:43] <Quintasan> great\n'
p6767
aS"[22:43] <Quintasan> it's another problem only I have\n"
p6768
aS'[22:43] <apachelogger> get an SSD\n'
p6769
aS'[22:43] <sheytan> on my PC with nvidia closed source works fine too\n'
p6770
aS'[22:43] <Quintasan> the driver says there is no 1920x1080 framebuffer\n'
p6771
aS'[22:43] <sheytan> but as apachelogger just said, SSD is to quick for this :)\n'
p6772
aS'[22:43] <Quintasan> and it uses some crap resolution\n'
p6773
aS'[22:44] <apachelogger> fortunately it is not too quick for kde login\n'
p6774

p6775
aS'[22:44] <apachelogger> which is somewhat disturbing\n'
p6776
aS"[22:44] <sheytan> it's not apachelogger\n"
p6777
aS'[22:44] <apachelogger> like it takes longer to login than it takes to start the OS\n'

p6876
aS'[08:27] <shadeslayer> dunno :P\n'
p6877

p6878
aS'[08:31] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, along with cantata:P\n'

aS"[08:31] <smartboyhw> Actually cantata needs waiting since it's NEW\n"
p6880
aS"[08:31] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, but yours' shouldn't\n"
p6881
aS'[08:32] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, in the Kubuntu Ninja pad "Plasma Active"section Why is plasma-active-maliit still on TODO?\n'
p6882
aS'[08:32] <smartboyhw> And actually, does that need an upgrade?\n'
p6883
aS"[08:33] <smartboyhw> Hi skaet haven't *seen* you much on IRC since 12.10 release\n"
p6884
aS'[08:33] <shadeslayer> hmm , probably because thats one of the new packages that we want to do\n'
p6885
aS"[08:33] <shadeslayer> but I don't remember the status of maliit\n"

p6890
aS'[08:34] <shadeslayer> if maliit is in, we can proceed with updating plasma-active-maliit\n'
p6891
aS'[08:34] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, I mean: Does "Plasma Active" section on the pad need an active with latest status?\n'
p6892
aS'[08:35] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, maliit is NOT in I think\n'
p6893
aS'[08:41] <shadeslayer> mm\n'
p6894

p6901
aS'[08:44] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: use a VM?\n'
p6902
aS'[08:45] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, I know. It would take me ages to do the upgrade. Also we need to do upgrades from Lucid!!!!!!?!?\n'
p6903

p6904
aS'[08:45] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, and I need to help Xubuntu too\n'

p7107
aS'[11:07] <apachelogger> technically what you need is a mock backend which actually does nothing to test libphonon, then you need a mock libphonon that does just about nothing but object construction and a mock version of vlc/gstreamer to test whether the backend behaves correctly\n'

aS'[12:20] <shadeslayer> sheytan:  http://paste.kde.org/671234/\n'

aS'[12:20] <shadeslayer> sheytan: install ubiquity-frontend-kde and then patch ubi-webcam.py\n'

aS'[12:20] <apachelogger> i.e. there is an insane amount of upgrade paths with our ppa releases\n'

aS'[12:27] <shadeslayer> atleast IMHO\n'
p7209
aS'[12:27] <shadeslayer> clubbing WiFi and codecs does not make sense\n'
p7210
aS'[12:27] <shadeslayer> plus, codecs should come after network selection\n'

p7219
aS'[12:30] <apachelogger> all with some sort of coherent coloring and shit\n'
p7220
aS"[12:30] <apachelogger> so I'd rather have a splash than wifi selection in ubiquity\n"
p7221
aS"[12:31] <smartboyhw> Riddell, looking at the code (ubuntu-seeds/kubuntu.precise), it just doesn't make sense it doesn't work\n"

p7223
aS"[12:32] <davmor2> shadeslayer, apachelogger: the codecs aren't just codecs it is also the installer for the proprietary wifi drivers so need to go before the wifi section\n"

aS"[12:35] <davmor2> shadeslayer, apachelogger: I've asked about it several time on the Ubuntu ubiquity version\n"
p7227
aS'[12:35] <apachelogger> in that case it needs to look different\n'
p7228
aS'[12:35] <apachelogger> should be a button "install me drivers, yo!"\n'
p7229
aS'[12:36] <apachelogger> anything other than that is simply silly\n'

p7285
aS'[13:02] <Riddell> right, uni and books will give you the simple applications\n'
p7286
aS'[13:02] <Riddell> anything complex needs experience\n'
p7287
aS"[13:02] <ovidiu-florin> Maybe I could make a minesweeper  replica, but  I'll get lost in the GUI..\n"
p7288

p7289
aS'[13:03] <ovidiu-florin> and it will take me a lot of time...\n'
p7290

p7342
aS'[13:30] <sheytan> we have a black screen with a glowing logo like you just did. Then we disappear the logo, fade-in the background and other ldm stuff\n'
p7343
aS'[13:31] <apachelogger> that could work\n'
p7344
aS'[13:31] <sheytan> yeah\n'
p7345
aS"[13:31] <sheytan> and this won't be disturbing couse the background is really dark\n"
p7346
aS'[13:32] <sheytan> it will look like we fade in only the noise effect from the background\n'

p7363
aS'[13:42] <Riddell> smartboyhw: yep\n'

p7369
aS"[13:43] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, you said you are doing the lucid -> precise upgrades how's it going!?\n"
p7370
aS'[13:44] <shadeslayer> slow\n'
p7371
aS'[13:44] <smartboyhw> Grrr\n'
p7372
aS'[13:44] <Riddell> agateau: oh cool, yes it is\n'
p7373
aS'[13:44] <agateau> Riddell: ok. Any hint on how to set things up to work on ubiquity?\n'
p7374
aS'[13:45] <shadeslayer> agateau: install ubiquity-frontend-kde and modify the files?\n'
p7375
aS"[13:45] <Riddell> agateau: there's a bunch of work items we also had for ubiquity\n"
p7376
aS"[13:45] <shadeslayer> it's all python\n"
p7377
aS'[13:45] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: http://i.imgur.com/K4PeYJs.png\n'
p7378
aS'[13:45] <agateau> shadeslayer: I mean: how do you test it?\n'
p7379
aS'[13:45] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh no. 26 min 27 s Hmmm.....\n'
p7380
aS"[13:45] <Riddell> agateau: if it's before the install step you can just do it locally but after you need to work on a virtual machine or a live system you don't care about doing the install on\n"
p7381
aS'[13:45] <shadeslayer> agateau: just run ubiquity from the terminal :)\n'
p7382
aS'[13:46] <shadeslayer> Riddell: you could also adjust the weighting so it appears before the install step\n'
p7383
aS'[13:46] <shadeslayer> see http://paste.kde.org/671246 for an example on how to do that\n'
p7384
aS'[13:46] <Riddell> aye\n'
p7385
aS'[13:46] <shadeslayer> er\n'
p7386
aS'[13:46] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/671234/\n'
p7387
aS'[13:46] <agateau> Riddell: I take it partitioning is before the install step\n'
p7388
aS"[13:47] <shadeslayer> agateau: yeah, though if you're hacking on the partition steps, a VM would be better\n"
p7389
aS'[13:47] <Riddell> agateau: well it is the install step so be careful :)\n'
p7390
aS'[13:47] <agateau> yeah, and I need a windows partition to reproduce it\n'
p7391
aS'[13:48] <agateau> "it" being the bug I am after\n'
p7392
aS'[13:48] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: 26 mins when I get a good download speed :P\n'
p7393
aS'[13:48] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, I saw it from imgur:P\n'

p7395
aS'[13:49] <Riddell> Mirv: qtwebkit committed, qtbase and qtdeclarative seem to already be there\n'
p7396
aS'[13:55] <smartboyhw> Damn real tired from at least 9 hours of testing\n'
p7397
aS'[13:55] <Mirv> Riddell: I think those are the rejected ones\n'
p7398
aS"[13:56] <Riddell> smartboyhw: don't burn out!\n"
p7399

aS'[14:03] <smartboyhw> Riddell, is it that we can skip Wubi?\n'
p7411
aS'[14:04] <ovidiu-florin> what is virtuoso-t ? (a process in System Activity hogging the CPU)\n'
p7412
aS"[14:04] <Riddell> smartboyhw: mm well I can't test it at least\n"

aS'[14:04] <Riddell> ovidiu-florin: ooh that waskely nepomuk\n'
p7414
aS'[14:04] <agateau> Riddell: do you have the url for ubiquity work items?\n'
p7415
aS'[14:04] <ovidiu-florin> can I kill it?\n'
p7416
aS'[14:04] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I think we need to skip it. NO testers at all\n'

aS"[14:05] <Riddell> smartboyhw: yeah likely, we'll need to beg skaet_ for forgiveness\n"
p7420
aS'[14:05] <ovidiu-florin> it came back\n'
p7421
aS"[14:05] <shadeslayer> ovidiu-florin: yeah, don't kill it, nepomuk will start it automagically\n"
p7422
aS'[14:06] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I think she will\n'
p7423
aS"[14:06] <shadeslayer> just let it do it's thing, it'll consume some CPU cycles for 20-30 minutes\n"
p7424
aS'[14:06] <shadeslayer> and then quiet down\n'
p7425
aS'[14:06] <ovidiu-florin> ah....\n'
p7426
aS"[14:07] <shadeslayer> if you want to completely kill it, you'll have to stop nepomuk, log out and login\n"
p7427
aS"[14:08] <ovidiu-florin> no, it's just that I can barely work....\n"
p7428
aS'[14:08] <ovidiu-florin> my CPU is always at 80% or more\n'
p7429
aS'[14:08] <shadeslayer> oh\n'
p7430
aS"[14:08] <smartboyhw> I really can't understand why a 14-year-old can survive through that many long hours of testing...I need to re-study Physics or Biology\n"
p7431
aS"[14:09] <shadeslayer> ovidiu-florin: can you run nepomukcleaner if you're on 4.10 once virtuoso-t dies down\n"
p7432
aS'[14:09] <agateau> Riddell: thanks\n'
p7433
aS'[14:09] <ovidiu-florin> shadeslayer: it calmed down now...\n'
p7434
aS"[14:09] <Riddell> smartboyhw: bah, it'll look much better on your CV being an elite kubuntu dev rather than getting an A in biology :)\n"

aS'[20:57] <apachelogger> sheytan: http://people.ubuntu.com/~apachelogger/screencasts/boot-glow-transit.webm\n'
p7764
aS"[20:57] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: that's how it works\n"
p7765
aS'[20:57] <shadeslayer> awesome :D\n'
p7766
aS'[20:58] <apachelogger> sheytan: note that I dunno if the transition will be as smooth.. that video is entirely qml\n'
p7767
aS"[20:58] <sheytan> apachelogger: that's not a big issue even if it's not ;)\n"
p7768
aS'[20:58] <sheytan> looks good\n'
p7769
aS'[20:58] <shadeslayer> indeedly\n'
p7770
aS'[20:58]  * apachelogger still does not like the glow\n'
p7771
aS'[20:58] <sheytan> but you did not make the background black :D\n'
p7772
aS'[20:59] <apachelogger> sheytan: because the nuno background is also not black\n'
p7773
aS'[20:59] <sheytan> you came out with the glow dude :D\n'
p7774
aS'[20:59] <yofel> hm...\n'
p7775
aS"[21:00] <yofel> the glow isn't bad, but why does the 1st stop glowing while the 3rd part is still glowing up?\n"
p7776
aS'[21:01] <apachelogger> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/02/14/plasma-desktopyJ2166.png\n'
p7777
aS'[21:01] <apachelogger> sheytan: why not background in plymouth?\n'
p7778
aS'[21:02] <apachelogger> yofel: because?\n'
p7779
aS'[21:02] <sheytan> apachelogger: i thought about it, but you propably will use the 800x600 res which will break the experience :)\n'
p7780
aS'[21:02] <apachelogger> nah\n'
p7781
aS'[21:02] <apachelogger> the background is a tile\n'
p7782
aS'[21:03] <sheytan> this will look good if you use the background in hi-res in plymouth\n'
p7783
aS'[21:03] <apachelogger> there is no high-res\n'
p7784
aS'[21:03] <sheytan> yet\n'
p7785
aS'[21:03] <apachelogger>         source: "lightdm/images/tilebg.png"\n'
p7786
aS'[21:03] <apachelogger>         fillMode: Image.Tile\n'
p7787
aS'[21:03] <apachelogger> no\n'
p7788
aS'[21:03] <apachelogger> there is litterally no high res because it is a tiling image\n'
p7789
aS'[21:03] <yofel> how large is that tile?\n'
p7790
aS'[21:03] <apachelogger> 200x200\n'
p7791
aS'[21:04] <sheytan> i cannot be, couse it has some lighter shadow inside of it\n'
p7792
aS"[21:04] <yofel> ok, that'll work as long as it crops instead of resizing\n"
p7793
aS"[21:04] <apachelogger> that's an overlay\n"
p7794
aS"[21:04] <sheytan> so having one tile won't do this effect\n"
p7795
aS'[21:04] <apachelogger> yofel: I doubt very much plymouth cares whether a sprite goes off-window ^^\n'
p7796
aS'[21:05] <sheytan> apachelogger: do you have that image somwhere?\n'
p7797
aS'[21:05] <sheytan> the tile\n'
p7798
aS'[21:05] <yofel> good then\n'
p7799
aS'[21:05] <apachelogger> that being said... it could still have performance implications\n'
p7800
aS'[21:05] <apachelogger> as plymouth has no native tiling\n'
p7801
aS'[21:06] <apachelogger> sheytan: yes?\n'
p7802
aS"[21:06] <sheytan> apachelogger: i've done some magic on my pc and puted 1080p background in /lib/plymouth as far as i remember right. It worked fine :)\n"
p7803
aS'[21:06] <snele> guys I think you should add "kubuntu" to the logo. I installed kubuntu 12.04 to a lot of people and they don\'t know what (distribution) they are using.\n'
p7804
aS'[21:06] <apachelogger> sheytan: of course it works\n'
p7805
aS'[21:06] <apachelogger> I even have code for native resolution lookup\n'
p7806
aS'[21:06] <sheytan> good\n'
p7807
aS'[21:06] <sheytan> we still wait for nuno ;.\n'
p7808
aS'[21:06] <sheytan> ;/\n'
p7809
aS'[21:06] <apachelogger> the problem is that the entire theme is put into one binary that is loaded before the kernel is loaded\n'
p7810
aS"[21:07] <genii-around> snele: I'm still getting a Debian logo :(\n"
p7811
aS'[21:07] <apachelogger> so it goes grub -> loads file -> file is some 100 mb big -> can take a while\n'
p7812
aS'[21:07] <apachelogger> which is why we used the 800x600 version of the aryia thingy\n'
p7813
aS'[21:07] <sheytan> 800x600 is maybe few kb less then 1080p\n'
p7814
aS'[21:07] <sheytan> in jpg\n'
p7815
aS'[21:07] <sheytan> is plymouth 100mb heavy?\n'
p7816
aS'[21:08] <apachelogger> no\n'
p7817
aS'[21:08] <apachelogger> native resolutions of a wallpaper are\n'
p7818
aS'[21:08] <apachelogger> that being said\n'
p7819
aS'[21:08] <apachelogger> if you put a bigger image in it will have to be scaled down\n'
p7820
aS'[21:08] <apachelogger> which then again slows down the boot\n'
p7821
aS"[21:09] <sheytan> but comeon. ppl don't that old machines anymore\n"
p7822
aS"[21:09] <sheytan> and if they do, they've got slack or gentoo on it without x\n"
p7823
aS'[21:09] <apachelogger> I did not talk about old machines\n'
p7824
aS"[21:13] <sheytan> so we don't have to care about boot time that much. If we have 2-3 sec diffrence, noboy will even notice tha.\n"
p7825
aS'[21:13] <sheytan> imho if we put background to plymouth it has to be atleast 1080p\n'
p7826
aS"[21:13] <sheytan> else it's a bad idea, couse it will look bad\n"
p7827
aS'[21:14] <sheytan> apachelogger: can you soruce me to that tile imge?\n'
p7828
aS'[21:15] <apachelogger> nope\n'
p7829
aS"[21:16] <sheytan> apachelogger: so how do  you know it's 200x200?\n"
p7830
aS'[21:16] <apachelogger> caused I looked at it\n'
p7831
aS"[21:17] <yofel> genii-around: for ksplash? if you still get 'joy' you'll have to change that in the config\n"
p7832
aS'[21:17] <sheytan> apachelogger: ok. lets wait till nuno will share the background with me.\n'
p7833
aS'[21:17] <sheytan> or i will do one by myself\n'
p7834
aS'[21:21] <genii-around> yofel: I changed to air now\n'
p7835
aS'[21:22] <apachelogger> sheytan: yeah, you could just cut a tile out of a screenshot :P\n'
p7836
aS'[21:22] <apachelogger> or something\n'
p7837
aS'[21:22] <sheytan> working on it ;)\n'
p7838
aS'[21:24] <genii-around> yofel: Sorry, "Default", my desktop theme is Air\n'
p7839
aS'[21:34] <phoenix_firebrd> Do i have to mention adding the missing files to the .install file in tghe changelog?\n'
p7840
aS'[21:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ^\n'
p7841
aS'[21:39] <apachelogger>             background.sprite[wSprites][hSprites] = SpriteNew();\n'
p7842
aS'[21:39] <apachelogger>             background.sprite[wSprites][hSprites].SetImage(background.tile);\n'
p7843
aS'[21:39] <apachelogger>             background.sprite[wSprites][hSprites].SetPosition(wSprites * background.tile.GetWidth(), hSprites * background.tile.GetHeight(), 0);\n'
p7844
aS'[21:39] <apachelogger> really somewhat mad if you think about it\n'
p7845
aS'[21:40] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: game?\n'
p7846
aS'[21:40] <apachelogger> yeah\n'
p7847
aS'[21:40] <apachelogger> plymouth2k\n'
p7848
aS'[21:40] <phoenix_firebrd> omg\n'
p7849
aS'[21:41] <phoenix_firebrd> you were serious\n'
p7850
aS'[21:41] <apachelogger> course\n'
p7851
aS'[21:41] <apachelogger> oh\n'
p7852
aS'[21:41] <apachelogger> lol\n'
p7853
aS'[21:41] <apachelogger> the logo will be fun\n'
p7854
aS'[21:41] <phoenix_firebrd> do you have a cast?\n'
p7855
aS"[21:41] <apachelogger> like in qml it's place that $root in center of center; place gears relative to the $root's x/y\n"
p7856
aS'[21:42] <apachelogger> fortunately in plymouth there is neither a center nor a relative x/y \n'
p7857
aS'[21:42] <apachelogger> phoenix_firebrd: what cast?\n'
p7858
aS'[21:42] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: video\n'
p7859
aS'[21:42] <apachelogger> does not compute\n'
p7860
aS'[21:42] <phoenix_firebrd> ok\n'
p7861
aS'[21:42] <apachelogger> ah\n'
p7862
aS'[21:42] <apachelogger> posted it ealier somewhere\n'
p7863
aS'[21:43] <shadeslayer> http://people.ubuntu.com/~apachelogger/screencasts/boot-glow-transit.webm\n'
p7864
aS'[21:43] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: you should at least mention that you edited it, somehow\n'
p7865
aS'[21:43] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: this is nice, simple and elegant \n'
p7866
aS'[21:43] <apachelogger> hm\n'
p7867
aS'[21:44] <apachelogger> anyone got a dualscreen setup with working plymouth?\n'
p7868
aS'[21:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok\n'
p7869
aS'[21:44] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: the black background is ok?\n'
p7870
aS'[21:44] <yofel> apachelogger: I think the last time I had 2 monitors attached it duplicated the splash\n'
p7871
aS'[21:44] <yofel> I think...\n'
p7872
aS'[21:45] <apachelogger> wondering right now...\n'
p7873
aS'[21:45] <apachelogger> oh\n'
p7874
aS'[21:45] <apachelogger> actually\n'
p7875
aS'[21:45] <apachelogger> this is fun\n'
p7876
aS'[21:45] <apachelogger> plymouth can have n windows\n'
p7877
aS'[21:45] <apachelogger> each with different dimension\n'
p7878
aS'[21:46] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: the effects timing has to be tweaked \n'
p7879
aS"[21:47] <apachelogger> and apparently pos(0,0) is in fact window[0]'s 0,0, whereas window[1] would perhaps be pos(800,0) \n"
p7880
aS"[21:47] <apachelogger> it's somewhat weird really\n"
p7881
aS'[21:47] <apachelogger> phoenix_firebrd: yeah, talk with yofel about that\n'
p7882
aS'[21:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ^\n'
p7883
aS'[21:48] <yofel> huh, I told you my opinion on the timing\n'
p7884
aS'[21:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what did you tell him?\n'
p7885
aS"[21:48] <yofel> <yofel> the glow isn't bad, but why does the 1st stop glowing while the 3rd part is still glowing up?\n"
p7886
aS'[21:49] <yofel> but thinking about it, that actually has some logic\n'
p7887
aS'[21:49] <yofel> we just only have 3 pieces\n'
p7888
aS"[21:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i see something different, the time of 2nd gear glow start is faster than the 3rd's\n"
p7889
aS'[21:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i should be equal to look like a chain reactiojn\n'
p7890
aS'[21:50] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: *reaction\n'
p7891
aS'[21:51] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ati issue solved?\n'
p7892
aS'[21:51]  * yofel watches again\n'
p7893
aS'[21:51] <shadeslayer> nope, I gave up\n'
p7894
aS'[21:51] <shadeslayer> anyway\n'
p7895
aS'[21:52] <shadeslayer> off to sleep I am\n'
p7896
aS'[21:52] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: good night, i am awake till 5 am :)\n'
p7897
aS'[21:52] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: in the 2nd animation run?\n'
p7898
aS'[21:52] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: can you paste the timings?\n'
p7899
aS'[21:52] <apachelogger> ..................\n'
p7900
aS'[21:52] <apachelogger> see\n'
p7901
aS'[21:53] <apachelogger> while you are wondering about how to make the timing not suck, I am wondering how to make the timing happen in plymouth\n'
p7902
aS'[21:53] <apachelogger> perspective people, perspective\n'
p7903
aS'[21:53] <yofel> good pint\n'
p7904
aS'[21:53] <yofel> *point even\n'
p7905
aS'[21:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  thats right\n'
p7906
aS'[21:54] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: forgot that\\\n'
p7907
aS'[21:54] <apachelogger> even more important... how to make the logo happen ^^\n'
p7908
aS'[21:54] <phoenix_firebrd> ya\n'
p7909
aS'[21:55] <yofel> *BLINK*\n'
p7910
aS'[21:55] <yofel> the ubuntu-logo theme is a plymouth patch o.O\n'
p7911
aS'[21:55] <phoenix_firebrd> are we shifting from our blue theme?\n'
p7912
aS'[21:56] <yofel> apachelogger: does plymouth have some kind of API docs or are you reading the source?\n'
p7913
aS'[21:57] <apachelogger> http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth/Scripts\n'
p7914
aS'[21:57] <apachelogger> reading the source is actually more useful than that ^^\n'
p7915
aS'[21:57] <yofel> fun\n'
p7916
aS'[21:58] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: this thing is old right?\n'
p7917
aS'[21:58] <yofel> wth is "progress" in plymouth context\n'
p7918
aS'[21:58] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: the ubuntu people have new direction for using qml in plymouth?\n'
p7919
aS'[21:59] <phoenix_firebrd>  I came across something about this , that were discussed in uds\n'
p7920
aS'[21:59] <apachelogger> hm?\n'
p7921
aS'[22:00] <apachelogger> using actual qml in plymouth ought to be somewhat ... difficult\n'
p7922
aS'[22:00] <apachelogger> perhaps redo plymouth using qml or something\n'
p7923
aS'[22:00] <phoenix_firebrd> apachelogger: searching for the post, may in omgubuntu\n'
p7924
aS'[22:01] <doctorpepper> hi guys!\n'
p7925
aS'[22:01] <phoenix_firebrd> nm\n'
p7926
aS'[22:01] <phoenix_firebrd> doctorpepper: hi\n'
p7927
aS'[22:03] <doctorpepper> is there any way to get detailed informations  about  plasma-desktop  memory  usage ?\n'
p7928
aS'[22:03] <sheytan> apachelogger: here i come\n'
p7929
aS'[22:03] <phoenix_firebrd> doctorpepper: in system activity\n'
p7930
aS'[22:04] <phoenix_firebrd> doctorpepper: right click plasma-desktop process and select "detailed memory informatiom"\n'
p7931
aS'[22:05] <doctorpepper> phoenix_firebrd: looked there but i dont get the detail i need  , i am looking to know why  plasma-desktop is  using a lot  of memory \n'
p7932
aS'[22:06] <doctorpepper> about 200M \n'
p7933
aS'[22:06] <phoenix_firebrd> doctorpepper: for programming purpose?\n'
p7934
aS'[22:06] <phoenix_firebrd> doctorpepper: i mean for debugging?\n'
p7935
aS'[22:07] <doctorpepper> kind of ,  i am trying to reduce  my kde memory  to a bare minimum \n'
p7936
aS'[22:08] <phoenix_firebrd> doctorpepper: use valgrind\n'
p7937
aS'[22:08] <sheytan> apachelogger: http://imageshack.us/a/img15/1741/bg1lo.png  http://imageshack.us/a/img577/9308/bg2ft.png\n'
p7938
aS"[22:08] <apachelogger> what's that?\n"
p7939
aS'[22:09] <sheytan> backgrounds\n'
p7940
aS'[22:10] <doctorpepper> by the way  i found  a bug ,  but  i cant  figure out  if its a kubuntu specefic bug.  the bug is related nemopuk  in the kcm u can set memory limit for the virtuoso-t process  i put it  to 75m but  still this process  use  up to 230M of memory \n'
p7941

p7946
aS'[22:13] <phoenix_firebrd> doctorpepper: you can file a bug report or you can ask the guys in the #nepomuk-kde channel about this\n'
p7947
aS'[22:13] <apachelogger> completely done in plymouth tho\n'
p7948
aS"[22:14] <apachelogger> doctorpepper: where's the mem usage number from?\n"
p7949
aS'[22:15] <doctorpepper> ksysguard\n'
p7950
aS'[22:15] <apachelogger> may be a memleak then\n'
p7951
aS"[22:15] <yofel> doctorpepper, phoenix_firebrd: for plasma, rather try #plasma - if they're in a good mood\n"
p7952
aS'[22:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya\n'
p7953
aS'[22:16] <yofel> memleak in some widget probably\n'
p7954
aS'[22:16] <apachelogger> how would that leak into virtuoso?\n'
p7955

p7956

aS"[22:17] <sheytan_> that's just my demo right now\n"

aS'[22:17] <apachelogger> k\n'
p7963
aS'[22:17] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: not that I know of, you probably mean strigi\n'
p7964
aS'[22:18] <phoenix_firebrd> ah , sorry\n'
p7965
aS'[22:18] <phoenix_firebrd> in that case no such process running in my system\n'

aS'[22:19] <phoenix_firebrd> doctorpepper: have you installed nepomuk-webminer?\n'
p7967
aS'[22:20] <phoenix_firebrd> sheytan_: does that outer right have a final glow?\n'
p7968
aS'[22:20] <phoenix_firebrd> sheytan_: after the 3 gear segment ?\n'

p7982
aS'[22:26] <sheytan_> ofcourse we would use the same background for ldm\n'

aS"[13:06] <yofel> actually no, there's too much grey everywhere\n"
p8295
aS'[13:06] <yofel> though it reached a tolerable level again\n'
p8296
aS"[13:07] <sheytan> to clarify, i;m not tired of blue that much, but i'm tired of color stuff everywhere. We need to go elegant and thank Nuno we have monochromatic icons in tray and plasma overlays etc\n"
p8297
aS"[13:07] <sheytan> to much colored stuff is not good too. It doesn't look professional then\n"

aS'[13:07] <murthy> yofel: you have a supporter \n'
p8299
aS"[13:08] <yofel> sheytan: I guess you have good eyes then. Mine aren't that good even with glasses, and making everything grey reduces usability\n"
p8300
aS'[13:08] <yofel> as it makes me slower in keeping the icons apart \n'
p8301
aS'[13:09] <BluesKaj> elegant is grey and mono colours ?... feels like a bait  for a debate \n'

aS"[13:09] <sheytan> yofel: i didn't tell you that everything should be gray. Only some parts of the desktop\n"

p8304

p8306
aS"[13:10] <shadeslayer> Riddell: not today I'm afraid\n"
p8307
aS'[13:10] <sheytan> we were talking about desktop in general\n'

aS'[13:10] <yofel> sheytan: the desktop in general as it is right now is ok I believe\n'

p8311
aS'[13:10] <yofel> :)\n'
p8312
aS'[13:11] <sheytan> and the same, i was tired of having kde default wallpaper everywhere in kubuntu. Installer, login, splash, wallpaper, even that central box in each kde app has it as background\n'
p8313
aS'[13:11] <sheytan> that was making me sick somehow :D\n'
p8314
aS"[13:12] <BluesKaj> system tray icons aren't merant to be fancy , they're just utilitarian indicators anyway \n"
p8315
aS"[13:12] <yofel> uhm, that's called consistency you know ^^\n"
p8316
aS"[13:12] <sheytan> that's why i'm trying to make kubuntu that way: a separate background for installer, login and splash and onther image for wallpaper. This will give us more elegant and simple look\n"
p8317
aS'[13:12] <apachelogger> sheytan: send me some other tile or whatever and I can make some more demos\n'
p8318
aS'[13:13] <shadeslayer> idk, having different backgrounds everywhere is inconsistent IMHO\n'

aS'[13:13] <sheytan> apachelogger: i will send you the logo with that circle around when i get home\n'
p8320
aS'[13:13] <sheytan> shadeslayer: not everywhere\n'

aS"[13:14] <sheytan> BluesKaj: well, we want to make a smooth switch from plymouth to lightdm. That's why we're trying to create new to fit with ldm.\n"
p8328
aS"[13:15] <sheytan> but it's hard cause we don't know what ldm will look like in upstream\n"
p8329
aS'[13:15] <sheytan> nuno is planning to release a new theme for kde 4.11 and for this time, i guess, we need our own ldm theme too\n'

aS'[17:23] <apachelogger> aka [] and String would be native classes\n'

aS'[17:24] <apachelogger> tho since those are implemented in C that statement is also not really true\n'
p8511
aS'[17:24] <apachelogger> anywho\n'

aS'[17:24] <apachelogger> so in plymouth you inherit by using the | operator\n'

aS'[17:27] <apachelogger> Foo is now a hashable Foo\n'
p8524
aS"[17:31] <apachelogger> ah in case it's not obvious why one inherits from global.Foo ... global.Foo is technically an object of its own, having functions as properties (e.g. Foo.Bar = fun() {}; is global.Foo.bar), as such inheriting from global.Foo allows one to use Bar as a function on an instance of Foo ... i.e. foo.Bar() works because foo is an instance of [] | global.Foo and global.Foo.Bar is fun() {};\n"
