p219
aS'[19:34] <Guest33547> i also have prooblem installing updates..\n'
p220
aS"[19:38] <TheLordOfTime> Guest33547, if you're on a live system without persistence you will always have to do that\n"
p221
aS"[19:38] <TheLordOfTime> i'm assuming yoru settings are also not being saved.\n"
p222
aS"[19:38] <TheLordOfTime> that's the nature of the live environment, unless you write the ISO to a USB with persistence.\n"
p223
aS"[19:40] <Snowhog> TheLordOfTime: Persistence won't help with application and/or kernel updates, yes? Persistence just allows you to save 'stuff' - downloaded items and such, doesn't it?\n"
p224
aS'[19:40] <BarkingFish> hi guys - does anyone know why so many of the ALT+SysRq keys have been disabled?\n'
p225
aS'[19:41] <TheLordOfTime> Snowhog, if persistence in the Kubuntu is similar to the Ubuntu/Lubuntu, it should save package updates\n'
p226
aS'[19:41] <TheLordOfTime> and i think it holds back kernel upgrades by default\n'
p227
aS"[19:41] <BarkingFish> You can't deliberately crash your system anymore - Alt+SysRq R (from REISUB) is blocked too, coupla others I used to use, like watching for blocked processes, etc\n"
p228
aS'[19:41] <Snowhog> BarkingFish: Which ones, and in what version of *buntu?\n'
p229
aS"[19:42] <BarkingFish> 12.10, Alt SysRq C, W and B, + some others I can't immediately remember\n"
p230
aS'[19:42] <BarkingFish> you try and do them in a terminal, you get "This SysRq function has been disabled"\n'
p231
aS'[19:43] <BarkingFish> *function/operation\n'
p232
aS'[19:55] <Guest33547> lord of tme, so it does or doesnt save updates... is trying kubuntu on usb like demo mode or something?\n'
p233
aS'[19:56] <Guest33547> it calls me live user and wont allow ,e to edit that to my name i settings\n'
p234
aS"[19:57] <TheLordOfTime> Guest33547, unless you used unetbootin or the USB startup Disk creator from an ubuntu system, it won't have persistence\n"
p235
aS'[19:57] <TheLordOfTime> at least last i checked\n'
p236
aS"[19:57] <TheLordOfTime> so that's why your updates dont stay nor your name changes\n"
