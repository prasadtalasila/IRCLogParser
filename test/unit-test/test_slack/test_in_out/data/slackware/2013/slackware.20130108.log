[00:00:12] <eviljames> well, it sorta does.  cheap pointer device vs. expensive pointer device.
[00:00:13] <ananke> you can get very very good logitech mice for example for more than $70
[00:00:13] <Urchlay> well they're not identical products, of course
[00:00:15] <Skywise> they're mice
[00:00:26] <ananke> Urchlay: not identical _technologies_
[00:00:28] <Urchlay> for most of us though, a mouse is a mouse
[00:00:29] <eviljames> but they're certainly not in the same class of pointer device.
[00:00:45] <eviljames> Hell, I don't think Logitech has anything that compares to the magic mouse.  At least, nothing that I've seen comes close.
[00:00:47] <pi31415> i've actually found the ball mice to be more reliable than the optical mice
[00:00:48] <Skywise> all the hype is jsut hype
[00:00:53] <ananke> 10 years ago you'd have the same false comparison between a ball mouse and laser one
[00:01:02] <pi31415> the optics often crap out after 2 or 3 years
[00:01:13] <eviljames> The name being the dumbest part, otherwise it's a pretty cool piece of tech.
[00:01:14] xdan779 (~xdan779@64.233.207.30) left irc: Quit: Konversation terminated!
[00:01:15] <pi31415> the ball mice need to be cleaned a couple times per year
[00:01:25] <eviljames> pi31415: just blow it out with canned air, the optics seem to wor kfine for me after that
[00:01:26] <ananke> pi31415: 'often'? perhaps on those $5 ones.
[00:01:29] <Urchlay> yeah, because a mouse is a mouse (ball, laser, magic beans, whatever the underlying tech actually is), to most of us
[00:01:31] <pi31415> the buttons are the weak spot on the ball nice
[00:01:45] <eviljames> I've been using the same logitech laser mouse for at last 5 or 6 years now
[00:01:52] <eviljames> s/last/least/
[00:01:54] <Skywise> if the cursor moves with the mouse, thats all the mouse i need
[00:02:01] <pi31415> i've seen some optical mice last longer than others
[00:02:04] <ananke> eviljames: i find this one to be very comfortable: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/performance-mouse-mx?crid=7
[00:02:24] <ananke> Skywise: and other people find value in additional features. the world goes on
[00:02:39] <Skywise> yeah, value thats it
[00:02:46] <Skywise> not fashion or ego
[00:02:48] <pi31415> anyhow $70 is a silly price for a mouse
[00:02:51] <Urchlay> ball mice are still optical (at least, all the ones I ever took apart, including ones from the 80s)
[00:02:58] <eviljames> Turns out Logitech *does* have a competitor to the magic mouse: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/touch-mouse-t620?crid=7
[00:03:07] <ananke> Skywise: as much as you'd like to believe, not everybody has those as priorities
[00:03:10] <Skywise> its like spending $70 for a pencil, i'm sure its got features a regular pencil doesn't
[00:03:18] <pi31415> ball mice are mechanical, little rollers contact the ball
[00:03:19] <Urchlay> the ball rotates a wheel with slots in it, the slots allow light to shine through
[00:03:29] <pi31415> the track balls are optical

[00:04:00] <ananke> Skywise: try a difference between a ballpoint pen and a good fountain pen
[00:04:05] <eviljames> I use an older one of these: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/optical-gaming-mouse-g400?crid=7
[00:04:13] <pi31415> Urchlay, I will have to take one apart to look at that
[00:04:25] <eviljames> ananke: Now that's a good comparison, but could you please make it about cars?
[00:04:38] <Skywise> a have a mont blanc and its only valuable because of its name, its not really a better pen
[00:04:39] <ananke> eviljames: but of course. a ford pinto and a honda accord :)
[00:04:47] <Urchlay> fountain pens are a pain, unless you've spent a long time learning to use one. Ballpoint = Notepad, fountain = vi or emacs, maybe?
[00:05:00] <Urchlay> (in other words, fountain = better but harder to learn & use)
[00:05:23] <Skywise> i think my space pen is a far better pen and its only $35

[00:05:32] <ananke> Urchlay: i'm not sure i'd call them harder to use, other than the required upkeep of providing ink
[00:05:41] <Skywise> it can write in space, under water, upside down, on walls and on grease and plastic
[00:05:50] <ananke> Skywise: ohh, how dare you have a $35 pen, when a $0.25 one is sufficient
[00:06:10] <Skywise> a .25 cent one can't write in space, it explodes in space
[00:06:12] <Urchlay> with my handwriting, it doesn't matter anyway. I'm left-handed, fountain pens are basically impossible to use without smearing and getting ink all over me. Erasable ballpoint is the same way
[00:06:17] <Skywise> they don't work underwater either
[00:06:21] <ananke> Skywise: and when was the last time you went in space?
[00:06:28] <Skywise> my mont blanc is worth over $500
[00:06:38] <Skywise> when i do go i'm ready with my pen
[00:06:39] <ananke> Urchlay: ouch. yeah, you're screwed either way
[00:06:58] <Urchlay> ananke: I was an early adopter of word processing, when I was a kid in school :)
[00:07:26] <Skywise> i consider the mont blanc jewelery in the shape of a pen
[00:07:30] <ananke> Skywise: but notice that you're the one comparing a fashion/designer piece to something else. we were talking about $70 pen, not $500
[00:07:50] <ananke> hyperbole argument
[00:07:53] <Urchlay> actually got points marked off for not turning in a rough draft of anything (because I didn't produce throwaway drafts that needed correcting, I just didn't print until the mistakes were fixed...)
[00:07:55] <Skywise> i'm saying one is for fashion, one is for function

[00:08:04] <Skywise> the mont blanc is pure fashion

[00:08:21] <Skywise> the space pen is functional
[00:08:30] <Skywise> i'm sure you can get the same features for less
[00:08:35] <Skywise> but since its apple its $$
[00:08:53] <ananke> Skywise: i'd be interested if you could find a touch interface mouse for much less than $70
[00:09:05] <Skywise> but i don't kid my self that the mont blanc is a good value
[00:09:16] <Urchlay> heh, anyone ever notice that, the more expensive a watch gets, the less functional it is? instead of numbers on the dial, they'll just have lines at 3 6 9 12, and really expensive ones have like a tiny jewel to mark 12:00 and nothing else on the dial...
[00:09:18] <ananke> i just showed you a link to a logitech mouse without those, priced at $100
[00:09:31] <pi31415> i have an apple ball mouse in the shape of a circle.  it looks like a flying saucer
[00:09:37] <Urchlay> a $100 logitech mouse would be a waste of money to me
[00:09:38] <pi31415> very ergonomic

[00:09:41] <ananke> Urchlay: because watches after you reach $100 or so price point, do become jewerly pieces
[00:09:42] <Skywise> Urchlay, unless its a casio
[00:10:01] <Urchlay> though I'd spend $100 to replace my kensington trackball (with the same make & model, if that were possible)
[00:10:41] <Skywise> i like my timex ironman its $45, and its got a timer and countdown timer
[00:10:41] <ananke> Urchlay: not to mention, they are valued for the intricacy of their mechanism, not functionality. automatic watches are much more expensive than quartz movement ones
[00:11:12] PaulB0 (~PaulB0@c-68-57-159-139.hsd1.va.comcast.net) joined ##slackware.
[00:11:17] <Skywise> watches that are status symbols are more focused on being recognizeable
[00:11:22] <ananke> while you can get some additional good features in watches up to $200-300, beyond that it's all about jewerly
[00:11:38] <eviljames> Nah, I need a $250,000 minute repeater, otherwise it just doesn't tell time
[00:11:49] <Urchlay> ananke: I'm just talking about the user interface. It gets harder to actually tell the time with them... surely a $500 watch with a jewel marking 12:00 would be worth $600 if it had 12 jewels instead?
[00:11:52] <Skywise> but who needs a watch when they have a cell phone
[00:12:24] <Skywise> i had a friend who was trying to impress me with his movado which only had a single dot at 12
[00:12:29] <ananke> Urchlay: actually, there is no rule or standard when it comes to that. you can get a blingbling watch for $5, all encrusted in jewels. and you can get $2000 watch, that will be very easy to read
[00:12:32] <Skywise> i was like why even have the dot
[00:12:39] <pi31415> who needs a watch when you stare at a computer all day long?
[00:13:03] <ananke> Urchlay: not to mention, what are you, a phillistine? can't tell time by looking at the hands, not numbers? :)
[00:13:03] <Urchlay> one theory: that kind of watch is for people who can afford to be late, so don't have to be able to tell time precisely :)
[00:13:05] <Skywise> my clock is down in the corner and my irc is time stamped
[00:13:07] <eviljames> Skywise: Did he mention that the watch probably cost more than his caR?
[00:13:20] <Skywise> i think it was fake anyway
[00:13:24] <eviljames> Likely he mentioned it several times
[00:13:58] <Skywise> but i don't even wear a watch anymore
[00:14:07] <Urchlay> ananke: eh, not really. My home planet is so primitive that they still think digital watches are a neat idea.
[00:14:09] <Skywise> frankly i don't like the bands
[00:14:20] <Urchlay> yeah, wearing a watch sucks
[00:14:42] <ananke> now, some timex pieces are interesting, such as their intelligent quartz line: http://www.timex.com/watches/intelligent-quartz-fly-back-chronograph-t2n495za
[00:15:23] <eviljames> If your website forwards me to a Canadian variant WITHOUT redirecting to the correct URL it pretty much guarantees I'll never come back.
[00:15:31] <eviljames> So long Timex, and fuck you very much.
[00:15:57] <ananke> indeed, that's stupid
[00:16:15] <ananke> although i'm a fan of timex. inexpensive, durable, usable watches
[00:16:29] <Urchlay> yah, that one looks like a serious piece of functional hardware
[00:16:58] <Urchlay> probably wouldn't actually deflect a bullet, but otherwise bulletproof
[00:17:41] <Skywise> besides, the certanty of the time is inversely proportional to the number of devices
[00:17:55] Action: ananke wears a simple timex that cost $18 new
[00:18:24] <ananke> ohh, and not to mention, most expensive automatic watches can't keep time as well as a decent quartz movement
[00:19:00] <pi31415> i bought a $2 quartz watch at the big box store when i was stuck in a snow storm 8 years ago, it works fine
[00:19:30] <Skywise> i like the indiglo watches, but their batteries are hard to replace

[00:20:17] <Urchlay> if I can't automate it with a script, I probably can't be bothered to do it manually every day :)
[00:20:22] <ananke> Urchlay: 'automatic' watches don't require manual winding
[00:20:37] <ananke> they are wound up by the movement of your hand
[00:20:41] <Skywise> just that you keep wearing them and moving around
[00:20:54] <Urchlay> yah, that'd work
[00:21:22] <Urchlay> as long as it doesn't die if I take it off before going to sleep
[00:21:23] <ananke> and they can store enough energy to last about 24-40 hours [varies]
[00:21:39] <Urchlay> sleeping with a watch on results in stinky wrist syndrome
[00:22:12] <Urchlay> I hardly ever sleep more than 24 to 40 hours, I'd be OK

[00:43:20] <BrokenCog> I'm reading Wiki's list ... more than I ever heard of.  I was hoping to hear from someone who uses them ... and has an opinion.  I'll probably try LiVES, it supports streaming.
[00:43:40] <Urchlay> (which doesn't stop the drummer from posting every last scrap of every gig or jam session on youtube for the whole world to see)
[00:44:09] <BrokenCog> same situation.  I'm actually just wanting to use it to chop parts off - the shaky bits while starting/stopping.
[00:44:21] <BrokenCog> although, not band related.
[00:44:53] <BrokenCog> huh.  Blender does video.  Did it always?!
[00:45:00] <Urchlay> sorta robs the spontaneity from a jam session, to know everything you do will be publically available on youtube the next day. What pleases an audience of 20-30 people might not be impressive to 20-30 million...
[00:45:24] <BrokenCog> isn't youtube a private session between you and one other?
[00:45:54] <Urchlay> eh? he used to post them privately (you had to subscribe to his "channel" to see them)
[00:46:07] <Urchlay> I dunno if he changed what he was doing or youtube changed the way it works

[00:47:22] <Urchlay> the original idea of recording everything was to watch it ourselves later, see what works, what doesn't, and what needs tightening up

[00:48:51] <Urchlay> "I've never played this song before, the guitar player has never even heard it, and neither of us have ever met the singer before, so of *course* it's a good idea to let the whole world see how great we sound playing it!"
[00:49:46] <Urchlay> ...and with crappy audio quality on top of that. Even a perfect performance would sound like ass, with a camera mic the size of a pencil eraser, 30 feet away from the stage
[00:51:07] <Skywise> you can't get an input from the mixer?

[00:51:35] <Skywise> it would be better to record each channel seperately tho
[00:51:36] <Urchlay> well, I have suggested that many many times
[00:51:59] <Urchlay> to record each channel separately, we'd need a much fancier recorder than we've got
[00:52:12] <Skywise> or more then one, but year
[00:52:35] <Skywise> do you guys all play midi instruments?
[00:52:51] <Urchlay> but yeah, if we could simply take the mixed line-out from the mixer & run into a jack on the camera, the sound would be way better
[00:53:28] <Urchlay> none of us play midi instruments... I play electric bass, the guitars are acoustic (with pickups) or electric, the drums are acoustic, and we ain't got a keyboard player

[00:59:04] <Skywise> yeah, i can imagine what it sounds like
[00:59:38] <Urchlay> it sounds like a band practice
[00:59:44] <Skywise> hehe
[00:59:45] <Urchlay> sometimes really good, sometimes not so good
[01:00:16] <Skywise> yeah, i guess thats why its special when a band knits together
[01:00:25] <Urchlay> and it's open mic, so after we do 4 songs, we start bringing up whoever's there to play (some of them come as bands, some are individuals)
[01:00:45] <Urchlay> sometimes I stand there & play bass the whole night because no other bass players showed up (it's OK, I get paid to do it)
[01:00:55] <Skywise> do they have sheet music for you or do they do covers
[01:01:00] <Urchlay> covers
[01:01:03] <Urchlay> or not
[01:01:07] <Skywise> lol
[01:01:25] <Skywise> hum a few bars and then off ya go

[01:02:02] <Skywise> lol
[01:02:40] <Urchlay> being able to fake it is a skill in & of itself, I've gotten pretty good at it (unless the song's really complex, you might watch me play it and never guess I didn't know how to play it...)
[01:02:56] <Skywise> well, jazz is all about improvisation
[01:03:07] <Urchlay> jazz? heh, I wish I could play jazz
[01:03:10] <Skywise> don't drop the beat and you can almost play anything
[01:03:24] <Urchlay> (not that anybody'd want to hear it, probably)
[01:03:41] <Skywise> it takes a lot of talent to get people to want to hear you
[01:03:54] <Urchlay> the difference between blues and jazz: In blues you play 3 chords for an audience of thousands. In jazz, you play thousands of chords for an audience of 3...
[01:04:05] <Skywise> yeah
[01:04:21] <Skywise> there is a drawback, but i think jazz shows are expensive too

[02:21:46] <oliver_> If I recall, SBCL (Lisp) likes 64 bit somewhat better than 32.  (I think it has to do with more registers, but I'm not sure)

[02:54:00] <nofra> XENSERVER!
[02:54:06] <KaMii> oopsies.....
[02:54:07] <ananke> this, of course, would be for my home server. on my laptop i use vmware fusion

[02:55:42] <nofra> ananke: You can run the simple cli console
[02:55:53] <KaMii> nofra: just install multilibs then virtualbox
[02:56:03] <nofra> or if you forward the right ports, you can run Xencenter
[02:56:10] <KaMii> then use vagrant
[02:56:20] <nofra> vagrant?
[02:56:30] <KaMii> oh you dont use vagrant?
[02:56:44] <nofra> ananke: The drawback is the FREE license has to be renewed once a year :(
[02:56:53] <KaMii> it uses the virtualbox kernel but in cli mode, so you dont have to use X

[03:07:56] <nofra> THAT looks like fun
[03:08:30] <pi31415> "Vagrant doesnt create a virtual machine instance completely from scratch. Instead, it imports a base image for a VM and builds off of that."

[03:09:41] <nofra> Skywise: Future customers too
[03:09:43] <pi31415> virtualbox provides the apis necessary to build a vm from scratch
[03:09:50] <nofra> As soon as they get some money
[03:10:10] <pi31415> i think vagrant is working around the fact that not every OS has a good way to automate the install

[03:56:21] <ananke> nginx is definitely a good choice
[03:56:26] <Adnauseam> any recommendations for sql ?
[03:56:32] <nofra> I've run apache on 128Mb
[03:56:38] <ananke> Adnauseam: depends on what you need. sqlite may be sufficient
[03:56:44] <nofra> Adnauseam: for eas: SQLite
[03:56:50] <Adnauseam> suppose wordpress is out fo the quesion ?
[03:56:53] <Adnauseam> question *
[03:57:03] <ananke> Adnauseam: with nginx? it will work
[03:57:17] <nofra> I LOVE SQLite
[03:57:20] <d4wnr4z0r> works very well with nginx, given nginx is setup correctly.
[03:57:32] <Adnauseam> hmm, sqlite + nginx + wordpress\trac sounds like a good spring project to me
[03:57:39] <d4wnr4z0r> which means: read the actual nginx documentation, *not* the random websites showing how to configure nginx for wordpress.
[03:57:41] Action: ananke is setting up nginx right now
[03:57:49] <Adnauseam> d4wnr4z0r: definitely
[03:57:58] <d4wnr4z0r> since most of the random websites mentioned are shit, are wrong, and/or are out of date.
[03:58:06] <ananke> trac is a bit lousy in the long run
[03:58:25] <d4wnr4z0r> you will have difficulties trying to do wordpress with sqlite, most likely.
[03:58:29] <ananke> and yeah, nginx has even a page dedicated to pitfalls, based on lousy documentation
[03:58:43] <d4wnr4z0r> indeed it does, which is a good read
[03:59:12] <Adnauseam> i'll get trac then
[03:59:30] <Adnauseam> it doesn;t really have to be wordpress, i just thought i can practice some plugin writing on this little server i got
[04:00:13] <d4wnr4z0r> you can do wordpress, but it does require mysql/mariadb/etc or you'll need some version hacked to work with sqlite or a plugin that does that
[04:01:35] <Adnauseam> i'll look into that and see what needs to be done so i can put this little machine to good use

[05:32:41] <vbatts> KaMii: the HTTP HEAD sayz it's a 2.2Gb download
[05:33:57] <vbatts> KaMii: after reading a little on the vagrant docs, which are more than they had when i put that minimal image together, it doesn't sound like it would be to rough to do it again
[05:34:21] <vbatts> it'd be nice to make tooling for an automated install/virtualbox image
[05:35:12] <vbatts> just get a virtualbox instance, export it, create a "vagrant config" and run a command to package it up into a *.box
[05:36:59] <KaMii> vbatts: well all i would like is to jsut get the installer to run on vagrant, that way, anyone can build their own slack on vagrant
[05:37:13] <KaMii> but im guessing vagrant doesnt work that way
[05:37:20] <vbatts> well,
[05:38:10] <vbatts> it wouldn't be too far off. have a /boot partition that includes the kernel and initrd from the install disc, and expect them to do a network install
[05:38:33] <vbatts> that's why i went with a minimal install
[05:38:36] <KaMii> or... have a standalone slackware installer vagrant box that can try to install to a blank box that you first create?  if thats even possible
[05:38:50] <vbatts> folks can always run the /var/log/setup later too
[05:38:59] <KaMii> yea

[05:39:17] <KaMii> but what about the size issue, can vagrant boxes be dynamic?
[05:39:22] <KaMii> or are they fixed sizes
[05:39:54] <vbatts> KaMii: have you messed around with virtualbox files?
[05:39:58] <elvis4526> Guys I have a question about removepkg. It does not even remove the entire packages. For instance when I remove httpd, it says that it has new files in /etc/httpd so it do not remove the dir
[05:40:06] <elvis4526> But hey, I didn't put any new file there.
[05:40:10] <KaMii> vbatts: not in that aspect, no
[05:40:33] <elvis4526> I remove it and reinstall it a lot of times, and it is always the same thing. Why it's like that?
[05:40:36] <KaMii> elvis4526: they were probably new config files
[05:40:52] <elvis4526> Yes, but they are coming from the package itself!!
[05:41:01] <KaMii> slackpkg new-config
[05:41:23] <elvis4526> no really, it's not a file with a .new suffix or anything
[05:41:23] <vbatts> when you create the "hard drive", you set it's size, and choose whether to grow or allocate. _most_ people choose 'grow', so i can have a 40Gb drive for a host, but if the fs is using only 200Mb, then the actuall virtualbox disk file, will only be 200Mb
[05:41:37] <elvis4526> it's the file that come with the package itself
[05:41:43] <elvis4526> For instance, if I remove the package
[05:41:46] <elvis4526> and I remove the directory
[05:41:50] <KaMii> vbatts: right, but doesn vagrant support that dynamic file system?
[05:42:16] <elvis4526> and I reinstall the package, the directory comes back with the file in it, and if I try to remove it, it won't remove the /etc/httpd because it "contains new file" X_X
[05:42:22] <vbatts> vagrant is just directly using virtualbox, so yes ;-)
[05:42:39] <vbatts> elvis4526: which files
[05:42:40] <vbatts> ?
[05:42:54] Haldrik (~haldrik@unaffiliated/haldrik) joined ##slackware.
[05:43:24] <KaMii> ok, so yea, all we need is to put the installer on /boot then tell people to run a net install or pull files from a dvd or some local folder on the host system
[05:43:58] branant (~bran@labs.maven.sc) joined ##slackware.
[05:44:22] <vbatts> KaMii: cheers, i'm off to ni'ni' ;-)
[05:44:41] <elvis4526> vbatts: for instance, /etc/gamin/gaminrc. I removed this package, I removed with rm -rf /etc/gamin manually because it wouldn't, I reinstalled gamin, and when I tried to uninstall it again, it wouldn't remove the /etc/gamin directory again because it "contains new files". But these "new files" came with the package
[05:45:10] <elvis4526> by "I removed this package", I mean with removepkg of course.
[05:45:42] <elvis4526> and then I did rm -rf /etc/gamin because removepkg wouldn't remove the directory.
[05:45:44] <elvis4526> Just to be clear.
[05:46:06] <shonudo> httpd down and try again
[05:46:47] <shonudo> it sounds like you're trying to remove something that's in use
[05:46:50] <shonudo> my 2 cents
[05:46:59] <elvis4526> I do not use gamin.
[05:47:15] <elvis4526> It's the same scenario for httpd. I never used httpd too.
[05:47:25] <KaMii> i have noticed this behavior in 14.0
[05:47:39] <elvis4526> I'm glad i'm not alone. :)
[05:47:45] <KaMii> but didnt really care so much, as it doesnt affect my system any
[05:48:17] <elvis4526> Yeah, most of the times, it's just text file. But when I remove something, I like to know that everything has really been removed.
[05:49:12] <KaMii> im wondering if packagetools is linking to 13.37 and thinks those 14.0 files are *new*
[05:49:24] <elvis4526> hmm...
[05:49:30] <KaMii> because i have only done upgrades to 14.0, i do not have a fresh install
[05:49:40] <elvis4526> Me, I did a fresh install.
[05:49:48] <elvis4526> So it's not this.
[05:49:52] <KaMii> then, that blows up that theory

[06:49:24] <slack_user> There is plenty of documentation for file transfers, and using data through your phone for your computer...
[06:49:33] <slack_user> but thats not what im looking for
[06:49:40] <KaMii> like on skype?
[06:50:45] <slack_user> No, like in a car that you have your cell phone paired to... you can answer your cell phone, and talk using the mic/speakers in your car
[06:51:06] <slack_user> i am looking to do that, but with my computer
[06:51:07] <KaMii> no, what i mean is, are you using skype on your computer?
[06:51:17] <slack_user> no
[06:51:23] <KaMii> what voip service are you using?
[06:51:34] <slack_user> ? None
[06:51:54] <KaMii> then how the fuck can you answer phone calls on your comptuer?
[06:52:06] <slack_user> How can you answer phone calls in your car?!
[06:52:20] <KaMii> i dont talk on the phone when i drive

[06:56:49] <KaMii> sounds like you will need to write a program to handle that

[07:13:56] <elvis4526> the bug with removepkg drives me crazy.
[07:16:05] <xocel_> in which do you refer?
[07:16:54] <elvis4526> removepkg does not remove all file of the given package
[07:18:51] <xocel_> depends on the package. if it creates files after install. removepkg doesnt know about them, so can remove them. I generally fix that by making the SlackBuild touch all those files. so they exist prior to install.
[07:19:06] <xocel_> if thats what you mean?
[07:19:17] <xocel_> cant*
[07:19:45] <elvis4526> Yes, but not in my case. For instance, install the gamin packages. You'll see the package create the file /etc/gamin/gaminrc.
[07:20:28] <elvis4526> Next step, try to uninstall the package gamin. It uninstall everything, except the /etc/gamin directory, because it says "it contains new file". But it is not new file, it was already part of the packages !!!

[07:24:19] MLanden (~MLanden@pool-108-26-97-249.nrflva.east.verizon.net) joined ##slackware.
[07:24:23] <xocel_> yeah i see what you mean
[07:25:05] <elvis4526> Nice. What do you think? After further inspection, it's because the file in the package is actually gaminrc.new at the beginning
[07:25:22] <elvis4526> and it get renamed to gaminrc if there is no gaminrc file already present
[07:26:13] <KaMii> because slackpkg issues a slackpkg clean-system during install
[07:27:00] <elvis4526> clean-system isnt just to remove non stock slackware packages?
[07:27:17] <KaMii> i mean new-config
[07:27:18] <KaMii> haha
[07:27:49] <xocel_> thats so when you upgrade a package it doesnt overwrite your config files. which would be nasty.
[07:28:04] <elvis4526> yes but know when I wanna remove it, it do not remove all of it.
[07:28:09] <elvis4526> it's nastier.
[07:28:10] <KaMii> yea, but thats probaly why its not getting removed
[07:28:20] <KaMii> slackpkg doesnt want to remove your config
[07:28:44] <KaMii> well i told you a few hours ago it was a config file
[07:28:55] <elvis4526> Yes but no.
[07:29:10] <elvis4526> It's just if you already have a gaminrc file, that you get the gaminrc.new
[07:29:19] <elvis4526> me i'm talking about when you have none of that.
[07:30:14] <elvis4526> On a standard scenario, i don't use gamin, I never used it, so i decide to remove it. For the moment, I'm stuck with useless config file when the package is supposed to be completely uninstalled. :/
[07:30:42] <KaMii> i dont see why its such a huge issue?
[07:31:10] <elvis4526> it is not a huge issue, it is just that in fact, the package isn't really removed entierely.
[07:31:19] <FLYSWATER> Ok
[07:31:28] <xocel_> the package management system is simple in nature. your asking a lot. it tells you if it does remove a file.. what more do you want? :P the behavior you suggest would bork peoples systems far to often
[07:31:34] <xocel_> doesn*

[07:33:01] <elvis4526> Yes, removepkg tell me what file it removes. But if one decide to remove the gamin package, I don't see why they would like to keep the /etc/gamin folder and it contents wich is certainly related to the gamin package anyway.
[07:33:23] <elvis4526> Sorry again for my english, my grammar is so horrible.
[07:34:16] <KaMii> because it doenst track changes to that folder after install
[07:34:46] <elvis4526> Yes I know, but in this case, I did not put anything myself in this folder.
[07:34:54] <elvis4526> The gaminrc file comes from the gamin package.
[07:35:04] <KaMii> and i would not want a it to waste my system resources tracking every folder for changes then spam me with popups all the time
[07:35:21] <shonudo> clearly we need a nukepkg function
[07:35:27] <xocel_> i understand what you mean. but its due to design reasons. when a package gets installed its simply extracted to your system. then a install script is run if it exists (doinst.sh). all files in the package are logged in /var/log/packages, removepkg uses that log to decide what to remove.
[07:35:37] <KaMii> shonudo: isnt that what rm -rf does?
[07:36:03] <xocel_> if the config file in the package is called config.new removepkg only knows about that one.
[07:36:05] <shonudo> sort of...
[07:36:12] <elvis4526> xocel_: yeah exactly!
[07:36:20] <elvis4526> if I do cat /var/log/gamin*
[07:36:24] <shonudo> but not as nice as nukepkg which only removes /etc and /usr
[07:36:30] <elvis4526> it lists /etc/gamin/gaminrc
[07:36:34] <elvis4526> .new *
[07:37:12] <elvis4526> This is why it doesn't get removed. But then, I have to track these kind of file manually. :/
[07:37:15] <KaMii> elvis4526: this is why slcakware is stable, it wont guess what it thinks you want it to remvoe
[07:37:58] <elvis4526> KaMii: I don't think it's a matter of guessing. If I decide to remove the gamin package, I don't see why I would like too keep the gamin directory in /etc.
[07:38:22] <elvis4526> I asked to remove gamin anways, why would i want to keep the folder in /etc ?
[07:38:28] <KaMii> elvis4526: then be a system admin for your box and administer it yourself and dont rely too much on a package manager

[07:38:52] <Demon_Fox> Do you know how to set abiword to double space certain paragraphs but not all of them?
[07:39:03] <KaMii> elvis4526: i like how it works now, because if I forgot to backup my custom config file, its still there after i did removepkg
[07:39:19] <shonudo> Demon_Fox??
[07:39:23] <elvis4526> A lot of other package managers are capable of handling these kind of issues, but it's not the question here, I still choose to use slackware over anything else.
[07:39:37] <elvis4526> Yes I understand KaMii
[07:39:38] <elvis4526> BUT
[07:39:46] <elvis4526> If you decide to removepkg a package
[07:39:55] <elvis4526> why would you want to keep a backup of your config file of this package?
[07:40:05] Action: KaMii sighs
[07:40:08] <elvis4526> You decided to remove it, you don't want it anymore, you throw it in trash.
[07:40:24] <elvis4526> Keeping the config file of this package is totally useless imo.
[07:40:31] <KaMii> elvis4526: ever hear of upgradepkg?
[07:40:40] <xocel_> elvis4526, its not a matter of what people like. its a matter of doing it in a way that will result in less chaos. a config file left on a computer is not an issue. you can remove it. or you can leave it and it wont break anything. overwriting someones config during an update, removing any changes they may have made to it could break that package. Therefore, it is done this way. deal with it.
[07:40:44] <KaMii> guess what it does first?
[07:40:58] <elvis4526> KaMii: removepkg
[07:41:02] <elvis4526> good point
[07:41:26] <elvis4526> But if we forget about upgradepkg, my point makes perfect sense. lol
[07:41:40] Nick change: [44] -> Slackology
[07:41:52] <KaMii> yea... i dont want that kind of package manager
[07:42:03] <xocel_> you could make a script that calls removepkg, reads it output, and removes any files that get left behind. that would save you the hassle.
[07:42:04] <elvis4526> KaMii: Some of them work really great. :)
[07:42:29] <KaMii> xocel_: or just give him a verbose option of removepkg
[07:42:45] <KaMii> so he can have fun hitting 'Y' or 'N'
[07:43:12] <elvis4526> no, but i would like to have the choice to delete config file with removepkg, yes.
[07:43:23] <elvis4526> aptitude provides this with ~C I think.
[07:43:49] <xocel_> aptitude provides many things..
[07:43:52] <xocel_> like herpes
[07:43:59] <elvis4526> hahaha :p
[07:44:01] <KaMii> then i suggest shonudo's idea, create a nukepkg and incorporate it into slackpkg
[07:44:22] <shonudo> and no shit, name it "nukepkg" to protect the rest of us

[13:24:57] <wizbit> on windows there is a option to do a full disk format or a quick format, what is the linux way of doing a full format?
[13:25:44] <ruskie> mkfs
[13:25:58] <wizbit> ruskie: that command can do a full format?
[13:26:04] <mikef> yes
[13:26:06] <wizbit> it always seem to do it quick for me
[13:26:35] <ruskie> -c     Check the device for bad blocks before building the file system. <-- just add that
[13:26:39] <rachael> never realized there was an autorun function in thunar-volman, wonder who thought adopting that windows feature was a good ideer
[13:26:57] <mikef> what do you mean by full format thiotu]]]
[13:26:59] <nofra> the thunar devs
[13:27:09] <mikef> *though
[13:27:47] <mikef> wizbit: what does full format do in windows that the quick format skips?
[13:28:27] <nofra> mikef: I believe it skips the checking
[13:29:05] <nofra> It just writes the table
[13:29:10] <nofra> IIRC
[13:30:05] <mikef> so all wizbit needs to immitate full format is to specify the check switch?
[13:30:53] <nofra> I hate to say this because I HATE RTFM people but, man mkfs.ext4
[13:31:09] <Zordrak> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/302686
[13:31:51] <Zordrak> Full is nothing more than bad sector check on top as stated above
[13:32:04] <Zordrak> Which equates to '-c' for mkfs.
[13:32:51] <rachael> well sadly it depends on what mkfs you run, xfs for instance doesnt have such a flag
[13:32:54] <nofra> Looks like -c is a write/read test so, my guess is that it will wipe the disc
[13:33:03] <Zordrak> s/mkfs/mkfs.ext4/
[13:33:35] <nofra> rachael: Who uses mkfs.xfs ???  :)
[13:34:27] <rachael> well I preferes to haev a filesystem that actual works, have had nothing but issues with ext4 all around
[13:34:28] <nofra> I guess we should ask again, what do you mean by 'full disc format'?

[13:36:12] <nofra> Hey! I resemble that
[13:36:25] <Zordrak> As you please sir, the facts remain :)
[13:36:57] <Zordrak> You'd not catch me doing anything but XFS on a 3TiB FS for example
[13:37:01] <nofra> Eh, even with 30Gb wasted, I have PLENTY of room for my Hello Kitty jpgs
[13:37:27] <nofra> Zordrak: why?
[13:37:34] <Zordrak> Hmm, yars.. and your Cadence simulation data?
[13:37:35] <nofra> <---haven't messed with xfs
[13:37:49] <wizbit> if a disk has some bad blocks and i did a full format with the -c option, will the hard drive BIOS mask those bad blocks?
[13:38:01] <nofra> BIOS?
[13:38:05] <mikef> Zordrak: does the amount of space used for inodes increase with disk size? how much would be used for a 3TiB disk?
[13:38:08] <Zordrak> s/BIOS/firmware/ s/mask/mark/
[13:38:16] <wizbit> yep
[13:38:39] Nick change: niels_ho1n -> niels_horn
[13:39:34] <Zordrak> mikef: relative amount.. ive never actually checked at that size.. i just go straight to XFS
[13:39:43] <mikef> ok
[13:39:54] <Zordrak> 500GiB+ == XFS for me personally
[13:40:13] <Zordrak> but usually I dont have OS disks in excess of 300GiB.. so I run Ext4 on / and XFS on additional large storage
[13:40:19] <nofra> 3TB and I'm running EXT3
[13:40:20] <mikef> when i get a drive 1Tib> i'l experiment and see

[13:42:18] <nofra> and 917G on the 1Tb drive
[13:42:42] <Zordrak> so.. youre giving 83GiB to Ext3 on md1

[17:56:26] <eviljames> adore: Yeah, if you're not running a very custom configuration, lots of extra SBo stuff, and so on, rsync ~ and start fresh IMHO.
[17:56:39] <FLYSWATER> wood_quinn, maybe you might withold your money from telepromters
[17:56:53] <eviljames> adore: While you're at it, experiment a bit.  make the following 4 partitions: windows (any size), swap (equal to your RAM at least), /boot (256M is plenty) and the rest for LVM
[17:57:10] <eviljames> adore: LVM will require you to make an initrd, but that's a fairly trivial affair once you get used to it.

[18:01:55] <goodjames> Layman's definition, resizable partitions.
[18:02:05] <goodjames> Then you can do more from there.
[18:02:11] <goodjames> Woops.

[18:02:18] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[18:02:21] <eviljames> You take a set of Physical Volumes (pvs) - which represent block devices. (/dev/sda1 or whatever)
[18:02:23] fnord0 (~fnord0@unaffiliated/fnord0) joined ##slackware.
[18:02:24] <adore> ah yeah, sounds fun actually from what i read between then and now... i dont have much invested in what I do here you know so, its all learning, fun
[18:02:32] <adore> much at stake i should say
[18:02:50] <eviljames> from your Physical Volumes, you make a Volume Group (vgs) of one or more pvs.
[18:03:13] <eviljames> vgs give you a decent software raid if you want, but I usually put the raid underneath LVM (ie: md raid5 w/ LVM on top)
[18:03:22] <eviljames> anyway, your vg gets a name, ie: chimera.
[18:03:32] <eviljames> Inside your VG you create Logical Volumes (lvs) - so, for example
[18:03:57] <eviljames> lvcreate -L 10G -n slackware-root chimera ; # creates /dev/chimera/slackware-root with 10GB size

[18:18:58] <eviljames> I didn't think the Surface had hit retailers yet
[18:19:09] <eviljames> Hence their reasons for cutting orders from 4m to 2m to 1m to 1/2m (IIRC)
[18:19:10] <Skywise> they hit and then fell down
[18:19:37] <eviljames> I was under the impression that they were retailing the MS Surface machines themselves (a-la google nexus or whatever) and everybody else got OEM Win8 machines (HP, Lenovo etc)

[18:21:43] <Cultist> I honestly believed that Windows 8 was just a rumor that hadn't been clarified by MS yet. I thought that right up until I happened to see Windows 8 sitting on a store shelf.
[18:22:05] <Cultist> I didn't think they would actually do that.
[18:22:19] <Nh3xus> They did it in Europe
[18:22:24] <Nh3xus> ppl got confused
[18:22:31] <Skywise> i knew win8 was real when ms tried to slip in an upgrade on win7 to wddm 1.2 thats only supported under win8
[18:22:55] <Nh3xus> also they want to make DirectX 11.1 exclusive for Win8
[18:22:59] <eviljames> No man, I've seen above average users (smart folks who aren't in IT) try to use win8 and it was painful to watch.
[18:23:04] <Skywise> yea
[18:23:24] <eviljames> The worst part is they start asking me questions
[18:23:34] <Skywise> win8 is unnatural, and its really only for consumers who want to watch things
[18:23:38] <Nh3xus> Yeah I've seen videos on Youtube of average no IT guys trying to figure out how to do stuff on Win 8
[18:23:39] <eviljames> ie : "Why is it that when I click the Mail tile that it loads for a minute then just brings up a blank screen?"
[18:24:02] <Nh3xus> painful to watch too
[18:24:04] <Cultist> I played with the demo computer at the store for a bit. I work in an IT section and in the five minutes I was on it I couldn't figure out what I was doing
[18:24:08] <eviljames> first answer: "pft, no clue.".. after working with the machine, they had a hidden menu you apparently have to right click on the right hand side of the screen to bring up to add accounts.

[18:25:33] <Nh3xus> yes they locked all ARM UEFI with the Secure Boot

[18:27:10] <Skywise> no you are
[18:27:15] <eviljames> now, contrast with how many ARM-based LINUX machines are out there.
[18:27:21] <Skywise> no you do it
[18:27:42] <eviljames> Sure, the ratio is probably somewhere in the 10,000 : 1 :: Linux : MS range.
[18:27:49] <eviljames> If it's not 1,000,000 to 1
[18:27:50] <Nh3xus> The x86_64 machine do have secure boot too
[18:27:55] <Skywise> ms doesn't care what people are doing, they just wanna lock in the major manufacturers
[18:28:12] <eviljames> x86 it can be disabled.
[18:28:14] <eviljames> by spec.
[18:28:20] <Nh3xus> Yes hopefully
[18:28:25] <Skywise> but then you can't boot windows
[18:28:26] <eviljames> Not hopefully, that's part of the UEFI spec.
[18:28:32] <eviljames> Skywise: who gives a rat shit?
[18:28:39] <Skywise> it essentially destroys dual booting
[18:28:47] <Nh3xus> Canonical and the Fedora team bought some unlock keys to make their distro able to run on such machines

[19:44:58] <Urchlay> native VSTs on linux aren't a hack... but there aren't many of them

[19:45:19] <Urchlay> (mostly people mean running windows VSTs with a wine-based wrapper, which *is* a hack)

[19:45:39] <Urchlay> is studioware on the new LV2 stack yet? (lilv, serd, sord)
[19:45:53] <eviljames> Urchlay: 14.0 plans.  I'm cleaning house and dropping a lot of old software where possible.
[19:47:04] <Urchlay> yeah. For SBo it's going to be a mess... most stuff will require changes by its maintainer for the new lv2 stack (and said maintainer might not be interested in migrating)
[19:47:12] <Skywise> theres alot of stuff dependend on cyrus-sasl, that i wouldn't of expected
[19:47:21] <Nh3xus> eviljames: Now that's sweet. A complete chain of software bundled for Slack
[19:47:56] <eviljames> Nh3xus: yeah, like I said, it's suffering from a bit of bitrot right now (as I've been busy with other projects)
[19:48:05] <eviljames> but an update _is_ forthcoming, and it _will_ be awesome..
[19:48:21] <eviljames> ok, it may not be awesome, but it'll be pretty good... well, it might be total crap.  Try it when it's released and find out! :D
[19:48:41] <eviljames> notKlaatu maintains a lot of great info as well with Slackermedia
[19:49:03] <Nh3xus> Ok. I wonder if a 32 bits Slack is strong enough for that kind of use. Run out of RAM quickly ?
[19:49:31] <eviljames> Nh3xus: Yes and no.  Depends on how much ram you have and how intense the processing you want to do is.

[19:51:51] <eviljames> nah, a laptop + decent external interface (fw/usb2) works great.

[19:52:40] <eviljames> Definitely.  Tascam, M-Audio, something from the low end of the pro-audio gear in your local music store will do for basement/apartment use.
[19:52:56] eleksir (~Eleksir@195.91.245.241) joined ##slackware.
[19:53:09] <Urchlay> I've come to the conclusion though... if you can possibly afford firewire, use it. USB sucks.
[19:53:23] <eviljames> I had a $100 Tascam US-100 that worked perfectly with slackware/studioware stuff.  Presented a generic USB-Audio interface and could hit 5ms latency w/o xruns
[19:53:26] <Nh3xus> I see. I think I can have a better bandwidth with my 1394 firewire than my usb 2.0 ports
[19:53:40] <Urchlay> bandwidth isn't really the problem... latency is
[19:53:41] <eviljames> Urchlay: yeah, with fw you can get more channels and lower latency for sure
[19:53:49] ralinux1 (~javi@64.Red-83-43-32.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net) left irc: Ping timeout: 248 seconds
[19:54:04] <eviljames> bandwidth is a problem if you want more channels (not a problem for basement/apartment use)
[19:54:13] <Urchlay> right
[19:55:18] <Nh3xus> ok. I'm not involved in a band so it's really apartment use for me
[19:56:07] <Urchlay> even if you're in a band, you can get by with low-end stuff to start with. Either record the whole band live (couple of mics in the room and/or mix output from the board), or lay down one track at a time.
[19:57:01] <Urchlay> or a combination... a band I play with, we recorded drums, bass, one guitar, keyboard live. Then the singer, lead guitar, and keyboard player added tracks to that.
[19:57:39] <Nh3xus> I see. So you make lossless records ?
[19:57:51] <eviljames> Indeed, all the demos my bands were making were using that tascam us100 and going track by track.  synth drums because I didn't have enough mics to do a full drum kit
[19:58:14] <eviljames> Nh3xus: just look into what ardour is and can do.
[19:58:35] <Urchlay> that's the idea... though I wasn't the one recording it (we know a guy with nice hardware + protools + more experience than I, got him to do it)
[19:58:36] <Nh3xus> I just googled your tascam us100 and it's actually quite cheap :)
[19:58:45] <Urchlay> beware the tascam us122
[19:59:07] <eviljames> Was it you that told me the 122 sucked, or someone else?  The drivers are apparently of questionable quality.
[19:59:36] <Urchlay> I've got one, it appears to work fine in linux... but every once in a while it just stops working in such a way that the jack server dies and the hardware has to be unplugged/replugged to get it going again
[19:59:40] <eviljames> Nh3xus: Yeah, imho it's great value for starting out.  I don't think it does MIDI though.. don't remember offhand.
[19:59:43] <eviljames> I gave it away :/
[19:59:54] <Nh3xus> eviljames: I'm on the Ardour website. It looks like the Ardour version 3 isn't released yet ?
[20:00:20] <eviljames> No, but when it is it'll be hot to trot
[20:00:26] <eviljames> It's in beta 6 now I think?
[20:00:39] <eviljames> beta 5 apparently.
[20:02:07] <Nh3xus> We will be in April, I will have time for trying that out
[20:02:17] <Nh3xus> When*

[20:08:51] <eviljames> It wasn't until they switched from metal to arena rock (Enter Sandman and onwards) that they sucked.
[20:09:14] <eviljames> In the 80s they were all about the tape trading scene.  Yes, that's how Metallica made it big - via the filesharing mechanism of its day.
[20:10:36] <eviljames> but looking at wikipedia of it, the other nominees were so stupid.  Iggy Pop, AC/DC, Jane's Addiction, Jethro Tull and Metallica.  ONE of those bands could be considered hard rock/heavy metal
[20:14:38] <Urchlay> ac/dc counts as "hard rock" in my book. Not metal though.

[20:45:55] <eviljames> $500,000 to take the Premier and her crew to London for the Olympics.  Something like 25 rooms reserved, and only 4 got used.

[21:29:42] <ananke> pim_: what's your source of authentication?
[21:30:23] <pim_> i suppose the passwd file
[21:30:45] <ananke> you're going to use system accounts? ouch
[21:30:58] <pim_> is that a problem?
[21:31:05] <wood_quinn> It's a little icky.
[21:31:20] <pim_> is it unsafe?
[21:31:22] <ananke> sure, because unless you want full blown users, you should be using virtual users
[21:31:37] <pim_> well the only actual user is going to be me
[21:31:48] <pim_> so i figured i'd just try it this way
[21:31:50] <ananke> then sure, go for it.
[21:31:52] <pim_> see if it would work
[21:32:16] Jeaye (~Jeaye@gateway/tor-sasl/jeaye) left irc: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
[21:32:18] <ananke> you don't need pam anyway for webmail. webmail would be contacting your imap service, and that would be doing the authentication
[21:33:20] <wood_quinn> Even if you have some web based gateway, I personally think there are better solutions than users on the machine.
[21:33:20] yf (~yenik@44.112.broadband3.iol.cz) joined ##slackware.
[21:33:21] <mmlj4> all you have to do to be reasonably safe is to set the users a non-executable shell
[21:34:20] <wood_quinn> PAM is great when you want to unify login credentials, but not so much when you're just trying to provide access to some service.
[21:34:36] <pim_> Well dovecot wasn't starting so I looked at the log Fatal: auth(default): Unknown passdb driver 'pam' (typo, or Dovecot was built without support for it? Check with dovecot --build-options)
[21:34:38] Jeaye (~Jeaye@gateway/tor-sasl/jeaye) joined ##slackware.
[21:34:47] <ananke> for a single user it's almost not worth doing any of these services
[21:34:57] <pim_> so I suppose the standard setting is to use pam

[21:37:23] <eviljames> pim_: Change the passdb driver to something else
[21:37:29] <wood_quinn> Isn't LDAP is something that's used quite often to provide unified logins?
[21:37:36] <eviljames> *shudder*
[21:37:40] <eviljames> There has to be a way to use NIS/YP
[21:37:52] <wood_quinn> No to LDAP? :)
[21:37:57] <wood_quinn> Good to know.
[21:38:08] yf (~yenik@44.112.broadband3.iol.cz) left irc: Quit: Konversation terminated!
[21:38:35] <mmlj4> eviljames: why NIS over ldap?
[21:39:56] <ananke> NIS, for when you want to feel like a hipster
[21:39:56] <eviljames> LDAP has traditionally been a PITA to configure and use day-to-day.
[21:40:17] TheM4ch1n3 (~shaun@41.48.16.46) joined ##slackware.
[21:40:23] <eviljames> Not to say that NIS is a whole lot better, but if you're in an all-unix-ish environment, it should work everywhere.
[21:40:45] <ananke> meh. openldap is not that hard, and there are plenty of good directory managers
[21:41:00] <ananke> granted, you do have to understand how LDAP works. NIS is much more primitive
[21:41:08] <mmlj4> wood_quinn: it depends on which IMAP server you choose... dovecot and vanilla imapd use system user accounts, while cyrus uses virtual ones
[21:41:26] <eviljames> ananke: Does it still qualify as lightweight?
[21:41:32] <mmlj4> ananke: aye, ldap has much learning curve
[21:41:38] <ananke> eviljames: very much so
[21:41:58] <mmlj4> lightweight as opposed to X.509
[21:41:59] <ananke> the amount of data stored and transported is very small
[21:42:11] <mmlj4> ...or whatever
[21:42:29] <mmlj4> the OSI monster is a beast, I'm told
[21:42:40] <ananke> but like i said, for a single user, it's not worth doing any of these

[21:48:55] Action: NightTiger went to a Waffle House in VA last month, and was reminded of a Winipeg Salsbury House environment. The phrase "greasy spoon" sprung to mind...

[21:52:36] <smed> she's a witch!
[21:52:39] <Urchlay> whoa, neat. Just found a vnc server that exports a linux framebuffer console
[21:52:53] <wood_quinn> Mmm.
[21:52:56] <wood_quinn> VNC.
[21:52:56] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: what !!, whats it called ?
[21:52:57] <smed> burn!
[21:53:24] <Urchlay> TheM4ch1n3: it's part of libvncserver, here: http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/
[21:53:25] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: also, you mean, /dev/fb0
[21:53:33] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: oh
[21:54:02] <TheM4ch1n3> I got that installed, v0.9.9
[21:54:04] <Urchlay> am doing a slackbuild of that, because it also has a SDL vnc viewer that supposedly will work on the framebuffer (no X)

[21:54:35] <Urchlay> have you got a slackbuild for it already?
[21:54:49] <TheM4ch1n3> ah, well I cannot think of a proper use for it
[21:54:51] <Urchlay> (don't see one on SBo)
[21:55:12] <Urchlay> for a vnc viewer that doesn't require X? install it on my netbook
[21:55:13] <TheM4ch1n3> isn't it part of v14 ?

[21:56:06] <TheM4ch1n3> yip
[21:56:07] <Urchlay> there are a bunch of demo/example binaries it builds that aren't in pat's package
[21:56:12] <Urchlay> wonder if any of them are any good
[21:56:20] <TheM4ch1n3> you know slackware oly chooses the best ;)

[21:56:33] Rat409 (~rat@bb-205-209-95-37.gwi.net) joined ##slackware.
[21:57:11] <Urchlay> well, the best at the time. Sometimes the definition of "the best" changes (e.g. svgalib used to be "the best" way to do graphics without X, but it's pretty well useless now)
[21:57:12] <TheM4ch1n3> SDLvncviewer.c maybe, dunno
[21:57:40] <TheM4ch1n3> yea, framebuffer is much more stable an output for that sort of activity
[21:58:16] <Urchlay> hm. Wonder how I managed to not have libvncserver installed on my netbook. It's on the desktop (I thought I needed to write a slackbuild until I looked there & saw it)
[21:58:27] <TheM4ch1n3> I notice there is a fb vnc server source file in an android dir
[21:58:55] <Urchlay> SDL apps don't need recompiling for fb use either. Appeals to me, sometimes I feel like running X, sometimes I don't
[21:59:06] <Urchlay> wish there was a halfway decent SDL web browser
[21:59:10] <TheM4ch1n3> maybe you are over-zealous with package selection
[21:59:12] <wood_quinn> Urchlay is bi-x-polar.
[21:59:35] <Urchlay> (or even a bad one, I can't find any at all except something called origyn, whose SVN server no longer works...)
[21:59:47] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: are you trying to squeeze away every wasted byte of X11 ?

[22:00:03] <TheM4ch1n3> wood_quinn: hahahaha
[22:00:15] <wizbit> there is a command called 'badblocks'
[22:00:17] <wizbit> interesting
[22:00:50] <Urchlay> mostly just trying to see what I can do with the framebuffer. The netbook actually runs X and even firefox just fine. But someday I might have something smaller (raspberry pi or such) where the overhead of X might be too much (or there might not be X for it, like my old sharp zaurus)
[22:01:47] <Urchlay> I'm forced (by kernel modesetting + Xorg's depending on it) to have a framebuffer rather than a plain-text console, so might as well see what good it is
[22:02:02] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Is that pronounced "Origuyn?"
[22:02:04] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[22:02:05] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: I think fine tuning /etc/X11/xorg.conf is a better method, or choosing a lightweight X11 server
[22:02:16] <Urchlay> (for many many years I disabled framebuffer and used plain VGA textmode for the console and was happy with it)
[22:02:33] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: no clue. The devs are apparently French...
[22:03:31] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: also doing all that work on X11, is a small nightmare, so using a framebuffer is allot less headache
[22:03:33] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: What version of it do you have?
[22:03:38] <Urchlay> TheM4ch1n3: lightweight X server? something like nano-x or the directFB X server?
[22:03:46] <TheM4ch1n3> yea
[22:04:06] <TheM4ch1n3> you could even strip away pieces of standard X (Xfree86)

[22:14:59] <eviljames> ARMedSlack doesn't work on RPi?
[22:15:21] <Urchlay> anyway nobody's done what I'm thinking of... basically a set of slackware packages you install over a regular slack install, that gives you a bunch of apps that work on framebuffer (some are recompiled versions of stuff that comes with slack, like maybe Qt built for the framebuffer instead of X)
[22:15:21] <TheM4ch1n3> eviljames: I think you must follow a howto, and struggle a little, but afaik it does
[22:16:18] <Urchlay> I found a PDF viewer for the framebuffer that actually works (its user interface is horrendous though, so I thought it didn't work at first)

[22:22:38] <TheM4ch1n3> maybe hes source makes sense as you read it ?

[22:23:07] <Urchlay> most of it does
[22:23:32] <TheM4ch1n3> well many people do this, and he may be a BSD kiddie
[22:23:47] <TheM4ch1n3> and that would explain the, read the source, attitude
[22:24:01] <Urchlay> but in e.g. fbvnc, he's got a bunch of hard-coded hex constants with no explanation of WTF they're for (they're raw VNC protocol key event numbers, beyond that I'm guessing)
[22:24:28] <wood_quinn> Hehe.
[22:24:57] <Urchlay> his fbvnc actually works for me... but redraws are painfully slow (maybe not his fault though), and the Alt key doesn't work (sorta kills its usefulness for me)
[22:24:59] <wood_quinn> Typical person who decides to host his code on public revision control for his own benefit.

[22:30:03] Action: TheM4ch1n3 was making a lame joke
[22:30:09] <Urchlay> though directfb is pretty complex, compared to apps that talk directly to the framebuffer
[22:30:26] <KaMii> directfb?  is that like the new facebook?
[22:30:27] <Urchlay> directfb has a display server (like X, but not X), and clients
[22:30:43] <KaMii> facebookOS
[22:30:47] <Urchlay> eww
[22:30:52] <KaMii> lol
