[00:59:53] <PeQuEnO_TuX> so u say to me download from slackbuild right?
[01:01:44] <thumbs> PeQuEnO_TuX: go to slackbuilds.org, and search for "aterm"
[01:01:52] <PeQuEnO_TuX> i did
[01:01:58] <thumbs> PeQuEnO_TuX: you can also use sbopkg to install it
[01:02:05] <PeQuEnO_TuX> they have the file tar.gz and .bz2
[01:02:41] <thumbs> you need to read about slackbuilds, and how they work
[01:02:54] <thumbs> it's probably simpler for you to use sbopkg instead
[01:03:20] <PeQuEnO_TuX> i have to install that sbopkg?
[01:03:23] <Crosma> You just download http://slackbuilds.org/slackbuilds/14.0/system/aterm.tar.gz, uncompress. Download http://downloads.sourceforge.net/aterm/aterm-1.0.0.tar.bz2 to the directory that the other file uncompressed. Then run the slackbuild.
[01:03:39] <Crosma> Then install the package that comes out.
[01:03:49] <thumbs> yes. It's a simple ncurses tool to install slackbuilds with a few keypresses

[01:40:00] <shonudo> and i've done that
[01:40:05] <peaceblaster> idt that's it though, because both Windows and Fedora still boot fine

[01:57:12] <peaceblaster> it locks up in seemingly random places
[01:57:13] <shonudo> hmmm
[01:57:32] <shonudo> full install usually just asks you to make one decision up front

[01:57:46] <shonudo> you have no more choices to make
[01:57:55] <peaceblaster> I said full install with KDE, and followed the installer's advice on all else
[01:57:55] <n1x4> Umm... my laptop does that.... I added 'pci=nommconf' and idle=poll to the kernel params and it works great.
[01:58:15] <peaceblaster> ok,will reinstall and do that
[01:58:36] <shonudo> okay, maybe it's just me (there are others here who may comment), but it sounds like you _didn't_ just do a full install

[02:05:08] <n1x4> just find out the socket and go from there
[02:05:21] <togermano> do i gotta unlock the dell bios?
[02:06:09] <n1x4> What do you mean unlock..Dell doesn't allow 'unlocking' for OC and what not.
[02:06:34] <peaceblaster> not sure if frozen or just taking forever
[02:06:49] <togermano> if i change the cpu dont i gotta change the clock and stuff
[02:06:56] <shonudo> wait a bit more, but it may be frozen
[02:07:07] <shonudo> if it is, it could be a ram problem, btw
[02:07:11] <n1x4> No, the cpu does that.. I would upgrade the bios to the latest/last version though.
[02:07:14] <shonudo> an install is a great test
[02:07:30] <togermano> thanks
[02:07:31] <n1x4> peaceblaster: that sounds exactly what happens to my alptop...
[02:07:37] <peaceblaster> ok, root partition set, and checked for bad block
[02:07:42] <shonudo> okay
[02:07:48] <shonudo> go to the next thing
[02:07:55] <shonudo> setup all other partitions

[02:08:30] <peaceblaster> so I'm assuming I should just mount home on sda4 (est. 130GB)?
[02:08:31] <shonudo> hey TommyC
[02:08:37] <TommyC> hey shonudo
[02:08:59] <shonudo> peaceblaster, all kidding aside, partitioning is the most subjective thing i can think of
[02:09:07] <shonudo> everyone sets up their boxes differently
[02:09:12] <shonudo> do whatever you like/want
[02:09:22] <peaceblaster> alrighty
[02:09:49] <peaceblaster> so I have /dev/sda1 as / ext4 defaults 1 1
[02:10:07] <peaceblaster> /dev/sda4 /home ext4 defaults 1 2

[02:11:58] <shonudo> the international support and bsd games are the two things you can omit

[02:13:46] <zenlunatic> slack installs in like 2 minutes on my sata 3 ssd
[02:14:06] <shonudo> that should take a while unless you're install on a ferrari like zenlunatic
[02:14:14] <peaceblaster> I use my only SSD for Windows, because that's the only way I cna stand it long enough to launch a game XD

[02:14:45] <zenlunatic> i mostly got my ssd for taking vm snapshots
[02:15:11] <n1x4> I need an ssd but I'm gonna wait until they drop in price a bit.
[02:15:29] <shonudo> yeah, the are a bit pricey still
[02:15:45] <n1x4>  a bit is an understatement.
[02:16:15] <shonudo> true, but only because storage has been dirt cheap for the past 3-5 years
[02:16:20] <zenlunatic> well i maxed out my ram and got an ssd and that will be it for about 3 years
[02:16:48] <n1x4> Indeed... I remember when 250mb hdd was 250$$... dollar a meg baby.
[02:16:53] <zenlunatic> then i will run it for another 3 on debian stable

[02:21:40] <peaceblaster> ok
[02:21:42] <shonudo> put it in the mbr
[02:21:58] <peaceblaster> um
[02:22:11] <peaceblaster> so "add a linux partition to the LILO config>"
[02:22:13] <peaceblaster> ?
[02:22:21] <shonudo> well, yeah
[02:22:26] <shonudo> add the /
[02:22:39] <shonudo> and name it
[02:22:40] <peaceblaster> ok, extra parameters to be passed
[02:22:41] <shonudo> after me
[02:22:42] <shonudo> lol
[02:22:44] <peaceblaster> ok XD
[02:22:47] <shonudo> lmao
[02:22:50] <peaceblaster> totally will
[02:22:50] <shonudo> DON'T!!
[02:22:52] <shonudo> lol
[02:22:53] <peaceblaster> ok
[02:23:11] <peaceblaster> any extra parameters?
[02:23:16] <shonudo> nope
[02:23:19] <peaceblaster> k
[02:23:21] <shonudo> shouldn't need to
[02:23:35] <peaceblaster> something about text consoles and UTF-8
[02:23:50] <peaceblaster> ends with "no is the safe option"
[02:24:00] <shonudo> skipping all of that is fine
[02:24:03] <peaceblaster> ok
[02:24:16] <shonudo> indeed, "no" is the _best_ option
[02:24:22] <peaceblaster> configure LILO to use frame buffer console?
[02:24:42] <shonudo> you really don't need that, but it doesn't hurt anything either
[02:24:45] <peaceblaster> ok
[02:24:58] <peaceblaster> now, important stuff
[02:25:11] <peaceblaster> install to root, floppy, or MBR?
[02:25:17] <shonudo> mbr
[02:25:23] <peaceblaster> MBR is "possibly unsafe", oh well XD
[02:25:23] <shonudo> imo
[02:25:35] <shonudo> yeah, it's also a good place to put it
[02:25:42] <peaceblaster> now, this should be the same as my root folder, yes?
[02:25:56] <peaceblaster> because if so, that was a problem
[02:25:58] <shonudo> what should be "the same as your root folder"?
[02:26:13] <shonudo> you're installing lilo to the mbr
[02:26:23] <peaceblaster> "confirm location to install LILO", selected MBR, now htis
[02:26:24] <shonudo> you're not doing anything else
[02:26:33] <peaceblaster> the default is /dev/sda
[02:26:37] <peaceblaster> ok

[02:35:55] <shonudo> lilo didn't install
[02:36:13] <peaceblaster> oh, lovely
[02:36:21] <peaceblaster> trying again =p
[02:36:32] <peaceblaster> I think I'll just use LILO's "simple"
[02:36:33] <shonudo> you can go back to the install disk, ID your partitions, and do lilo again
[02:36:38] <shonudo> no big
[02:36:38] <peaceblaster> k
[02:37:18] <oscurochu> im so frustrated right now, and im in desperate need for some quick help, my wireless card also took a crap earlier this week, and most of my homework is online and i just want to throw my computer across the room right now. =(

[02:56:59] <shonudo> i think i know where this is going
[02:57:03] <peaceblaster> I'll try that after this install

[02:57:24] <peaceblaster> ok
[02:57:44] <peaceblaster> it's halfway through isntalling though =p though no worries, shouldn;t take long

[02:58:49] <shonudo> because if you can't, that's the problem

[02:59:03] <peaceblaster> here's what happened when I last booted

[03:02:24] <peaceblaster> ok
[03:02:33] <thumbs> I'd disable acpi
[03:02:37] <BrokenCog> slackware dvd iso isn't a live disk.  only boot/install.
[03:03:15] <shonudo> you want a slack-like live cd
[03:03:29] <peaceblaster> ok, is it on the site?
[03:03:53] <thumbs> peaceblaster: slax is 100MB or so
[03:03:55] <BrokenCog> Slax maybe is close.
[03:04:11] <shonudo> slax would be the way to go, peaceblaster
[03:04:15] <BrokenCog> or, best, use the "create usb" option during Slackware install.
[03:04:34] <n1x4> I haven't tried it with the slack install iso but couldn't you just chroot?
[03:04:35] <BrokenCog> then you have a two-fer.  New install.  Second boot media.

[03:04:44] <n1x4> k
[03:04:45] <BrokenCog> well,

[03:14:30] <shonudo> easiest, fastest way to see if you can actually boot
[03:14:44] <peaceblaster> I think I have a 512MB flash drive somewhere that would be perfect for it
[03:16:04] <n1x4> BrokenCog: how goes the chroot'ing?
[03:16:25] <peaceblaster> also, will Slax preserve downloads and system setting between boots?

[03:25:02] <ananke> partitioning is silly. lvm solves half of those issues

[03:25:31] <shonudo> actually, that statement is part of the diversity, ananke
[03:25:33] <thumbs> shonudo: most would say /boot (for encrypted /), or just / and /home
[03:26:27] <n1x4> Not me, I prefer seperate partitons.... /var, /, /home and /tmp sometimes..
[03:26:32] <thumbs> if /var/log fills up, just rotate them, or use LVM
[03:27:15] <n1x4> Meh, I could I reckon it's just a matter of pref. for me really.

[03:45:21] <peaceblaster> thumbs: yeah, that's really the hard one
[03:45:26] <ananke> pi31415: quality
[03:45:27] <thumbs> peaceblaster: noacpi is a "safer" mode for your installation of slackware 14
[03:45:28] <pi31415> ananke, because the quality side was very debatable.  Linux was bad, but the commercial software was shockingly bad
[03:45:36] <n1x4> To hell with Arch and thier constant changing shit that doesn't need changing
[03:45:42] <shonudo> peaceblaster: it is the showstopper
[03:46:13] <peaceblaster> ok, cool. When I said slax doesn't recognize it, I meant out of the box, I haven't attempted to look for drivers or anything
[03:46:25] <pi31415> if Linux had ping of death it was fixed within hours
[03:46:34] <ananke> pi31415: dotcom bubble took place in what, late 2001, early 2002? linux was barely entering the realm of enterprise
[03:46:36] <peaceblaster> though it does see my ethernet port
[03:46:38] <pi31415> if something else had ping of death you stuck a firewall in front of it and waited for a month or two
[03:46:59] <pi31415> i thought dotcom bubble was late 90's and it started crashing around 2001/2002
[03:47:15] <ananke> pi31415: ping of death was applicable to OS running on workstations, not servers

[03:47:41] <pi31415> ananke, ping of death is a category of problems, not a specific problem.. you send bad network traffic and the system crashes
[03:47:42] <ananke> LVM2 wasn't even around back then
[03:47:50] <pi31415> this category of problem affected both workstations and servers
[03:48:09] <n1x4> Ahhh nuking
[03:48:28] <pi31415> wikipedia says i am wrong http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_of_death
[03:48:40] <ananke> In early implementations of TCP/IP, this bug was easy to exploit. This exploit has affected a wide variety of systems, including Unix, Linux, Mac, Windows, printers, and routers. However, most systems since 19971998 have been fixed, so this bug is mostly historical.[1]
[03:49:24] <ananke> overall, it's amazing how much the technology has progressed in the last 10-15 years
[03:49:26] <shonudo> peaceblaster, are you still here?
[03:49:29] <shonudo> how's it going?
[03:49:52] <thumbs> peaceblaster: did you add noapci to lilo.conf?
[03:50:03] <ananke> linux is a viable option. virtualization is everywhere. high availability is possible on commodity hardware
[03:50:09] <pi31415> ananke, Linux fixed that kind of problem more quickly than the competition
[03:50:25] <ananke> pi31415: it also introduced problems at a much faster rate
[03:50:39] <peaceblaster>  shonudo: yeah, still here. REinstalling Slackware now
[03:50:41] <pi31415> ananke, the GNU userland was hardened against garbage input long before the competition too
[03:51:00] <shonudo> hmmmmm, a reinstall
[03:51:06] <shonudo> not sure that was necessary, but okay
[03:51:09] <n1x4> peaceblaster: Well, bright side is you should be pretty good with the install process by now ;)
[03:51:14] <shonudo> lol
[03:51:22] <djzn> what do you guys think...
[03:51:23] <BrokenCog> ping of death was originally a specific workstation bug, which became a class of problems related to singleton data container bugs.
[03:51:24] <n1x4> Should have just mounted it within slax
[03:51:26] <djzn> CentOS
[03:51:28] <djzn> good?
[03:51:29] <ananke> pi31415: meh. security is not the only criteria i use to evaluate a product
[03:51:31] <peaceblaster> yeah, I can just fly through it now
[03:51:53] <pi31415> ananke, the things i have mentioned are as much related to stability as security
[03:52:27] <ananke> pi31415: like i said, the flip side is how fast bugs were being introduced, ones that affected stability
[03:52:33] <peaceblaster> Just when I thought I was finally getting good with Linux, I show up here and feel like the noobest of noobs lol
[03:52:53] <thumbs> peaceblaster: no, kernel incompatibilities can be a pain
[03:53:28] <thumbs> peaceblaster: take, for instance, older days where I've seen ubuntu discs boot fine on some hardware, and slackware / centos discs just fail
[03:53:31] <n1x4> thumbs: Ain't that the truth!
[03:53:34] <peaceblaster> it's not just my installation issues, just the level of conversation about OS comparison and history is totally over my head
[03:53:48] <pi31415> ananke, i will take your word for it because I only have anecdotes on that front
[03:54:04] <thumbs> peaceblaster: well, it comes with the folks that idle here, mostly.
[03:54:11] <peaceblaster> honestly, this and Arch Linux are the only OSs I've ever had kernel issues with
[03:54:19] <thumbs> peaceblaster: you'll have a very wide knowlegebase
[03:55:07] <pi31415> I have this warm fuzzy feeling that ext4 is less likely to lose my data than ext2 was

[03:55:22] <thumbs> ext2?
[03:55:24] <peaceblaster>  thumbs: really I've only been using Linux consistently for about a year, and was hoping to learn a lot more by getting into a more advanced OS like Slackware. (both my machines run Fedora atm). Also, I plan to go into computer science in colelge so that should help too

[03:56:05] <peaceblaster> no idea lol
[03:56:14] <thumbs> pi31415: I know. Why would one even consider it?
[03:56:29] <pi31415> thumbs, because ext3 and ext4 weren't made yet
[03:56:33] <peaceblaster> well, it involves more than hitting "install", then finding rpms through google
[03:56:38] <peaceblaster> lol
[03:56:41] <shonudo> heh
[03:56:45] <ananke> pi31415: i've had every filesystem lose data at some point. and i've had plenty of hardware solutions lose data :)
[03:56:46] <n1x4> Ummm
[03:56:56] <shonudo> okay, that may (or may not) be "more advanced"
[03:57:00] <thumbs> peaceblaster: it means that your kernel won't depends as much on the BIOS.
[03:57:09] Action: ananke remembers when reiserfs was a decent option, because it was the first and only journaled fs available on linux
[03:57:10] <thumbs> peaceblaster: which means less chances of locking up.
[03:57:16] <Skaperen> marketing people should not be allowed to use certain words like "advanced"
[03:57:19] <thumbs> ananke: it's still decent.
[03:57:23] <peaceblaster> alright, good. My BIOS is some ASUS UEFI madness
[03:57:24] <pi31415> ananke: the way you hold the flashlight under your face when you say that... gives me the spooks!
[03:57:31] <thumbs> EFI :)
[03:57:39] <peaceblaster> like, it has a cursor and GUI
[03:57:41] <peaceblaster> so weird
[03:58:08] <pi31415> Skaperen: it reminds me of when there was a Microsoft product with the word Advanced in it
[03:58:09] <ananke> thumbs: i just wouldn't deploy it on a new system
[03:58:26] <thumbs> ananke: I still trust it for all my laptops and workstations
[03:58:32] <ananke> pi31415: our biggest data loss almost cost us a $40mil contract
[03:58:36] <pi31415> Skaperen: some joker said the other editions were larval
[03:58:46] <Skaperen> pi31415: it's like they knew people would know it wasn't advanced
[03:58:55] <peaceblaster> Already I'm learning just being on here. The Fedora and Ubuntu channels are just people being clueless about graphics drivers
[03:59:07] <thumbs> peaceblaster: EFI is a very new BIOS.
[03:59:25] <ananke> thumbs: certainly, where we have it, it's decent. my biggest concern about deploying it on new systems is how long it will be supported
[03:59:29] Action: Skaperen remembers working on a computer that had no BIOS (or PROM)
[03:59:32] <pi31415> in the alternative computer history, OFW became mainstream
[03:59:35] <thumbs> peaceblaster: a newer BIOS, combined with a not-so-bleeding edge kernel, means possible lockups
[03:59:42] <djzn> we needed a distro that is kinda a hibrid like slackware and archlinux
[03:59:46] <peaceblaster>  thumbs: I've noticed, and it made getting Arch Linux working a serious pain
[03:59:54] <thumbs> ananke: and it's a pain to undelete.
[03:59:55] <djzn> that would be both of the BEST of the BEST worlds out there
[04:00:12] <thumbs> peaceblaster: so you have to tune your booting kernel into "safe" mode
[04:00:20] <peaceblaster> djzn: Someone early today suggested installing arch and using Slack's security updates
[04:00:22] Action: n1x4 wishes he could ignore keywords.. :/
[04:00:24] <pi31415> not that OFW is superior to EFI, but it is arguably more open
[04:00:32] <ananke> thumbs: that's something we don't expect from any normal filesystem :)
[04:01:01] <thumbs> ananke: speaking from someone that undeleted files, sector by sector on ext3, for 30 hours in a row
[04:01:11] <ananke> it's funny, just yesterday we had a two hour conference call with one of the NASA centers on how they deal with their DMF storage and prevent data loss
[04:01:33] <djzn> peaceblaster: well... archlinux got bad when they removed the slackware like installer
[04:02:12] <peaceblaster>  thumbs: I've gotten to the LILO installation part. Where exactly should I put this in? I didn't see a specific option for it
[04:02:33] <n1x4> djzn: arch linux got bad when they started using systemd
[04:02:43] <thumbs> install lilo, and edit lilo.conf after.
[04:02:46] <peaceblaster> djzn: I honestly know little about Arch Linux, but I've heard pacman is supposed to be amazing
[04:02:54] <peaceblaster> ok, simple enough
[04:02:55] <ananke> thumbs: ouch. my longest recovery stint was about 16 hours, but it was mostly manning the restore via tsm client. i was lucky enough not to participate in the attempts to restore our databases, when the storage solution decided to flip bits at random
[04:03:12] <djzn> n1x4: what about systemd.... dont you like it

[04:06:44] <djzn> you cant find anything in the middle of it

[04:07:04] <Crosma> upstart on Ubuntu keeps getting confused about whether something is running or not.
[04:07:34] <Crosma> It won't let you start something if it thinks it's already started.
[04:07:53] <Crosma> So it won't let you restart something if it thinks it's already started, because it can't stop it.
[04:07:54] <thumbs> Crosma: and this is ##slackware
[04:07:56] <djzn> n1x4: well i dont think so... systemd is much faster...thatz why distros are moving to it
[04:07:58] <n1x4> */j ubuntu ??
[04:08:09] <peaceblaster> hmmm..... the only options it gives me are boot slackware, and press <tab> for a LILO prompt
[04:08:20] <peaceblaster> which then returns no such image when I try anything
[04:08:21] <Crosma> I know. I'm just giving yet another reason why Ubuntu is terrible.
[04:08:34] <peaceblaster> will I need to mount it in SLax or something?
[04:08:35] <n1x4> peaceblaster: should have addd those params when installing lilo
[04:08:46] <thumbs> peaceblaster: you need to boot the installation disk, chroot to the / partition, edit /etc/lilo.conf, and run lilo -v
[04:08:54] <peaceblaster> oh, ok
[04:08:56] <djzn> why lilo is still default on slackware?
[04:09:05] <thumbs> djzn: lilo is flexible.
[04:09:20] <peaceblaster> this is the first time I've used lilo

[04:14:16] <BrokenCog> will SSD work with ext4?
[04:14:23] <BrokenCog> as a boot disk I mean.
[04:14:37] <peaceblaster>  thumbs: said something about sbin being inacessable
[04:14:50] <thumbs> peaceblaster: you booted the installation media?
[04:15:00] <peaceblaster> yes
[04:15:16] <thumbs> what did you try to mount, exactly?
[04:15:20] <BrokenCog> installed twice and get a kernel panic on restart.  complains no recognizable FS of any type ( reiser, ext, someothers ).  but it wast just intsalled wtih ext4 ...
[04:15:21] <peaceblaster> prior to running 'setup', you have a shell as root
[04:15:36] <thumbs> you HAVE to mount the / partition to /mnt/otherplace
[04:15:44] <thumbs> then chrootdir /mnt/otherplace
[04:16:07] <thumbs> nothing more than that
[04:17:01] <pi31415> one surprising use of systemd, for me, was offline updates
[04:17:01] <peaceblaster> ok, sorry, not familiar with mount and chroot
[04:17:04] <pi31415> http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/OfflineSystemUpdates#Detailed_Description
[04:17:33] <pi31415> Replacing libraries and files while the OS is running can cause problems ranging from application crashes to inconsistent system states where processes are using different versions of a library at the same time. By installing system updates 'outside' the normal system operation, we avoid these problems.
[04:17:57] <pi31415> it's like a Windows style "reboot to apply this userland update"
[04:18:23] <peaceblaster> ok, got in
[04:18:40] <peaceblaster> where is lilo.conf?

[04:21:09] <peaceblaster> still having mounting issues then, I guess
[04:21:11] <thumbs> you have to pay attention to details.
[04:21:24] <thumbs> you can't mount /dev/sda1?
[04:21:35] <thumbs> is that where your / partition lives/
[04:22:25] <peaceblaster> yes, it is. What is the precise command to mount it from here? I tried mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
[04:22:30] <peaceblaster> did nothing
[04:23:03] <thumbs> NO don't use /mnt
[04:23:15] <thumbs> use /mnt/anotherpathhere
[04:23:28] <peaceblaster> k
[04:23:33] <peaceblaster> so it'd be like
[04:23:36] <n1x4> mkdir first ;)
[04:23:36] <peaceblaster> mkdir hi
[04:23:47] <peaceblaster> mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/hi
[04:23:48] <peaceblaster> ?
[04:28:18] <BrokenCog> yes.
[04:28:21] <BrokenCog> exactly.

[04:31:28] <thumbs> zenlunatic: what's the issue?

[04:32:51] <peaceblaster> Yes, but it freezes during boot after several reinstalls, and thumbs suggested I "append= acpi=off" in lilo.conf
[04:33:07] <djzn> peaceblaster: just mount your root partition and chroot to it and edit lilo.conf and run lilo
[04:33:45] <zenlunatic> i installed flsynclient and the kde touchpad and they also don't recognize
[04:33:50] <peaceblaster> ok, in lilo.conf

[05:27:54] <KaMii> that way, I dont have to reboot due to a hdd issue, unless that hdd issue is /
[05:28:14] <KaMii> well, swap and /boot are also on the / drive
[05:32:58] <KaMii> hrm, they dont show the hotswap by I have, mine has a fan and temp sensor built in, with a lcd readout of the fan speed and temperature, and buttons I can use to change the fan speed... and it still only cost me like $25
[05:33:34] <peaceblaster> nice
[05:33:57] <KaMii> I always suggest putting non OS hdd's in hotswap bays
[05:34:23] <KaMii> makes it sooo easy to change a hdd, and you have no system downtime
[05:34:38] <peaceblaster> True, though I kind of have 3 OS hdd's XD little bit of an addiction

[05:41:17] <KaMii> OSX is the easiest host to get a vb to work on
[05:41:52] <Urchlay> copland: IRC doesn't have rooms, it has channels... and this is a pretty good channel to ask for bash help
[05:43:18] <KaMii> i would think #bash probably exists

I have a script that preforms a number of related tasks on a remote server.  so I have my if statment that if $1=scope it runs a series of commands now what I trying to do is modify that so after it runs the last command it sleeps 300;  then does ps -ef if the process that I just restarted is still running high say +60% cpu load that it starts back at step one which is restart the s

[05:50:52] <KaMii> is there some xfce service I need running=

[05:59:45] <KaMii> pray to your maker?
[05:59:57] <copland> before you get on me about the php commands not my idea
[05:59:59] <Urchlay> so after 'sleep 300' you need another 'ssh -qt server.domain.com' that executes a command on the remote side, which spits out the cpu% being used by the process?
[06:00:15] <copland> yeah that part i have down
[06:00:30] <Urchlay> ok, assume that part is called foobar
[06:00:31] <copland> I can simply grep that out of ps
[06:00:48] <Urchlay> USAGE=$( ssh -qt server.domain.com foobar )

[06:01:16] <Urchlay> (have the remote side just spit out a number without a % sign, makes it easier)

[06:01:55] <Urchlay> perhaps do in in a while loop?
[06:02:07] <Urchlay> while [ "$done" = "no" ]; do
[06:02:38] <copland> ok that make sense with while.  It been ages since I had to script anything
[06:02:48] <Urchlay> initialize with done=no before the loop. And in the body of the loop, done=yes if everything's OK
[06:03:48] <mad_enz> or while [ 1 ]; do if .... else break; done
[06:04:13] <Urchlay> yeah, that avoids the need for a variable. Though I'd write as 'while true; do'
[06:04:43] <copland> See this is why i love linux also a millsions of ways to doing the same thing there is almost no wrong way to proceed lol

[06:07:50] <KaMii> Urchlay: can you use gpg to encrypt / decrypt folders on the fly?  like... /home
[06:08:04] <KaMii> if so... i think my project can work and I wont need pam
[06:08:26] <Strum> there are too many ways to do the same thing with linux
[06:08:28] <KaMii> i would just need root to create a gpg key during install
[06:08:32] <Strum> that's one of it's failings

[06:09:22] <Strum> no standardisation

[06:09:52] FLYSWATER (devise@2001:41d0:2:6e34::1) joined ##slackware.
[06:09:54] <mad_enz> u can encrypt files within a directory or tar it
[06:09:56] <Strum> too many ego driven developers who insist there way is the only way
[06:09:57] <pink_mist> but yeah, gpg probably won't do what you want there KaMii :>
[06:09:59] <mad_enz> not sure what you mean on the fly tho
[06:09:59] <KaMii> mad_enz: well i was afraid of that, is there anything gpg like that does?  and dont mention truecrypt, thats not an option I want to use
[06:10:06] <Urchlay> Strum: ehhh. That's not a failing. If you want "overall vision" you can stick with one of the commercial-ish distros, like RHEL
[06:10:29] <mad_enz> or Windows
[06:10:44] <mad_enz> no wait...Mac
[06:11:01] <mad_enz> KaMii: why not truecrypt?
[06:11:32] <pink_mist> KaMii: honestly, I would definitely use truecrypt for that :>
[06:12:07] <mad_enz> or luks
[06:12:15] <KaMii> because truecrypt is not open source
[06:12:22] <mad_enz> what about luks?
[06:12:34] <KaMii> luks wont work for what I want
[06:12:36] <Strum> exactly the response one would epxect from linux fanboys
[06:12:41] <KaMii> i really want a container
[06:12:57] <KaMii> so each user has its own locked container that gets unlocked when they login
[06:13:07] <KaMii> unlocked then mounted
[06:13:09] <pink_mist> Strum: are you actually trying to argue some point or other? why?
[06:13:32] <Strum> argue no
[06:13:35] <Strum> make point yes
[06:13:51] <KaMii> so even root cannot acces their ~/
[06:14:23] <KaMii> pink_mist: ok i got a new problem with this keyboard layout.. thats annoying for me to type a ~ I have to altgr ~ +2  do you have the same issue?
[06:14:38] <pink_mist> Strum: what exactly was your point again? because if it was that 'different viewpoints are detrimental', I have yet to see any evidence of that. that's just subjective.
[06:14:50] <pink_mist> KaMii: yeah >_> I do hate that
[06:15:08] <KaMii> pink_mist: ok yea, thats why I was using the (eliminate dead keys)
[06:15:15] <KaMii> but then i lost the  option
[06:15:15] <mad_enz> KaMii: mmm...how many users do you have to maintain?
[06:15:27] <KaMii> mad_enz: thats not important
[06:15:30] <pink_mist> KaMii: but altgr+~+~ should work..
[06:15:38] <Strum> there is far too much duplication of functionality and therfore coding effort
[06:15:44] <KaMii> pink_mist: yea, thas what I have to do, and its really annoying
[06:15:46] <Strum> mostly due to the egos of developers
[06:15:49] <pink_mist> right, yeah
[06:16:22] <copland> If it were not for the egos of developers we would not have half of what we had today
[06:16:29] <KaMii> so gpg only works to encrypt a single file....
[06:16:32] <mad_enz> it sortof is...if it is a small group, u could create individual mounts for each user and thus achieve ur container requirement
[06:16:43] <pink_mist> KaMii: maybe you could edit the keymaps and have one that works specially for the ~ key (but then you won't be able to write things like maana :<)
[06:17:01] <KaMii> oh... thats probably why it acts like that then
[06:17:21] <pink_mist> or jalapeo
[06:17:27] <pink_mist> now I'm getting hungry :P
[06:17:31] <KaMii> ok, well if I ever learn spanish or portugese I will use that option
[06:17:32] <mad_enz> if it is a large group, then that gets inefficient very quickly
[06:17:49] <KaMii> mad_enz: im not going for efficiency
[06:17:59] <KaMii> im going for ultra paranoid security
[06:18:37] <copland> Then I would suggest  not letting them use computers at all.
[06:18:56] <KaMii> also its nice beacuse what I want is when a user logs out, it will automatically dismount that users ~/ container making it secure
[06:19:03] <mad_enz> then with LVM+luks, u could create individual partition for each user...u will create a login script to mount the user ~/ using encryption keys
[06:19:06] <pink_mist> Strum: duplication of effort doesn't happen *that* often .. most opensource people take a look at what exists already and make use of that if it's available ... this actually helps reduce duplication of effort ... it's the non-opensource world that often tend to have a problem with NIH and duplication of effort from my experience

[06:19:24] <Strum> security = (time*money)/paranoia
[06:19:50] <KaMii> mad_enz: but i dont like that option because everything has to be fixed and in place when you fdisk,  not allowing you to add more userspace or user accounts in the future
[06:20:09] <KaMii> plus encrypted containers is just so much easier to administer
[06:20:09] <Skywise> the whole idea of capitolism is having many people waste time and effort to produce essentially the same thing only with superficial differences and call it competition
[06:20:17] <Strum> so that's why we have KDE and gnome is it?
[06:20:37] <mad_enz> not entirely sure how u would prevent root from accessing ~/ since u will need to setup and unlock scheme in ur script
[06:20:44] <Skywise> we still have gnome?
[06:20:51] <pink_mist> Strum: no gnome in slackware
[06:20:53] <KaMii> mad_enz: i will use pam
[06:20:53] <Strum> and i diddn't say that closed source projects were immune from these problems either
[06:21:04] <pink_mist> Strum: then I don't understand what your point was
[06:21:07] <pink_mist> could you reiterate?
[06:21:20] <mad_enz> actually that's where LVM comes in...u can resize ur LV and add new LV as users require
[06:21:27] <Strum> it's not worth it
[06:21:33] <pink_mist> because it looked to me like that was one of the differences you specifically pointed out
[06:21:38] <Urchlay> Strum: so, what then? there should be only one official government-sanctioned body for the entire world, who dictates to everyone on the planet exactly what software may and may not be developed?
[06:21:52] <mad_enz> i've never used pam so i have no suggestion there
[06:21:58] <KaMii> mad_enz: i know but... i dont like messing with lvm and resizing things... when a contaier is just so much easier to setup
[06:22:06] <pink_mist> except of course, it's not a difference
[06:22:15] <Strum> reductio ad absurdum Urchlay, logical falacy
[06:22:21] <Strum> fallacy
[06:22:58] <Urchlay> it wasn't meant as a serious argument, it was more of a rhetorical question, designed to provoke you into answering with whatever your actual idea was
[06:23:00] <copland> Kamii  security is funny for me it doing my best by removing idiots from the equation as much as possible to that end I really like xendesktop where each user does have a encrypted session and directories on close
[06:23:04] <KaMii> unless there is a tool that makes resizing lvm's very simple
[06:23:08] <Urchlay> (so far you haven't expressed it to us)
[06:23:33] <Strum> ad hominem
[06:23:37] <copland> So strum you all want us using one distro with on window manager
[06:23:37] <Urchlay> you know what?
[06:23:53] <Strum> actually i reckong that would be good
[06:23:55] <Urchlay> when we're on TV, in a formal debate, you can use your latin terminology
[06:23:57] <Strum> one gui toolkit
[06:24:01] <Strum> one window manager
[06:24:05] <Urchlay> this is an informal discussion
[06:24:14] <Urchlay> ok, that's your idea
[06:24:30] <KaMii> copland: i dont want virtualization for this project
[06:24:31] <Urchlay> I think nobody who actually develops software for linux is going to agree with you
[06:24:33] <KaMii> thats not a goal
[06:24:50] <pink_mist> <Strum> ad hominem <-- wait, what? when did anyone attack your character? stop that. that's provably false.
[06:24:55] <copland> Strom with out egos there would be no debian  which means no ubuntu which means fewer people would try linux.
[06:25:20] <KaMii> copland: i can live with that
[06:25:28] <mad_enz> KaMii: working with LVM is not so difficult if once u get accustom to it
[06:25:29] <copland> Developers are people.  People have egos  it is a way of life.
[06:25:32] <Urchlay> anyway, I'm not going to debate with a guy who's made a study of the science of debating. I will lose, even if the other guy is wrong.
[06:26:00] <Strum> more ad hominem
[06:26:13] <KaMii> mad_enz: and thats the thing, I want a very nice user(idiot) friendly setup
[06:26:18] <Urchlay> not really. I wasn't insulting your character.
[06:26:23] <pink_mist> Strum: that wasn't an attack either. stop that.
[06:26:29] <KaMii> using lvm will not work for my project
[06:26:35] <mad_enz> KaMii: u could even add the lv creation to ur useradd script
[06:26:40] <KaMii> unless there is a very idiot friendly tool to use
[06:26:58] <mad_enz> KaMii: then again, u want an easy to use container so pan might b ur best bet
[06:27:21] <copland> Kamii dont get me wrong I hate debian and ubuntu but I dont hate the fact that people who would of never made it pass the slackware installer to linux to learn I will give them A for that.
[06:27:23] <Urchlay> anyway, can we just talk like people, without invoking robert's rules of order or plato's debating stuff from classical philosophy?
[06:27:25] <KaMii> yea... i really dont want to have to resort to pam... but if i have to... i will
[06:27:30] <Strum> windows suxks, mac sucks more , linux suck too it might be the least worst
[06:27:40] <Urchlay> (actually, no we can't, because I'm going to go do something else for a while anyway)
[06:28:01] <KaMii> so that means plan 9 is the best?
[06:28:06] <Strum> egos and greed don't make for good software
[06:28:09] <Strum> in the end
[06:28:12] <Skywise> with linux if you don't like it, you can fix it
[06:28:12] <KaMii> awww, Urchlay dont go
[06:28:22] <Strum> if you have several life times
[06:28:25] <copland> kamii no i think he believes cp/m is the best.
[06:28:45] <Skywise> and with linux chances are someone already has fixed it and explained how they did it
[06:29:00] <Strum> for a given value of "fixed"
[06:29:05] <mad_enz> KaMii: security (especially encryption) and idiot friendly is an oxymoron
[06:29:23] <KaMii> mad_enz: i disagree with that statement
[06:29:29] <KaMii> i can be made friendly
[06:29:36] <pink_mist> lol
[06:29:42] <KaMii> the developer just has to make the effort
[06:29:55] <copland> mad_enz: yes just like using the words smart and enduser in the same sentence.
[06:30:26] <mad_enz> and how far should a developer go
[06:30:37] <KaMii> my goal is to make linux user friendly, not user stupid.. i belive ubuntu went the user stupid direction
[06:31:07] <pink_mist> I really do believe that security is the most important field to get idiot-proof
[06:31:15] <pink_mist> it's a shame we're not there yet
[06:31:19] <Strum> perfect security is impossible
[06:31:28] <KaMii> who said the word perfect?
[06:31:30] <pink_mist> that's not what anyone said
[06:31:30] <Strum> no system can be fully secured
[06:31:43] <mad_enz> i've tried to setting up complex password policy in my environment and I am always amaze what end users will do to avoid complex passwords
[06:31:47] <Strum> it's a matter of the time and expense you want to put into be secure
[06:31:49] <Skywise> security is a cat and mouse game
[06:31:53] <Strum> the imprtance of the data
[06:31:55] <Skywise> its always changing
[06:32:00] <KaMii> well with that attitude, then why dont you jsut put your boxen outside the DMZ with no iptables
[06:32:14] <KaMii> and no root password
[06:32:37] <pink_mist> because he uses windows probably :P
[06:32:44] <KaMii> i think someone came in here just to argue for the sake of arguing
[06:32:56] <pink_mist> Strum: *that* was an ad hominem.
[06:33:02] <pink_mist> Strum: learn to recognize them.
[06:33:06] <KaMii> pink_mist: then he is already in the dmz with no iptables and administrator is insecure
[06:33:14] <Strum> security = paranoia/(time*money)
[06:33:27] <KaMii> Strum: than dont use it
[06:33:33] <KaMii> i really dont care

[06:42:12] <pink_mist> hmm, what's not opensource with it then I wonder
[06:42:27] <KaMii> could be some government backdoor?
[06:42:32] <KaMii> idk, conspiracys, lol
[06:42:58] <KaMii> probably some proprietary code they dont want released for some reason, but the question is, what is that reason?

[06:43:46] <Strum> i think that is the attitude i am trying to get across
[06:43:46] <mad_enz> KaMii: dm-crypt is LUKS
[06:45:47] <KaMii> well it says it can work as a container
[06:45:48] <Skywise> saturday night and i just ate a pint of choc chip cookie dough ice cream
[06:46:00] <KaMii> must mean it uses luks to create that container
[06:46:08] <Skywise> i need to calm down

[06:46:59] <KaMii> don't eat grandma's brownies
[06:47:13] <Skywise> she needs to get her own
[06:47:20] <KaMii> unless you live in a place that doesnt have medical marijuana
[06:47:50] <Skywise> not yet
[06:48:02] <Skywise> i'm not a big fan of eating pot anyway
[06:48:56] <Skywise> smoking it can't be great for you either, but its not very tasty as an ingredient
[06:49:18] <KaMii> maybe thats why they put it in a brownie?
[06:49:32] <Strum> mask it with sugar and chocolate
[06:49:42] <Skywise> yeah, i don't think it works
[06:49:47] <Strum> you have to dry it and powder it up

[06:51:13] <KaMii> im not talking about getting high off it, im talking about for medical use

[06:51:27] <Skywise> honey, they're the same
[06:51:29] <mad_enz> KaMii: i could be wrong, but dm-crypt (LUKS) support of container is through using loop devices
[06:52:04] <Skywise> the high is the medicinal quality
[06:52:17] <mad_enz> u'll still need to mount/umount these loop devices...not much different that using lvm

[06:53:30] <Strum> it has a long history of being eaten
[06:53:37] <KaMii> mad_enz: thats why i need pam so when you login it will decrypt and mount your container
[06:53:46] <Strum> i like it but you need a lot
[06:53:53] <Skywise> i'd say its one of its strong points
[06:54:06] <Skywise> yes, i'm gonna have to draw the line at 2 pints tho
[06:54:15] <Strum> overuse is not good for your digestion
[06:54:16] <Skywise> thats getting out of hand
[06:54:25] <KaMii> i would puke if I ate just one pint
[06:54:37] <Skywise> its not that hard
[06:54:42] <KaMii> it is for me
[06:54:59] <mad_enz> KaMii: fair enough...sounds like u are set on pam?

[06:56:00] TheM4ch1n3 (~shaun@41.48.16.52) joined ##slackware.
[06:56:12] <Skywise> ah ha, you gotta use pam
[06:56:14] <mad_enz> KaMii: exactly how will ur simplified secure system work?
[06:56:23] <KaMii> if the user login is going to handle decryting, mounting and dismounting, then I thinjk I have to use pam
[06:56:29] <Skywise> with pam, it ain't exacty simplified anymore
[06:56:30] <mad_enz> I'm very interested in ur setup as I could use it one day
[06:57:13] <mad_enz> more of my users and computer illiterate and see no issue using PASSWORD as a password
[06:57:28] <mad_enz> ***most**
[06:59:33] <KaMii> well my idea is, and its just a learning project for me, thats all.  just something fun to do.  is use slackware as base...  then when you 'adduser' it will create an encrypted container for that user.  then when the user logs in, it will mount that container to /home/ the container will have one folder in it 'username' the reason for this is so people cannot do a ls /home to see usernames)
[06:59:53] TommyC (~TommyC@unaffiliated/sepulchralbloom) left irc: Quit: TTFN, Ta Ta For Now!
[07:00:01] <KaMii> and when the user logs out, it will dismount that container
[07:01:15] <KaMii> thisway, if you are super paraniod and want to make sure your ~/ is encrypted when you are not using the computer all you have to do is logout, instead of turning off the system
[07:01:22] <mad_enz> i use slackware as base and already have that setup with both full disk encryption and as separate encrypted volumes under /home
[07:01:46] <mad_enz> firstly, /home has permission 711 so users cannot do ls /home
[07:02:11] <pink_mist> KaMii: what if the user puts something in cron? should that 'activate' the container?
[07:02:13] <mad_enz> that will prevent users from view the rest of users on the system...not encryption required there
[07:02:28] <KaMii> mad_enz: right, but if you have multiple users then you still would have to dismount /home to encrypt all your files, meaning no other user can be online and logged in
[07:03:05] <mad_enz> that user $HOME is mounted under /home/<user>
[07:03:16] <KaMii> pink_mist: i thought about that, and i figure if they are not logged in then that cron will not activate,  they need to be logged in for the userdefined cronjobs to work
[07:03:42] <pink_mist> that's not how cron works, no :>
[07:04:02] <KaMii> i know, but its for ultra high paranoid secruity
[07:04:13] <KaMii> meaning, some options just will not be available
[07:04:15] <pink_mist> in that case, disable cron :P
[07:04:20] <KaMii> pretty much
[07:04:28] <KaMii> users cannot cron only root can
[07:04:40] <Skywise> you compromise the system when you let users on it
[07:04:48] <mad_enz> for each user i create lv-<user>. when the user logs in, this is mounted under /home/<user>...when the user logs out, the /home/<user> is unmounted and the container closed
[07:05:08] <KaMii> mad_enz: do you have a script that does this?
[07:05:43] <KaMii> how does the /home/user get exactly?
[07:05:52] <KaMii> because thats what im trying to figure out

[07:10:32] <wood_quinn> As to the ongoing discussion, I wish there were a good way to encrypt home directories.
[07:10:37] <Strum> talk about pwnage

[07:11:22] <Urchlay> KaMii: "can't ls /home to see usernames"... I hate to break it to you, but usernames are already listed in /etc/passwd for everyone to see. Changing that would be a good bit of work, too.
[07:11:35] <KaMii> wood_quinn: thats what im trying to figure out, a very easy user friendly way to set it all up and maintain it
[07:11:57] <KaMii> Urchlay: oh.. thats true
[07:11:59] <mad_enz> no, i don't have a script...I was simply extending what I have setup to meet ur requirements
[07:12:23] <KaMii> mad_enz: how did you get it all setup?  can you maybe pastbin your steps?
[07:12:36] <KaMii> im wondering how you get the login process to mount and dismount ?
[07:12:55] <mad_enz> my setup is all manual and the decryption of the user $HOME is done @ boot
[07:12:56] <Urchlay> Strum: is that the "why linux sucks" video?
[07:13:07] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: You could set root's umask to 022. Lol. I'm pretty sure the last time I tried that it screwed my system though.
[07:13:09] <Strum> yeah
[07:13:23] <wood_quinn> *077
[07:13:54] <KaMii> mad_enz: yea.. i have that alraedy, and I dont like that option, as the user's $HOME is decrypted and mounted at boot, i want it only decrypted and mounted when they login, then dismounted when they logout
[07:14:05] <Urchlay> yeah, I'm too busy using my sucky linux system to listen to someone explain why it sucks

[07:18:16] <KaMii> the guy doing the presentation is just a whiny little bitch thats jealous because he cant create his own OS... and all he does is complain about the Ubuntu Gui color scheme
[07:18:56] <Necrosporus> Color scheme is easy to change
[07:19:34] <Necrosporus> There are other much more valid reasons to criticize Ubuntu: it's amazon integration
[07:19:41] <KaMii> you know what sucks, is his presentation, becasue at around minute 3.30 he asks 15 people to leave the room
[07:20:11] <Necrosporus> And also proprietary software in software center, which should be at least possible to disable, but it's not
[07:20:33] <Necrosporus> I do not know about whom you are talking about, I just joined

[07:21:09] <pink_mist> it is not worth wasting your time on :<
[07:22:19] <Necrosporus> But Ubuntu actually deserving some harsh critique for serious reasons
[07:22:26] <wood_quinn> We should all sink to his level and leave nasty comments on his video.
[07:22:32] <KaMii> i get the feeling all he is going to do is talk about the gui sessions and not the linux kernel
[07:22:47] <KaMii> so it should be renamed, why xwindow sucks
[07:22:58] <KaMii> im wondering if he will talk about the kernel?
[07:23:52] <Necrosporus> There is not-quite-free software in Slackware itself too, but as far as I know oracle java should be already got rid of, since it's now prohibited to include, and xv is not closed source, it's just non-free (shareware?)
[07:24:01] <Crosma> Pfft. Cinelerra is better than any of the video editors for other platforms he mentioned.
[07:24:24] <wood_quinn> Necrosporus: Oracle Java isn't included.
[07:24:44] <wood_quinn> And honestly if you want a maintainter that refuses to include non-free software, use Debian and live with old software.
[07:25:00] <Necrosporus> I want new software, but free

[07:26:42] <Necrosporus> Though I doubt there is any benefits from keeping xv in distro
[07:27:09] <Necrosporus> It was included in early 1990th when there were no other picture viewers for GNU/Linux
[07:27:13] <wood_quinn> That could be said about a lot of the software in Slack that was released in 1990 and never updated.
[07:27:31] <Necrosporus> name some
[07:27:53] <mad_enz> KaMii: been thinking about ur container stuff some more
[07:28:24] <KaMii> the guy just said that xorg is older than anyone alive today... hes an idiot and still hasnt said anything or used any examples hes just bitching
[07:28:24] <Necrosporus> I think it could be said only about non-free software or software which does have modern more advanced analogs
[07:28:31] <mad_enz> the decrypting and mount should be simply enough if u stick the process in /etc/profile
[07:28:59] <Necrosporus> xorg is older but it's still most advanced
[07:29:21] <Necrosporus> name any other graphic subsystem with network transparency supported natively
[07:29:24] <mad_enz> the only issue i see what that is the user will have to enter the password twice, once to log in and once to decrypt the volume
[07:29:26] <KaMii> mad_enz: then we need to make sure that user only has the ability to mount $USER-CONTAINER /home/
[07:30:11] <KaMii> xorg isnt that old
[07:30:16] <Necrosporus> mad_enz, afaik Ubuntu can mount home volume on login, not requiring to enter the passord twice
[07:30:17] <KaMii> it wasnt around back in 1930
[07:30:25] <mad_enz> that would be controlled by fstab with the user,noauto mount option
[07:30:51] <d4wnr4z0r> in software years (like dog years, only different) xorg is old.
[07:30:53] <Crosma> X11 is awesome and everyone who doesn't think so is an idiot.
[07:31:04] <KaMii> d4wnr4z0r: im just saying, his statemnt was dumb
[07:31:15] <mad_enz> does ubuntu use dm-crypt or truecrypt for encryption?

[10:43:00] <Urchlay> so qt displays on the framebuffer much better & nicer than gtk
[10:43:20] <pink_mist> awesome :P
[10:43:34] <pink_mist> I wonder ... you can't run more than 1 program at a time like that, can you?
[10:43:53] <Urchlay> yeah, you can, with qt
[10:43:59] <pink_mist> 0_o cool
[10:44:08] <pink_mist> how does that work 0_o
[10:44:15] <Urchlay> you theoretically can with gtk (if you build DirectFB for multi-application support), but it's crashy.
[10:45:03] <Urchlay> well, the first app you start, you have to pass it the -qws option, to make it act as a qt server (which any qt/embedded app can do, theoretically)
[10:45:28] <pink_mist> huh, awesome
[10:45:28] <Urchlay> further ones, you leave off the -qws, and they connect to the existing server (through a unix socket in /tmp)
[10:45:34] <pink_mist> right
[10:45:38] <pink_mist> very cool =)
[10:46:02] <pink_mist> is the directfb on the same vt as you start it on, or does it allocate its own?
[10:46:16] <Urchlay> same you start on
[10:46:19] <pink_mist> right
[10:46:26] <wood_quinn> So it's a tiling window manager on the framebuffer basically.
[10:46:36] <Urchlay> not sure what qt's doing, it doesn't let me change vts
[10:46:59] <pink_mist> oh .. how do you go about starting new programs then?
[10:47:02] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: well, it doesn't actually do tiling, but yeah, it's a very very simple windowmanager
[10:47:32] <Urchlay> pink_mist: so far, ssh in from another box. Also built this so-called qt terminal, which I was able to use to start an app
[10:47:48] <pink_mist> ah, ssh
[10:47:50] <pink_mist> gotcha
[10:47:56] <pink_mist> I *thought* that was what you would do
[10:48:00] <Urchlay> (but it's not a proper terminal, it's more of a command-at-a-time thing, like a run dialog, and it's painful to use)
[10:48:04] <pink_mist> but I had hoped for a better solution :P
[10:48:07] <pink_mist> right
[10:48:23] <Urchlay> well I literally just started messing with this tonight, like maybe 4 hours ago
[10:48:39] <pink_mist> haha, ok :P awesome though :P
[10:49:11] <Urchlay> there's a promising thing called qtpanel, that's basically an app launcher and contains a clock applet. But it isn't pure Qt, it also uses raw Xlib calls
[10:49:19] <Urchlay> (so no getting it to run on the fb)

[10:49:29] <Urchlay> oh, crap, qupzilla actually compiled

[10:52:27] <Urchlay> holy *shit*
[10:52:28] <Urchlay> it runs
[10:52:43] <pink_mist> haha, excellent
[10:53:21] <KaMii> i though you have been using qupzilla for awhile now
[10:53:25] <Urchlay> in X, yes
[10:53:31] <Urchlay> this is qupzilla without X

[10:53:40] <KaMii> ohhhhhh
[10:53:51] <Urchlay> blowing my mind, it didn't need any patching even
[10:54:04] <KaMii> so whats the big fuss with qupzilla?
[10:54:19] <wood_quinn> It's not Firefox.
[10:54:50] <KaMii> dont like chromium?
[10:54:53] <Urchlay> no I don't
[10:55:04] <wood_quinn> *It's not Firefox and it doesn't come from Google.
[10:55:05] <Crosma> Opera is totally tits.
[10:55:12] <Urchlay> opera isn't open source though
[10:55:12] <KaMii> meh, ok i shall build it and see if its worth my time
[10:55:24] <KaMii> opera does not have tits
[10:55:26] <wood_quinn> Personally, I wish people would just support Epiphany if they want a better browser.
[10:55:41] <Urchlay> doesn't that need a ton of gnome deps that aren't in slack?
[10:55:52] <KaMii> thats what I though
[10:55:53] <wood_quinn> Probably, it's GNOME's default browser.

[10:56:03] <KaMii> yea, and now with gnome 3....
[10:56:05] <KaMii> good luck
[10:56:08] <Urchlay> ok, now I'm probably gonna crash qupzilla by trying to watch youtube with it. Here we go...
[10:56:15] <KaMii> lol
[10:56:16] <pink_mist> lol
[10:56:23] <pink_mist> maybe with html5 it would work ...
[10:56:25] <pink_mist> maybe
[10:56:55] <KaMii> oh... qupzilla comes standard with add blocker
[10:57:02] <KaMii> does it have a javascript blocker?
[10:57:09] <KaMii> because i hate javascript
[10:57:15] <Urchlay> whoa
[10:57:15] <Crosma> I don't understand Chrome's popularity. I mean, Opera is similar but better.
[10:57:17] <Urchlay> it's playing

[10:57:38] <Urchlay> well, no, it's loading, and the audio is playing
[10:57:42] <Urchlay> no video though
[10:57:55] <wood_quinn> When one of a browser's features is "Loads entire web pages based on what it thinks you're going to type into the URL bar" I say "No thanks."
[10:58:11] <KaMii> wood_quinn: you can disable that in chromium
[10:58:19] <wood_quinn> Don't care, it's bloat.
[11:00:05] <Urchlay> ok, one video played. 3 others gave me a "you must install adobe flash", and one more is stuck at a black screen with the little "loading" icon spinning
[11:00:07] <wood_quinn> I have similar complaints about Opera's "Cache the internet!" approach.
[11:00:26] <Urchlay> I think maybe it's using html5, and the ones that refuse to play aren't avaiable in html5 yet
[11:00:52] <KaMii> ok, how do I block javascript with qupzilla?
[11:01:10] <KaMii> well, not all javascript, but a noscript addon
[11:01:52] <wood_quinn> You probably can't.
[11:02:12] wbooze (~wbooze@xdsl-78-35-141-40.netcologne.de) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[11:02:45] <Urchlay> it has a built-in adblock plugin though (afaik it uses the same blacklist as adblockplus for firefox)
[11:03:12] <KaMii> Urchlay: i know but i want javascript blocking also
[11:03:21] <wood_quinn> Although I will give props to qupzilla due to the fact that it's actually forkable.
[11:03:49] <Urchlay> you can disable javascript globally in the preferences dialog, but it's kinda cumbersome (edit -> preferences -> whatever -> disable javascript -> OK)

[11:04:40] <Urchlay> wouldn't be too hard to add a button to the main UI to enable/disable js. It would still be manual (not remembering on a per-site basis like noscript does)
[11:05:42] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea, but that will break about every website
[11:06:14] <wood_quinn> Most websites don't require JavaScript, regardless of what they might tell you.
[11:06:15] <KaMii> well if it cant get noscript or at least notscript than Im not interested

[11:09:05] fisted (~fisted@unaffiliated/fisted) joined ##slackware.
[11:10:32] <Urchlay> KaMii: that's why it would be a button *right there* on the toolbar, next to the reload button
[11:10:59] <KaMii> yea, but the option to add a whitelist is required or it just turns into a PITA

[11:11:02] <Urchlay> you would leave it off normally, then when you get to a site that fails to work, click to turn it on, then reload the site
[11:11:18] <Urchlay> (it could even be coded so it auto-reloads, when you toggle it)
[11:11:25] <Urchlay> ...so, 1 click

[11:13:11] <scarrz> greetz
[11:13:25] <wood_quinn> Or you could convince your friendly neighborhood web designer that websites and webapps are different things.
[11:13:45] <KaMii> Urchlay: that would be awesome!
[11:13:46] <Urchlay> generally, they're unfriendly, and they don't live in my neighborhood
[11:14:00] <KaMii> then you can upload it to qupzilla and have them see about integrating it
[11:14:17] <Urchlay> KaMii: no promises, mind you. First I'll talk to the qupzilla developer(s).
[11:14:20] <scarrz> what file do I edit to permanently set the vga mode upon booting? it's asking me every time I boot what resolution I want

[11:21:19] <KaMii> since spanking is legal in the USA and hes an adult
[11:21:42] <wood_quinn> I don't think it's legal for a minor to spank an adult.
[11:21:49] <wood_quinn> DHS wouldn't like it, anyway.
[11:21:52] <pink_mist> happy birthday wood_quinn
[11:22:01] <KaMii> Department of Homeland Security?
[11:22:12] <KaMii> they frisk 5 year old girls
[11:22:13] <wood_quinn> The people who take kids away from parents.
[11:22:16] <KaMii> the bastards
[11:22:21] <KaMii> CPS
[11:22:25] <Urchlay> the spanking itself probably isn't illegal, but usually a spanking given to an adult counts as foreplay, which probably is illegal if a minor does it
[11:22:27] <KaMii> Chile Protective Services
[11:22:45] <Urchlay> chili protective services. In charge of outlawing weak chili recipes.
[11:22:47] <wood_quinn> Chile abuse is a mealony.
[11:22:59] <KaMii> Urchlay: if he gets off on my birthday spanking with the soul pole... than hes about as messed up as Quagmire
[11:23:15] <wood_quinn> Is that a euphemism?
[11:23:20] <wood_quinn> "Soul pole"
[11:23:21] <wood_quinn> Lol.

[11:23:35] <Urchlay> scarrz: all better?
[11:23:47] <KaMii> its a butt paddle stick he drilled holes in and hit the freshman with it on the butt
[11:24:18] <scarrz> well I edited lilo.conf but it's still asking me what mode I want at boot... alittle help? :)

[11:25:01] <Urchlay> KaMii: plenty of people get off on being spanked
[11:25:05] <wood_quinn> KaMii: CPS usually doesn't take kids away from their homes. Their job is to try to find solutions that involve the kid staying with their family.
[11:25:07] <KaMii> Urchlay: they have issues
[11:25:19] <KaMii> wood_quinn: oh, well idk
[11:25:27] <Urchlay> it's common enough that it isn't really all that embarrassing if someone finds out, even
[11:25:42] <KaMii> but i think if someone got whacked in the butt with one of those, they would not be having orgasms

[11:27:19] <KaMii> try vga=771
[11:27:24] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Probably, most browser just output bookmarks as an HTML file with some minor metadata.

[11:27:53] <scarrz> ok
[11:27:54] <Urchlay> you have 'vga = normal' uncommented, did you just now do that?
[11:27:57] <KaMii> so comment out vga = normal
[11:28:08] <scarrz> ok
[11:28:09] <KaMii> and uncomment vga=787
[11:28:09] <Urchlay> and, did you actually run lilo (as the root user) after editing lilo.conf?
[11:28:25] <KaMii> then, save and exit
[11:28:27] <KaMii> then type lilo
[11:28:32] <scarrz> no I didnt.... I just "sudo lilo"?
[11:28:39] <Urchlay> sudo /sbin/lilo
[11:28:44] <scarrz> ok
[11:28:47] <scarrz> tyvm
[11:28:47] <Urchlay> unless you actually have /sbin in your user's $PATH
[11:28:49] <KaMii> Urchlay: you sudo?
[11:28:51] <scarrz> noo nee noo
[11:28:53] <Urchlay> I do
[11:29:14] <KaMii> hrm... i dont
[11:29:45] <Urchlay> why, because ubuntu recommends it? sudo has been around a lot longer than ubuntu (and longer than linux, even, it dates back to the late 80s IIRC)
[11:30:04] <KaMii> no, i just never got into the habbit of sudoing
[11:30:16] <KaMii> if i need to do something that requires root, i just su

[11:34:45] <scarrz> success
[11:34:48] <Urchlay> angryblack: never heard of it. Where's it come from?
[11:34:50] <scarrz> thanx guys
[11:35:07] <angryblack> Urchlay: its some forensic disk data recovery tool
[11:35:24] <Urchlay> this? http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.0/system/testdisk/
[11:36:11] <Urchlay> I've never used it, but if you're having trouble using it on slackware, you could email the slackbuilds.org maintainer
[11:36:38] <wood_quinn> I should buy some plants.
[11:37:44] <scarrz> how often does slackware come out with a new release... (just wondering)
[11:38:11] <wood_quinn> Typically just under once a year.
[11:38:17] lightbulbjim (~chris@colin.killred.net) joined ##slackware.
[11:38:18] <scarrz> k
[11:39:09] <wood_quinn> It depends on the number of changes.
[11:39:36] <wood_quinn> Sometimes there are more releases when big things get changed, so people can simply not do a release upgrade to avoid the change.
[11:39:46] <scarrz> well I'm impressed with the whole KDE thing... it's nicely complete :)
[11:41:12] <wood_quinn> I should try KDE with nVidia's proprietary drivers.
[11:41:23] <KaMii> bleh
[11:41:31] <KaMii> kde... vomit
[11:41:34] <wood_quinn> I try it about once a year.
[11:41:42] <wood_quinn> Usually for about an hour.
[11:41:45] <scarrz> lol
[11:41:49] <KaMii> i stopped using it after 4.0
[11:42:29] <wood_quinn> I like the idea of widgets and stuff, but usually the performance detriment makes it not worth it.
[11:42:32] <KaMii> switched to xfce, havent been happier
[11:42:42] <KaMii> i hate widgets
[11:42:50] <KaMii> but if you need them i think compiz can do them
[11:43:18] <scarrz> I don't typically use KDE, I'm a gnome man myself... but I'm looking for an excuse to migrate from one other distro to slack... I'm just having problems getting used to installing vmware which is unfortunately kinda essential to me :)
[11:43:43] <KaMii> wood_quinn: Urchlay bug alert for qupzilla, it doesnt import any bookmarks
[11:43:44] <wood_quinn> Is VMware essential or just a virtualization solution in general?
[11:43:51] <scarrz> well
[11:43:53] <KaMii> tried html bookmarks and chromium bookmarks
[11:44:08] <scarrz> I like the opengl support vmware offers
[11:44:38] <wood_quinn> I'm not sure what that means. You mean it offers accelleration to guests?
[11:44:43] <scarrz> yes
[11:44:51] <wood_quinn> VirtualBox does that.
[11:45:00] <wood_quinn> Both 2D (for your Windows guests) and 3D.
[11:45:20] <scarrz> really, I tried with ubuntu and I couldn't frag...
[11:46:01] <KaMii> hrm, why wont it import my bookmarks?
[11:46:12] <wood_quinn> Are you using su -?
[11:46:48] <KaMii> i should not have to be root to import bookmarks
[11:46:54] <wood_quinn> Well there you go.
[11:46:57] <KaMii> thats just crazy talk
[11:47:03] <wood_quinn> It's allowed to disobey when you're not root.
[11:47:11] <wood_quinn> It's just excersizing that.
[11:47:13] <KaMii> i hope your joking
[11:47:18] <wood_quinn> I am haha.
[11:48:06] <KaMii> because if it wanted to save bookmarks in /usr/bin/qupzilla/.config/bookmarks  then I would removepkg qupzilla*
[11:49:02] <KaMii> and im not getting any output when I try to import bookmarks while running it from a terminal
[11:49:16] <KaMii> have you tried to import a bookmark?
[11:49:24] mikef (~mikef@197.177.35.205) joined ##slackware.
[11:49:26] <Urchlay> I haven't
[11:49:27] <wood_quinn> Nope.
[11:49:40] <wood_quinn> I don't really use bookmarks, I just rely on browser history.
[11:49:53] <KaMii> well... it dont work
[11:50:35] <KaMii> oh, i always delete browser history when i close the browswer, and im always running the brwoswer in private browsing mode
[11:50:41] <KaMii> so really there is nothing to delete
[11:50:51] <wood_quinn> That would bug me.
[11:52:27] <KaMii> oh... apparently i need some libqt4-sql-sqlite
[11:52:41] <wood_quinn> Ah.
[11:52:45] <wood_quinn> Wierd.
[11:52:46] <KaMii> thats just dumb
[11:52:50] <KaMii> i dont want to run a database
[11:52:58] <KaMii> just for a fucking bookmark
[11:53:06] <wood_quinn> sqlite is a database engine used to store bookmarks and some other data.
[11:53:08] <KaMii> make a txt file ffs
[11:53:12] <wood_quinn> IIRC Firefox ships it's own.
[11:53:15] <Urchlay> eh, it's working here
[11:53:23] <KaMii> Urchlay: i dont have a full install
[11:53:30] <Urchlay> I calculate not.
[11:53:41] <KaMii> anything kde is not installed so some qt lib is probably missing
[11:54:00] <Urchlay> qt libs are not KDE libs
[11:54:11] <fuzzix> sqlite is embedded, you don't run a server or anything like that. It's pretty lightweight.
[11:54:40] <KaMii> Urchlay: well, what am i missing
[11:54:43] <wood_quinn> Also, Slack 13.37 doesn't come with any sqlite libs.
[11:54:44] <fuzzix> Why Qt wraps it... Probably some horrific C++ ORM
[11:54:47] <KaMii> because i do have some libs missing
[11:55:10] <Urchlay> I dunno. There's a /usr/lib/qt/lib/libQtSql.so.4.8.2
[11:55:10] <wood_quinn> Nor does 14.0
[11:55:17] <Urchlay> but it's in the qt package
[11:55:30] <Urchlay> if you didn't have that package installed, you couldn't be running qupzilla at all
[11:55:37] <Urchlay> do you have sqlite installed?
[11:55:47] <fuzzix> Ugh, a full install includes php - not doing that again.
[11:55:54] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea, i have that too
[11:56:26] <Urchlay> I dunno then
[11:56:30] <KaMii> yea, I have sqlite
[11:56:50] <KaMii> well, Urchlay didnt use the slackbuild
[11:56:56] <Urchlay> well, I sort-of did
[11:57:00] <KaMii> wood_quinn: try to add a bookmark, see if it works
[11:57:11] <KaMii> if it doesnt, then we know the slackbuild is borked
[11:57:48] <Urchlay> all I changed in the qupzilla slackbuild was to set some environment variables to make it use my own qt libs in /opt/qt4-fb/lib
[11:58:10] <KaMii> maybe thats why yours works
[11:58:11] <Urchlay> and those qt libs were built by a modified version of Pat's qt.SlackBuild
[11:58:25] <Urchlay> I didn't change anything in the qt build relating to SQL
[11:59:32] <Urchlay> try it on a full slackware install, if you can't otherwise troubleshoot it?

[12:02:33] <KaMii> well when i run from a terminal i get no output

[12:04:52] <KaMii> wait..... i bet i know why
[12:04:57] <Urchlay> it probably auto-detected that some library was missing, and left out the stuff that needs that library
[12:04:59] <KaMii> its because im running it in private browsing mode
[12:05:04] <Urchlay> uh, yeah
[12:05:10] <KaMii> thats fucking retarded
[12:05:25] <KaMii> i should beable to add a bookmark when im in private browsing mode
[12:05:40] <KaMii> removepkg qupzilla*
[12:05:57] <KaMii> its worthless to me
[12:06:08] <Urchlay> ehh
[12:06:26] <Urchlay> private browsing mode probably means "don't write anything at all to the disk"
[12:06:32] <Urchlay> so how should it save bookmarks?
[12:06:46] <KaMii> well, ff and chrome and chromium all you to save a bookmark
[12:06:54] <KaMii> its just a bookmark
[12:07:00] <KaMii> i dont see the secruity risk
[12:07:07] <hoonforever> are u using a beta chromium?
[12:07:12] <KaMii> no
[12:07:14] <Urchlay> $new_software doesn't work exactly the same way as $old_software, are you really surprised?
[12:07:26] <KaMii> hoonforever: well technically chromium is always beta
[12:07:49] <KaMii> Urchlay: well yes, i would have expected to have the ability to add a bookmark
[12:08:38] <Urchlay> in "super secure, never write any data to the disk" mode? maybe qupzilla's private browsing mode is actually more private than ff and chromium?
[12:08:41] <KaMii> since all a bookmark does is just add a new line in .foo/Default/bookmark
[12:08:47] <KaMii> genearlly speaking
[12:09:00] <Urchlay> yes, but. Javascript code can add bookmarks too.
[12:09:00] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea, its ultra paranoid
[12:09:03] <hoonforever> when ingognito is selected it is told in the warning bookmarks will be preserved
[12:09:23] <Urchlay> and I think javascript code can also *read* your bookmarks
[12:09:28] <KaMii> but what doesnt make sense is, if its soo paraiond mode on private browsing, why dont they have a noscript function?
[12:10:00] <Urchlay> the guy's probably more concerned with getting to actually work properly as a browser, render things right, play videos, etc

[12:16:27] <Crosma> What's wrong with slack.eu?
[12:16:31] <Crosma> slacky. Whatever.
[12:16:51] <Urchlay> actually, wait. Are they the same people as linuxpackages.net?
[12:17:03] <Urchlay> if not, then forget I said anything
[12:17:04] <wood_quinn> Other than the fact that they can't seem to pick a language to use?
[12:17:05] <hoonforever> i'm not sure
[12:17:09] <wood_quinn> It is.
[12:17:09] <KaMii> most slackers prefer to compile their own third-party sources, except for libreoffice
[12:17:35] <hoonforever> Its not hard to decipher the website
[12:17:50] <wood_quinn> I shouldn't have to decipher it to begin with.
[12:17:53] <Urchlay> I tend to use slackbuilds.org (and contribute my builds there)
[12:17:59] <hoonforever> I use their packages when I'm in a rush
[12:18:24] <wood_quinn> If they want to be an Italian Linux Community their website shouldn't be in English while all content is in Italian.
[12:18:24] <Urchlay> linuxpackages, I remember getting a few broken packages from (years ago), and getting some that didn't include the SlackBuild
[12:18:36] <wood_quinn> And they shouldn't be using a .eu domain, but that's a lesser gripe.
[12:18:37] <Urchlay> slacky.eu I haven't used at all IIRC
[12:18:49] <Crosma> No, I haven't used slacky.eu ever.
[12:20:23] <wood_quinn> The thing I like about SBo is that they're fairly well integrated with the existing ##slackware and LQ subforum.
[12:20:49] <hoonforever> i swear by slacky
[12:20:54] <wood_quinn> Instead of trying to be a seperate community.

[12:37:27] <Urchlay> they're geeks
[12:37:43] <KaMii> Urchlay: can you find the private-browsing part of the source code?
[12:37:47] <Urchlay> and AFAIK they're working for free
[12:37:51] <Urchlay> I probably could
[12:38:04] <KaMii> im wondering if its just possible to add a few lines that allow for adding bookmarks
[12:38:14] <Urchlay> not going to delve into it right now, am up to my knees in razorqt-runner code at the moment
[12:38:36] <KaMii> im on their git looking, but not sure where its hiding
[12:38:55] <Urchlay> download the source, extract the tarball, start grepping
[12:39:03] <Urchlay> cd /path/to/source
[12:39:08] <Urchlay> grep -ri private.*brow .
[12:39:22] <Urchlay> also maybe: find . -name \*private\*
[12:39:57] <Urchlay> "on their git" means you're using a web browser, which means you're basically fighting a battle armed with a spoon
[12:41:04] <hoonforever> Urchlay: working with libs or x.org?
[12:41:13] <Urchlay> right now, no X
[12:41:20] <KaMii> ok found
[12:41:32] <Urchlay> trying to see if I can get parts of razorqt to run with qt-embedded (built for the framebuffer)
[12:41:56] <Urchlay> specifically, the "runner" (which seems to be a 'run program' dialog)
[12:42:40] mikef (~mikef@197.178.231.219) joined ##slackware.
[12:43:06] <Urchlay> as far as I can tell, there's no way to run non-qt apps on the same console as qt is using. And there's no qt-only terminal where I can type commands... so it's sorta hard to start a 2nd app.
[12:43:23] <Urchlay> (can do it remotely with ssh)
[12:45:02] <hoonforever> uhhm
[12:45:10] <Urchlay> uhm?
[12:45:18] <hoonforever> thinkin
[12:46:14] <Urchlay> yeah. I found a thing called QExTerm that calls itself a terminal, but it's awful. It *can* start other apps though (it's someone's attempt at a "run application" dialog, from what I can tell)
[12:47:14] <Urchlay> razorqt looks pretty nice. Depends on X11 some, but it ought to be possible to hack it into shape
[12:47:21] <Urchlay> (at least, the parts of it I care about)

[15:10:33] <phrag> I have an issue with two routers. Router A is connected to my WAN. When PC connected directly to router A, i get 100% WAN bandwidth. PC --> Router B --> Router A, i get 60% WAN bandwidth. MTU is 1500 on all 1Gbit links. In bridged mode PC --> B --> A i also get 100% WAN. So something in the LAN routing i'm dropping bandwidth. We're talking about a 500Mbit WAN link, so dropping ~150Mbit. Any idea's?
[15:13:48] Action: wood_quinn has an idea
[15:13:51] <Yaroslaw> Check if there is no other electromagnetic wireless device which interferes signal.

[15:17:29] <wood_quinn> Weird. You'd think the supplied one would be the one causing problems.
[15:17:34] <Yaroslaw> Hmm... If it's Ethernet check the cable. Weak quality cables are vulnerable for interferes. Or check the router setting (probably QoS settings).

[15:20:06] <phrag> wow, it looks cold outside =P
[15:20:07] <BrokenCog> here's something which has me stumped.  install 14.0.  reboot, create user/check snd.  reboot.  login, have no sound, alsa "lost" the device.  anyone seen anything like this???
[15:20:27] <BrokenCog> and the user is no longer in the groups he was added to.
[15:20:48] <BrokenCog> re-adding to the groups, rebooting, doesn't fix snd.
[15:20:51] <Skywise> try rebooting again
[15:21:07] <Skywise> it might of failed initialization in bios
[15:21:13] <wood_quinn> If you haven't changed CONSOLE_GROUPS then you shouldn't have any problems with sound due to groups.
[15:21:48] <BrokenCog> maybe.  i'll try it a fourth time.  sound had been working fine for weeks on the 14.0 install, so i have no idea why it suddenly quit.  maybe it's too cold.
[15:22:40] <BrokenCog> oh, and it does it on TWO different computers.
[15:22:59] <Skywise> thats really odd, but don't do a warm reboot
[15:23:03] <BrokenCog> i re-installed with new passwords b/c ... well ... that's what it seemed like a likely problem.
[15:23:09] <BrokenCog> Skywise: yeah.
[15:23:09] <Skywise> shutdown, wait a few secs and power it up
[15:23:23] <BrokenCog> need to re-add groups first ...
[15:24:24] <BrokenCog> how does user get removed from group users??

[15:32:27] Action: BrokenCog bows in shameful acknowledgement.
[15:32:57] <ananke> Strum: you should look up a basic guide on sudo, so you understand how it works. sudo syntax is dreadful to people who haven't seen it before
[15:33:17] <wood_quinn> Especially with the lack of examples in /etc/sudoers
[15:33:22] <BrokenCog> well, power off for a minute cures the sound issue ... still don't know what wiped the group file.  ah well, now I copied it.
[15:33:42] <Strum> no need to be rude wood_quinn
[15:33:49] <wood_quinn> I'm not being rude.
[15:34:05] <Strum> actually you were
[15:34:09] <wood_quinn> If you want help with a problem, do your own research before asking other people to do it for you.
[15:34:11] <wood_quinn> I'm not being rude.
[15:34:21] <Strum> yeah you are
[15:34:35] <wood_quinn> You keep telling yourself that instead of doing said research.
[15:35:23] <Strum> why the fuck did you say anything at all if you didn't want to be helpful\
[15:35:32] <Crosma> I don't think you're supposed to use sudo on Slackware anyway.
[15:35:33] <Strum> get off your ego trip
[15:36:01] <ananke> Crosma: you can use sudo on any system
[15:36:03] <wood_quinn> Who's going on an ego trip, assuming I shouldn't speak unless I'm helping you.
[15:36:15] <Strum> you didn't help
[15:36:22] <Strum> and then you made a bunch of smart arse remarks
[15:36:29] <Strum> better you had just said nothing
[15:36:32] <wood_quinn> Actually, I did. You just didn't like the suggestion to do your own research.
[15:36:40] <Crosma> I know you can use sudo, but Slackware users seem to use su.
[15:36:43] <ananke> Crosma: while it's not necessary to perform admin tasks, like you'd have to do with ubuntu, sudo is still a valid solution for a lot of situations on slackware
[15:36:50] <wood_quinn> Clearly, you abhor the idea, or you'd have done it by now.
[15:37:00] <ananke> Crosma: su and sudo are not functionally identical
[15:37:05] <Crosma> I know they're not.
[15:37:17] <Strum> rails wants it not me
[15:37:26] <Strum> i am trying to get stared with rails
[15:37:33] <wood_quinn> That's relevant.
[15:37:34] <Strum> and it want the user in the sudoers file ok
[15:37:40] <ananke> Strum: i imagine rails documentation would have an example
[15:37:42] <Strum> i thought it might be a trivial thing \
[15:37:45] <Strum> and thats why i asked
[15:37:50] <wood_quinn> It is a trivial thing.
[15:37:56] <wood_quinn> Reading the file shows that.
[15:38:06] <ananke> Strum: because 'being in sudoers' does not actually reveal what permissions it would need
[15:38:23] <wood_quinn> The example they give only needs to be modified in one way, changing "root" to "user"
[15:38:33] <Crosma> Just chmod everything to 777.
[15:38:39] <Crosma> Don't do that.
[15:38:53] <wood_quinn> And, if you want to tighten up the security, read man sudoers to figure out how to only allow that user to run certain things as root.
[15:40:52] <Skywise> if you really wanna tighten up security, don't let users on your system

[16:52:42] <n1x4> It's a little lighter. Not by much but a little. Really helps not running any compositors too.

[18:47:58] <KaMii> people that put fruit in waffles or pancakes have serious issues
[18:48:09] <pi31415> banana waffles are good too
[18:48:21] <KaMii> nope
[18:48:21] <pi31415> karmelized bananas, yum!
[18:48:23] <shonudo> wtf? it's a pathology in your opinion, KaMii?
[18:48:32] <shonudo> it's yummy
[18:48:39] <KaMii> no no no,
[18:48:44] <shonudo> blueberry waffles, muffins
[18:48:47] <shonudo> all good
[18:49:04] <KaMii> the same people put nuts in cakes and breads.. ruining them forever
[18:49:16] <shonudo> o_0
[18:49:18] <KaMii> or raisins in breads or nuts...
[18:49:24] <KaMii> its just wrong

[18:58:38] <peaceblaster> reinstalled Slackware, added user "jude", made /home/jude, changed own to jude, ran chmod 400 on it, but now when I change user to "jude" it says /home/jude/.bashrc permissions denied
[18:58:51] <Skywise> capsasin only reacts with mammals because their slow digestion destroys the seeds
[18:59:12] <KaMii> dont chmod things
[18:59:35] <Skywise> when you adduser it should already create the home directory
[18:59:36] <d4wnr4z0r> in particular, don't make directories unexecutable, or they won't be able to execute.
[19:00:13] <peaceblaster> I thought it would too... but apparently not
[19:00:16] <Skywise> i would expect at least 700 in your own home directory
[19:00:22] <peaceblaster> I'll try deleting/readding the user
[19:00:33] <Skywise> or more like 750 is more sane
[19:00:37] <d4wnr4z0r> just make your home directory executable.
[19:00:44] <KaMii> you dont need to remove the user
[19:00:46] <d4wnr4z0r> or user the -m flag if you recreate
[19:00:47] <peaceblaster> how do you userdel someone who is "logged in"?
[19:00:50] <Skywise> what made you think of 400
[19:00:54] <Skywise> log them out
[19:00:59] <KaMii> just chmod ~/
[19:01:07] <peaceblaster> that's what a tutorial I found said =p
[19:01:16] <Skywise> bizzare
[19:01:28] <Skywise> discard that tutorial, its patently wrong
[19:01:31] <d4wnr4z0r> following random instructions without understanding, you deserve what you get.
[19:01:32] <nyteowl> 400 is read only for owner and nohign for anyone else
[19:01:41] <peaceblaster> so it should be useradd jude -m ?
[19:01:53] <KaMii> use adduser
[19:01:54] <d4wnr4z0r> man useradd
[19:01:56] <peaceblaster> it did seem REALLY odd that it didn't add a home folder for me
[19:02:03] <peaceblaster> k
[19:02:08] <KaMii> if you cant figure out how to use useradd then use adduser instead
[19:02:39] <KaMii> and stop chmodding things
[19:02:51] <d4wnr4z0r> and read man chmod while you're at it so you can understand why setting directories to 400 is not going to work like you might think
[19:03:36] <peaceblaster> ok
[19:03:41] <KaMii> lol, think he feels like we tore him a new one?
[19:04:05] <KaMii> as a rule, i dont trust bob's linux blog
[19:04:46] <pi31415> where is bob's linux blog?
[19:05:03] <Cultist> on the net
[19:05:04] <Cultist> ...
[19:05:05] <KaMii> because bob is probably a ubuntu n00b that just installed linux the very first time an hour ago and has no idea what hes doing... but he made a blog just to tell himself what steps he took
[19:05:08] <d4wnr4z0r> a common mistake these days. people forget to read the instructions that came with and instead go read whatever they find on google, written by someone who has no idea what s/he is doing.
[19:05:44] <zenlunatic> or you can do like arch and remove all documentation
[19:05:49] <zenlunatic> that really helps
[19:05:59] <d4wnr4z0r> arch doesn't count in any sane discussion of, well, anything.
[19:06:07] <pi31415> sometimes the documentation is incomplete or flat out wrong
[19:06:09] Action: zenlunatic agrees
[19:06:28] <KaMii> d4wnr4z0r: who needs /f anyway?
[19:06:30] <pi31415> arch removes the docs?
[19:06:45] <d4wnr4z0r> KaMii: s/needs/reads
[19:06:50] <n1x4> you can opt to not install them
[19:06:50] <zenlunatic> yeah they do plus jacked up the licenses
[19:06:52] <KaMii> lol
[19:07:05] <peaceblaster> So man pages > google ?
[19:07:10] <zenlunatic> they got in trouble for removing/moving licenses for packages
[19:07:21] <pi31415> man pages work even when you don't have an Internet connection
[19:07:45] <KaMii> peaceblaster: man pages, then the slackware wiki, then linuxquestions forums, then ##slackware on freenode, then google
[19:07:45] <d4wnr4z0r> peaceblaster: for a number of reasons. they are more trustworthy. they will also pertain to your specific system. they contain a ton of good information. etc.
[19:08:05] <pi31415> it's one thing i like about Perl and TCL: good offline documentation
[19:08:21] <d4wnr4z0r> perldoc is sick.
[19:08:30] <pi31415> howso?
[19:08:45] <peaceblaster> Perl's offline docs are amazing I thought, but I'm sort of a n00b
[19:08:46] <Skywise> was that tutorial even for slackware or some spinoff
[19:09:25] <Skywise> cause on slackware, useradd/adduser makes the directories for ya
[19:09:26] <peaceblaster> it was for Ubuntu lol
[19:09:37] <n1x4> ./facepalm
[19:09:40] <Skywise> yeah i could tell it was fucked up
[19:09:43] <d4wnr4z0r> sick is a complement.
[19:09:57] <KaMii> east coast?
[19:10:07] <d4wnr4z0r> actually, a compliment
[19:10:48] <peaceblaster> What was that program called that lets you make Linux drivers out of Windows ones?
[19:10:56] <KaMii> no thats right, east coast says 'wicked'  West saieed says 'sick'  (but thats just Kalifornia)

[19:11:41] <KaMii> what do you need/want it for?
[19:12:07] <KaMii> because im just wanting to stop you from making a horrible mistake then coming in here asking why your wifi doesnt work
[19:12:36] <peaceblaster> SLack didn't recognize my USB wifi adapter by default is all
[19:12:44] <KaMii> dont blame slack
[19:12:54] <peaceblaster> Netgear WAN1100
[19:13:00] <KaMii> first of all, boot into the huge.s kernel, and see if that finds it
[19:13:03] <peaceblaster> ik
[19:13:16] <peaceblaster> k
[19:13:44] <KaMii> i would heavily advise against using a microsoft driver hack in linux
[19:13:54] <peaceblaster> Fedora is the only OS that's recognized it out of the box... not even Windows lol
[19:14:06] <d4wnr4z0r> that means there are linux drivers.

[19:15:14] <peaceblaster> used full DVD
[19:15:14] <KaMii> peaceblaster: you need to edit your /etc/lilo.conf file and add the huge kernel
[19:15:29] <KaMii> then re-run lilo
[19:15:32] <peaceblaster> ok, add what where?
[19:15:46] <d4wnr4z0r> man 5 lilo.conf
[19:15:46] <peaceblaster> I had to mess with lilo.conf a lot getting this working =/
[19:16:00] <Skywise> hmm
[19:16:03] <KaMii> ok peaceblaster if you cannot figure out llilo... im pretty sure you will not beable to even get wifi working on your own
[19:16:10] <KaMii> time to do some reading of manuals
[19:16:28] <adaptr> it migh thelp if a sultry teen read the manual to him
[19:16:35] <adaptr> I know it would help me
[19:16:49] <d4wnr4z0r> I don't think it would help me.
[19:16:58] <d4wnr4z0r> I mean, not with understanding the technical stuff, anyway.
[19:17:03] <KaMii> adding a list of kernels in lilo is about the easiest thing to do in lilo.conf... and why would you need to mess with lilo.conf anyway?
[19:17:34] <KaMii> what was wrong before that caused you to need to mess with lilo?
[19:17:37] <peaceblaster> I had trouble with it freezing during boot so I had to add append acpi=off

[19:19:30] <KaMii> peaceblaster: hint, dont worry about the .s  and look in /boot
[19:19:56] <KaMii> but if lspci shows your wifi then i would say you might not need to mess with the huge kernel

[19:20:56] <KaMii> i thought it was an internal laptop

[19:25:02] <peaceblaster> that is the EXACT one I have
[19:25:10] <KaMii> then you need a newer kernel
[19:25:14] <KaMii> i had the same issue
[19:25:19] <KaMii> slackwares kerenl is too old
[19:25:28] <KaMii> you need at least kernel 3.6.6
[19:25:42] <KaMii> i suggest going to kerenl.org grab 3.7.4

[19:32:15] <peaceblaster> ok, so how do I go about wicd then?

[19:35:19] <KaMii> how many cores?
[19:35:41] <KaMii> just make sure when you do make, you do make -j(insert number of cores)
[19:36:04] <KaMii> if you just do make, it will only use one core and it will take FOREVER to compile
[19:36:47] <peaceblaster> quad core

[19:40:59] <peaceblaster> SORRY!!!!
[19:41:04] <peaceblaster> it's all good now
[19:41:34] <KaMii> ... maybe i should just send him my kernel config
[19:41:44] <KaMii> no... because im not going to do that
[19:41:54] <KaMii> it probably wouldnt work on your system
[19:42:05] <KaMii> and you wont learn
[19:43:13] <KaMii> peaceblaster: are you on 32 or 64 bit?
[19:43:15] <peaceblaster> I am actually trying to learn btw, not just mooching. That's part of the reason I decided to isntall slack
[19:43:32] <peaceblaster> I'm on 64 bit
[19:43:38] <KaMii> how much ram do you havec?
[19:43:49] <peaceblaster> i686
[19:43:58] <peaceblaster> 4GB RAM, 2GB swap
[19:44:21] <KaMii> ok then you dont need to worry about high mem support but best to check that out when your in the kernel config
[19:44:38] <peaceblaster> k
[19:44:58] <KaMii> well i dont run 64 bit and i dont have more than 4 gigs of ram so Im not even sure if your configs are different...
[19:45:43] <KaMii> ok well the guide i showed you does have you check for ram so thats good
[19:46:09] <peaceblaster> ok, I have the kernel as .tar.bz2 on a flashdrive
[19:46:12] <peaceblaster> hurray
[19:47:09] <KaMii> well did you copy over the md6sum also?
[19:47:14] <KaMii> md5sum rather
[19:47:26] <KaMii> so you can check to make sure you have everything?

[20:10:06] <d4wnr4z0r> period?
[20:10:08] <KaMii> maybe its just from sitting in this chair
[20:11:40] <peaceblaster> can also happen from eating too much sodium
[20:11:48] <Joseph_Sod> move da body! find some tunes and dance a jig!

[20:18:31] <Cultist> I wonder if there would be a market for engagement rings made with kidney stones instead of diamonds
[20:18:53] <n1x4> Could be an infection too... Hell it could be a million things but until you're doubled over and not able to move or urinating blood, don't fret.
[20:19:21] <n1x4> Drink less pop?

[20:45:03] <peaceblaster> that would explain some things
[20:45:04] <XGizzmo> What ever peaceblaster changed it has the kernel for slackgcc which wil never exist.
[20:45:23] <KaMii> yea.. he changed something somewhere
[20:45:32] <n1x4> I was wondering about that slackgcc
[20:45:41] <KaMii> peaceblaster: you need to do a make mrproper and start all over from the beginning
[20:45:53] <KaMii> do not use the config you have been using
[20:45:54] <peaceblaster> ok
[20:45:58] <peaceblaster> restarting again DX
[20:46:12] <KaMii> because you put something somewere where it doesnt belong
[20:46:22] <peaceblaster> what exactly did I mess up?
[20:46:26] <n1x4> use the current kernel cfg
[20:46:38] <KaMii> yea, that might be good also
[20:46:59] <KaMii> grab the config off the -current tree from your favorite slackware mirror

[20:53:17] <KaMii> d4wnr4z0r: not really... if the tuts never build the pyramids and the aliens did, then hes not a tut
[20:53:22] <KaMii> hes just an alien named bob
[20:53:29] <d4wnr4z0r> pink_mist: you can't, because it is infallible. this is why it confuses you.
[20:53:47] <KaMii> i belive i pointed out the flaw
[20:54:27] <pink_mist> d4wnr4z0r: well .. the only flaw is that tut wasn't buried in a pyramid :P the rest makes perfect sense though :P

[20:54:58] <KaMii> he said the aliens build the pyramids, not the tut's
[20:55:13] <KaMii> therefore that means alienBOB is not a tut, hes just a pyramid builder

[21:20:35] <KaMii> he probably didnt enable any pci

[21:23:31] <KaMii> hrm... ok, maybe 3.7.4 is too new or something wonky
[21:23:42] <peaceblaster> where's 3.7.1? kernel.org only has 3.7.4 and 3.7
[21:23:54] <core_saint> why is he getting newer kernel?
[21:24:01] <KaMii> but apparently we both have the exact same wifi usb adapter and mine works on slack 14 with the 3.7.1 kernel

[21:43:03] <n1x4> close the tray before hand?
[21:43:27] <CyberOwl> but before closing I already have this message saying that it couldn't mount
[21:43:41] <n1x4> close it first
[21:43:48] <KaMii> oops did i give him the -smp kernel config or not?
[21:43:55] <CyberOwl> before 13.37, it closed, checked the drive and if couldn't mount gave me a message
[21:43:57] <KaMii> i think i didnt give him the -smp config
[21:44:07] <n1x4> KaMii: not sure....
[21:44:33] <n1x4> He's 'having a life' anyways ;)
[21:44:35] <core_saint> KaMii, what adapter is that?
[21:44:36] <CyberOwl> if i close it first and wait two seconds no problem
[21:45:01] <n1x4> CyberOwl: then just do that... Seems proper anyways.
[21:45:02] <CyberOwl> but have to wait two seconds, just would like to know what changed...

[21:53:02] <KaMii> ok im building the 3.7.4
[21:53:22] <KaMii> and its still building
[21:53:27] <KaMii> so i guess im passed his part
[21:53:33] <KaMii> and this is on a 6 core amd
[21:53:34] <n1x4> :P
[21:53:41] <n1x4> I just, JUST, finished..
[21:53:47] <n1x4> installing modules now
[21:53:48] <KaMii> really?
[21:54:03] <n1x4> yea, it's an old P4 I'm on right now
[21:54:05] <KaMii> awww, i decided to go through the settings and turn things off I dont want
[21:54:12] <KaMii> like bluetooth
[21:54:19] <n1x4> Always disable BT
[21:54:29] <KaMii> well since i dont have any bt i just always disable it
[21:54:29] <n1x4> I do anyways, and the FS i don't need
[21:54:35] <n1x4> Exactly
[21:55:03] <KaMii> i keep the fs i dont think i need as modueles, becasuse when I decied to switch my /home over to xfs. i had isses
[21:55:51] <KaMii> and why is the x86 template have high mem support as default?
[21:56:03] <KaMii> i dont have more than 4 gigs ram
[21:56:22] <Urchlay> you must not be in soviet russia. Everyone knows in soviet russia, issues has you. But your issues doesn't have u...
[21:56:22] <KaMii> or is having more than 4 just standard now, so pat switched it to the 64 gig option
[21:57:01] <n1x4> Uhhh, never paid attn to that... I usually use my current config to compile so I really don't have to edit much once I do the first..
[21:57:01] <KaMii> ok, sitting in this chair the kidney pain is coming back
[21:57:05] <KaMii> so im blaming the chair
[21:57:22] <KaMii> n1x4: well I used the -current config, because thats the one I told him to use
[21:57:28] <KaMii> (as a template)
[21:57:33] <Urchlay> KaMii: how long have you been awake?
[21:57:42] <KaMii> 26 hours
[21:57:44] <Urchlay> like, have you slept since I last talked to you?
[21:57:49] <n1x4> Oh... I mean current as in MY current /proc/config.gz
[21:57:51] <KaMii> and im not even close to being tired
[21:58:03] <Urchlay> oh. Eh, that might have something to do with your kidney pain.
[21:58:12] <KaMii> n1x4: yea but i wanted to rule out something
[21:58:19] <n1x4> Right on....
[21:58:23] <KaMii> Urchlay: well... insomnia is just a normal thing for me
[21:58:27] <Urchlay> go take 3 or 4 benadryl, you'll sleep good, and feel better after.
[21:58:46] <Urchlay> (don't get in the habit of taking it all the time though, you'll get where you can't sleep without it)
[21:58:58] <KaMii> and its still compiling, so i bet he turned off serial and pci accidentally... or lol i bet he didnt put the config in the right place
[21:59:03] <KaMii> and thats why it compiled so fast
[21:59:14] <KaMii> have you ever done that, just did a make mrproper then make -j6
[21:59:18] <KaMii> it goes really fast
[21:59:36] <KaMii> i bet he had his .config somewhere else
[22:00:04] <KaMii> n1x4: do a make mrproper && make -j(whatever)

[22:04:19] <n1x4> Yup

[23:30:51] <n1x4> KaMii: you noticed a slight increse in cpu usage with 3.7.4?
[23:31:16] <KaMii> n1x4: no, but i did notice a slight increase in performance when xfce starts

[23:33:08] <KaMii> you got a hit to performance?
[23:33:13] <n1x4> ditto.... htop reads a .6% increase every now and then... Ahh well, nothing major just trying to see if I had something load unintentionally

[23:33:40] <KaMii> well oh i know why i had that performance increaset
[23:33:49] <KaMii> i unplugged my external usb drive
[23:33:57] <KaMii> theres a bug in xfce thats annoying
[23:34:49] core_saint (~core_sain@89-74-182-131.dynamic.chello.pl) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[23:34:54] <n1x4> Ummm, haven't noticed that one...
[23:35:02] <KaMii> when you plug in an external usb drive it loads some program that generates icons, and it doesnt work so it jsut sits there and constantly tries to make icons but never can, then it doesnt allow you to dismount
[23:35:06] <KaMii> so you have to force it to dismount
[23:35:15] core_saint (~core_sain@89-74-182-131.dynamic.chello.pl) joined ##slackware.
[23:35:45] <KaMii> it also keeps spinning that drive causing a constant flow of input output for you hdd... probably slowly killing the drive
[23:36:00] <KaMii> tumblered is the name of the process
[23:36:05] <KaMii> or.. tumblerd
[23:36:16] <KaMii> cant remember the correct spelling, i think its in /lib somewhere
[23:36:39] <KaMii> IMO its a serious but that needs quick attention
[23:36:48] <KaMii> s/but/bug
[23:37:15] <n1x4> I'm not seeing it... My usb umounts as soon as I unplug it...
[23:37:36] <KaMii> on my intel i7 when I plug in a external usb drive, i get tublerd sitting on the number one spot for cpu and memory usage on htop
[23:37:42] <n1x4> I do have my desktop icons turned off if that's the cause?
[23:37:59] <n1x4> Really?
[23:38:07] <KaMii> same with my amd system
[23:38:21] <KaMii> and on my netbook
[23:38:38] <n1x4> Damn...
[23:38:39] <KaMii> well do a serch for tumblerd when its plugged in
[23:38:44] <n1x4> yea, all is good here
[23:38:54] <KaMii> maybe its that desktop icons then
[23:39:11] <KaMii> it just probaly constantly regenerates it
[23:39:18] <n1x4> try to disable them and see if that works... Only thing I can think of atm
[23:39:20] <KaMii> iim not sure but i saw its a xfce bug
[23:39:31] <KaMii> and its doing it on every linux distro
[23:39:44] <n1x4> Def. an xfce bug then..
[23:39:49] <KaMii> i was thinking about just... removing tumblerd
[23:39:50] <KaMii> haha
[23:39:54] <n1x4> hahah
[23:40:00] <n1x4> does it have any other deps?
[23:40:18] <KaMii> im not sure, i didnt look into it that deep
[23:40:25] <KaMii> just saw its a reported bug
[23:40:33] <KaMii> im not even sure if pat is aware of it
[23:40:41] <KaMii> i forgot to email him
[23:40:47] <n1x4> ahh
[23:41:01] <KaMii> because i think he uses kde
[23:41:07] <KaMii> so he wont even know about it
[23:41:26] <n1x4> indeed...
[23:41:36] <rworkman> We *are* aware, and I've got bugfixes for both in my pending tree
[23:41:41] <n1x4> dinner time.... pizza rolls ftw

[23:42:47] <KaMii> rworkman: ok cool!
[23:42:57] <KaMii> i wasnt sure if they even fixed it
[23:43:04] <KaMii> rworkman: what is it actually doing?
[23:43:09] <KaMii> i couldnt really figure it out
[23:43:55] <rworkman> tumblerd is opening the files and keeping them open

[23:44:14] <KaMii> so thats why im getting constant hdd input output?
[23:44:37] <KaMii> is it just constantly trying to generate those thumbnails?

[23:45:40] <rworkman> http://slackware.com/~rworkman/tumblerd/  <-- updates for a few xfce components
[23:45:57] <rworkman> Not generating, but yeah, almost surely
[23:46:09] <TommyC> rworkman: How's the house going?
[23:46:19] <rworkman> TommyC: We're in :)
[23:46:19] <KaMii> cool thanks
[23:46:28] <TommyC> well I'd hope so, lol
[23:46:34] <TommyC> but I mean like in terms of plumbing, services, etc.
[23:46:45] <KaMii> so that would explain why.. when i plugged in my MEDIA external hdd, it sucked my cpu
[23:47:03] <rworkman> TommyC: a few nits here and there, but nothing major.
[23:47:10] <TommyC> cool
[23:47:25] <TommyC> I hope you have windows in your basement otherwise Radon gas poisoning will catch up with ya.
[23:47:42] <rworkman> I've still got to get carpet down in the basement, and yes, there are windows
[23:47:52] <TommyC> neato
[23:48:24] <TommyC> well I hope you have a fantastic day in your brand new home. :)
[23:48:37] <rworkman> Thanks, much appreciated - it's a lazy one thus far :)
