[00:00:43] <Nh3xus> Alex, you can have a look at how to do embedded linux systems if you want to discover new things
[00:01:19] <Nh3xus> There's the "build root" tool for that
[00:02:53] <alex20032> Nh3xus: no, i dont have experience with all of those
[00:03:01] <alex20032> But i want to gain experience with all of those
[00:03:16] <alex20032> Later, i either want to become a low level programmer, or a *nix system administrator
[00:04:13] <Nh3xus> I see, you might try to learn how to use the assembly programming language
[00:04:21] <Guest31613> ahahah
[00:04:35] <alex20032> already doing this
[00:04:38] Nick change: mrtux -> Mrtux-Minetest
[00:04:39] <Nh3xus> great
[00:04:44] <wood_quinn> Assembly? Lol.
[00:04:45] Nick change: Mrtux-Minetest -> mrtux
[00:04:50] <Nh3xus> sup guest ubuntu guy ? how'ru doin' ?
[00:05:19] <wood_quinn> I know people tout it as a learning tool, but the average (even the average technical) person will never use assembly.
[00:05:47] <alex20032> i just found out assembly to be fun

[00:07:19] <Guest31613> what if python, java and perl didnt existed then people had to conform with just C and asm
[00:07:55] teamedward (~teambiebe@CPE-76-177-4-103.natcky.res.rr.com) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[00:09:03] <wood_quinn> Well they do exist.
[00:09:24] <alex20032> well, C and asm are my favorite language
[00:09:31] <alex20032> and i dont like python
[00:10:14] <alex20032> i alway prefer compiled language... (we have bad surprise not at runtime, but at compiling time... compiler spot error)
[00:10:19] <Guest31613> the world would be cancer free
[00:10:23] <alex20032> also, well, python is space identation
[00:10:54] <alex20032> but except that... nothing else to say against python
[00:10:57] <pink_mist> Guest31613: people would also be using php and tcl more ... and that would be horrendous
[00:11:01] <alex20032> oh yes, the foreach
[00:11:30] <alex20032> then if we shouldnt use php, what should we use, asp from m$??
[00:11:53] <pink_mist> how the heck did you get from "php sucks" to "use asp"?!
[00:12:15] <alex20032> because there are not many server side language commonly used on internet
[00:12:27] <pink_mist> alex20032: this was a hypothetical scenario anyway, since perl, java and python *do* exist
[00:12:41] <pink_mist> alex20032: you can write CGI in C
[00:12:47] <pink_mist> and assembler
[00:12:55] <alex20032> but its not often i see cgi in C
[00:12:58] <alex20032> or in assembler
[00:13:12] <pink_mist> alex20032: but if perl and python didn't exist, you'd see more of it.
[00:13:13] <alex20032> But you just made me want to assembler CGI
[00:13:29] <pink_mist> also, there's ruby still
[00:13:42] <Guest31613> and c++
[00:13:46] <alex20032> well, i rarely see CGI in perl (well, few year ago, it was common)
[00:13:54] <alex20032> i prefer ruby over python
[00:15:06] <pink_mist> alex20032: did you realize that php started out as just a templating language *for* perl? so in actuality, if we didn't have perl, we wouldn't have php either

[00:31:55] <alex20032> well, windows see hyperthreading as dual core...
[00:32:06] <KaMii> which kernel are you using?
[00:32:16] <alex20032> windows has difficult doing difference between a true core, or a logical core
[00:32:18] <KaMii> did if its not an smp kernel you will only use one core
[00:32:31] <vhzc> is Huge-SMP
[00:32:39] <vhzc> the default kernel
[00:32:55] <KaMii> well huge is more of a debugging kernel and less of a default
[00:32:57] <Guest31613> I think that the core duo line got rid of hyperthreading

[00:48:34] <vhzc> thank you to everybody that gave me some clues.
[00:49:19] <ananke> so yeah, look in the bios, under ACPI and also APIC

[01:40:04] <wood_quinn> It runs functions to sort a queue for you.
[01:40:08] <pink_mist> automatic
[01:40:23] <wood_quinn> build and sort.
[01:40:32] <wood_quinn> I think that's pretty much what dependency resolutiuon is.

[01:47:57] <pink_mist> that's always fun :P that's why the main kernel building guide tells you to install your new kernel *alongside* your old already working one, Jdogzz :P
[01:47:58] <Nh3xus> You should have kept the default kernel and your Lilo config, you were been able to recover your boot process

[01:53:37] <KaMii> i suggest starting out with a very easy cusom compile like following http://blog.tpa.me.uk/slackware-kernel-compile-guide/

[01:54:52] <Jdogzz> I had the original kernel still in lilo.conf and got a few successful compiles, but after restarting on one of them it never booted up properly, even after recompiling it from the original kernel.

[01:57:42] <Jdogzz> The original was left untouched as the guide said, and I did compile a kernel correctly a few times with differing options. But one of those tries resulted in a failed boot which would restart the computer unless I switched to the original kernel. But all kernel compiles from then on would have the same boot issue, even without adjusting the settings.
[01:58:15] <wood_quinn> Ok.
[01:58:25] <wood_quinn> Still don't see why you're booted into Mint.
[01:58:54] <Jdogzz> And using the original kernel would result in a frozen desktop when I started x, so I just reformatted until I knew more from my experiments in a vm.

[03:02:54] <xocel> alex20032, slackpkg is what people generally use to update
[03:03:12] <wood_quinn> alex20032: There probably aren't ever going to be 300 updates available of course.
[03:03:23] <alex20032> It does download and do everything automatically?
[03:03:26] <wood_quinn> This isn't a Debian-based distro.
[03:03:28] <xocel> its comes with slack. There are 3rd party alternatives also. slapt-get etc
[03:03:35] <alex20032> Well, on my Debian box, i already had over 300 update
[03:03:44] <xocel> lol!
[03:04:03] <poprocks> slackpkg is a nice tool, but rsync + pkgtools works fine too.
[03:04:06] <oscurochu> wine doesnt work. i think that is the only multilib app i have installed

[03:11:47] <alex20032> which more is more popular/most widely used/more updated...
[03:12:27] <wood_quinn> sbopkg is the original, but I've never heard any problems associated with sbotools.
[03:12:40] <wood_quinn> sbopkg doesn't do any dependency resolution.
[03:13:04] <wood_quinn> And it makes you use an ncurses interface if you want to do anything other than build or install.
[03:13:05] <xocel> alex20032, sbopkg is more used as its much older. sbotools has more functionality and is actively maintained. (will be a new update sometime this week)

[03:20:45] <xocel> then sboinstall <any args you may want> "name of application"

[03:21:27] <Demon_Fox> How would I replace all the dots in a string with spaces using sed?
[03:21:49] <Demon_Fox> Last time I tried it removed the first number each of the strings
[03:21:55] <xocel> reading the manpages for sboinstall, sboupgrade, sboremove would probably be a good idea also
[03:22:24] <poprocks> s/\./ /g
[03:22:29] <xocel> or theres the documentation: http://dawnrazor.net/sbotools/documentation/
[03:22:36] <Demon_Fox> oh I must have forgot to include the back slash
[03:22:50] <poprocks> yeah you need to escape it. Otherwise '.' is a regexp
[03:23:52] <poprocks> don't forget the '/g' either, otherwise it'll only do it for the first dot in the string (if there are more than one, the remaining ones won't be touched)
[03:24:34] <pink_mist> the worst part would be to remember the /g, but forget the \ for the .
[03:25:07] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[03:25:09] <poprocks> pink_mist: heh, yeah, then you'd wind up with a bunch of spaces in a row ;-)
[03:25:22] <wood_quinn> You'd end up wiping out the file.
[03:25:30] <Demon_Fox> for f in *mkv; do mv "$f" "$(echo $f | sed 's/ mkv/\.mkv/'"; done
[03:25:44] <poprocks> wood_quinn: you'd have a file, but it'd be nothing but whitespace ;-)
[03:25:50] <Demon_Fox> I mistakenly replaced all of them
[03:25:53] <wood_quinn> You don't need the backslash in the replacement.
[03:26:09] <Demon_Fox> To put some of the dots back
[03:26:38] <Demon_Fox> wait I found it
[03:26:39] <poprocks> wood_quinn: heh, you learn something new every day :-D

[04:42:16] <KaMii> no i use chromium, but i wouldnt want my browser to be my OS
[04:42:35] <KaMii> if i did, i would just run windows
[04:42:44] <wood_quinn> It has a web browser, webdev suite, email client, and addons!
[04:42:58] <KaMii> wood_quinn: and they are all bloated
[04:43:34] <Jdogzz> I used to use Chromium but the lack of support for NoScript pushed me to Seamonkey (I like the mail client integration).

[04:45:00] <Jdogzz> NoScript or NotScript or ScriptNo? The first one doesn't work in Chromium-based browsers as far as I know.
[04:45:05] Nick change: teamedward_ -> teamedward
[04:45:20] <Jdogzz> But it's the only one that actually blocks scripting effectively.
[04:45:28] <KaMii> notscript works just fine for me
[04:46:18] <Jdogzz> If you search for NotScript on the NoScript forums you can find a number of places that it's lacking in protecting against.

[04:47:27] <KaMii> besides, ff doenst work well with some xfce themes
[04:48:06] <KaMii> if you use the xfce-dusk appearance, then you cannot see anything you type in the address bar on ff
[04:48:14] <KaMii> it also totally make ff unuseable
[04:48:30] <KaMii> why ff is dependent on the ff theme, idk, and ff is a bloated pos
[04:50:13] <Jdogzz> I would give up aesthetically pleasing themes if it means the ability to have additional protection:) And SeaMonkey is far better with memory than Firefox (and Chromium). It may or may not work better with your theme choice as well.
[04:52:10] <Jdogzz> Both Chrome and Chromium have taken as much as 2 GB to run a half dozen or so tabs, so not my personal favorite on that alone.
[04:53:06] <KaMii> its not an asthethic its called my eyes are light sensitive and i have to have a dark theme or else it hurts to look at the monitor
[04:53:34] <KaMii> 2gb of what?
[04:53:52] <KaMii> and then you should really compile your own chromium because i dont have that issue at all
[04:54:02] <Cultist> neither do I

[04:54:27] <Jdogzz> There aren't other themes or desktop/window managers that you could use and not produce the problem?
[04:54:29] <KaMii> and chromium is lighter than seamonkey and ff
[04:54:44] <KaMii> Jdogzz: thats the only dark theme that doesnt hurt my eyes
[04:54:46] <Jdogzz> And I'm referring to RAM, it gets quite greedy  lately.
[04:55:40] <Jdogzz> I got that your eyes don't respond well to all themes, I mean using similarly dark themes/managers that don't clash with Firefox.
[04:55:59] <teamedward> if common apps didn't bloat then the memory chip makers would go out of business
[04:56:17] <Jdogzz> As to Chromium being a problem on my computer alone, I found that a lot of other people have complaints about RAM usage as well, so I think compiling it myself would fail to fix that problem.
[04:56:52] <Cultist> where do you get a precompiled chromium package for slackware anyway?

[04:58:23] <KaMii> yea... theres yoru problem
[04:58:27] <Cultist> well that could be the source of your problem
[04:58:56] <KaMii> oh, i forgot to dump my chromium slackbuild on my website...
[04:59:07] <Jdogzz> What other way is there to do it? There's no stable version of Chromium from what I remember.
[04:59:16] <KaMii> sbo
[04:59:29] <Cultist> use a slackbuild to build an up-to-date nightly
[04:59:41] <Cultist> sbo's was pretty out of date last I looked,unless the maintainer has updated it
[04:59:49] <Cultist> but the change to make it work with a current version is trivial
[05:00:47] <KaMii> thats why i made my own sbo
[05:00:53] <Jdogzz> The Slackbuild just uses an older version, at one point it was the nightly releases.
[05:00:58] <KaMii> well there are new dependencies for chromium if you use the nightly
[05:00:58] <Jdogzz> *one of the
[05:03:43] <poprocks> initially I couldn't get Chrom{e,ium} to work on my ancient computer because the builds required sse2, which my processor didn't support. When I tried to build it myself, the build would segfault every time. So I built it on my other machine, specifically without sse2 support, and it is super slow on my old computer. Much slower than Firefox.
[05:05:18] <Jdogzz> I'll have to check out if there is a dependency difference once I have Slackware installed again, I don't remember there being any dependency change.

[05:46:05] <wood_quinn> Does searching for the error message yeild any results?
[05:46:28] <Skywise> has asking in here helped at all?
[05:46:31] <wood_quinn> Sounds to me like it's expecting a password or something.

[06:24:46] <teamedward> i thought it was a viral joke
[06:25:16] <wood_quinn> Well.
[06:25:18] <wood_quinn> Anyway.
[06:25:18] <teamedward> what the VD stood for
[06:25:23] <wood_quinn> What software isn't working?
[06:25:31] <wood_quinn> (And what is?)
[06:25:44] <wood_quinn> Unless you've already nuked everything in which case never mind.
[06:26:27] <teamedward> flash player plugin in mozilla will work, mplayer locked up on me when i set the hardware manually wich is hw(0.1) on my system, before that it just wouldn't play sound
[06:26:40] <teamedward> launced mplayer from console and it fell all the way down to null
[06:26:42] <wood_quinn> Yep.
[06:26:54] <wood_quinn> MPlayer uses OSS' ALSA emulation.
[06:26:58] <wood_quinn> Flash uses ALSA.
[06:27:39] <wood_quinn> Your problem was that you were trying to access the sound hardware using two different drivers at once.
[06:27:58] <shonudo> and that always makes a funny sound
[06:28:05] <shonudo> (that only dogs can hear)
[06:28:20] <teamedward> yeah, that makes sense
[06:28:25] <wood_quinn> Now as for MPlayer "locking up" and "fell all the way down to null" I can't tell you.
[06:28:41] <KaMii> i built this gnomish sound device, makes it so you can hear the noise also
[06:29:03] <wood_quinn> Gnomish?
[06:29:14] <shonudo> i was about to ask the same thing...
[06:29:17] <wood_quinn> Like the little santas that are in people's yards?
[06:29:26] <wood_quinn> Or the gross ones from Harry Potter?
[06:29:31] <shonudo> or the thing from travelocity?
[06:29:33] <KaMii> no, like the cute gnomes on warcraft
[06:29:35] <wood_quinn> Or maybe the tinkerer's from WoW>
[06:29:40] <wood_quinn> Oh ok.
[06:30:36] <teamedward> so how the hell do i get X to use strictly OSS' ALSA or strictly ALSA?
[06:30:43] <wood_quinn> You can't.
[06:30:51] xocel (~xocel@101.98.159.174) joined ##slackware.
[06:30:57] <wood_quinn> It's a higher level decisison than that, controlled by each bit of software you use.
[06:31:12] <wood_quinn> MPlayer can be told to use ALSA by using "mplayer -ao alsa"
[06:31:34] <teamedward> which didn't work in my case, because from console, X was already using it
[06:31:40] <teamedward> does that make sense?
[06:32:15] <wood_quinn> "X" doesn't use an audio driver.
[06:32:18] <wood_quinn> Because X doesn't do audio.
[06:33:20] <shonudo> or windows
[06:33:48] <shonudo> hmmm, that had an interesting double meaning i didn't intend when i typed it
[06:34:17] <wood_quinn> shonudo: Master of profound... ness.
[06:35:17] <Demon_Fox> I wonder if Google offers such fast internet for market research?
[06:35:27] <teamedward> ok so let's start over.  I have a hardware device, HDA_something... in order to use that device, there needs to be an interface to it, which is ALSA
[06:35:31] <teamedward> is that correct so far?
[06:35:56] <wood_quinn> ALSA is a driver.
[06:37:45] <shonudo> and x is the butler/housekeeper that doesn't do audio or windows
[06:38:08] <shonudo> so, so far you have a chauffeur and a butler
[06:38:28] <teamedward> so now how do i get the hot wife and the mansion?
[06:38:52] <wood_quinn> apt-get install life

[06:52:33] <shonudo> i think it's a viable replacement for ff, but not just yet

[07:14:07] <Demon_Fox> I get completely wireless from them to me for $30 a month
[07:14:11] <wood_quinn> From what I've heard recently, about 1M times what it costs the company.
[07:14:14] <Demon_Fox> though I get like 1.5Mb/s
[07:14:34] <Skywise> and wireless is insecure
[07:14:36] <Jdogzz> I'm sad to say my parents refuse to get rid of their land line.
[07:14:42] <Jdogzz> As does my grandma.
[07:14:51] <Skywise> i still have 2 land lines
[07:14:52] <Jdogzz> "Cell phones can't be trusted."
[07:14:52] <Demon_Fox> Skywise, Short range microwave transmitters
[07:15:04] <Demon_Fox> Depends on your definition of short though
[07:15:10] <Skywise> well my land line doesn't have outages
[07:15:14] <Demon_Fox> Also it sucks in the rain for obvious reasons
[07:15:38] <Skywise> yeah, but people can still increase range by using their own high powered antenna
[07:16:02] <Demon_Fox> Lets just say they have a black box system setup.
[07:16:19] <Demon_Fox> No modifications
[07:16:58] <Skywise> and with wireless in a crowded environment with everything broadcasting at the same time, you get degraded performance for everyone
[07:17:04] <Demon_Fox> I would love if the hardware was the sole limitation to speed.
[07:17:27] <Demon_Fox> Skywise, We have only 3 companies here that use it.

[07:18:33] <Skywise> local gov't
[07:18:35] <wood_quinn> City-wide/owned.
[07:18:57] <wood_quinn> They set up large antennas and have some massive line.
[07:19:01] <Skywise> yeah, the municipality
[07:19:41] <Skywise> i don't trust gov't enough to use their services
[07:19:50] <wood_quinn> Just use Tor.
[07:19:58] <Skywise> i suspect they consided all data sent over their network to belong to them
[07:20:09] <Demon_Fox> I just don't trust their law writing abilities.
[07:20:11] <Skywise> i'd rather just wait until i got home
[07:20:36] <Demon_Fox> They just never seem to get it right
[07:21:08] <wood_quinn> If I was a city with muni wifi, I'd run the whole thing as a Tor bridge.
[07:21:57] <Skywise> if you could trust them to run it agnostically, it'd be a good thing, but i just think they'd grant themselves all sorts of privileges without your consent
[07:22:19] <wood_quinn> That's where the Tor bridge would help.
[07:22:29] <wood_quinn> You, as a provider, honestly have no idea how it's being used.
[07:22:52] <wood_quinn> But running the bridge uses bandwidth, so you could still justify the tax spending.
[07:23:05] <Skywise> yeah, but tor isn't as secure as it should be, theres still the issue with evil exit nodes
[07:23:26] <wood_quinn> The issue isn't as prevalent as you might think.
[07:23:33] <Demon_Fox> An agnostic insomniac dyslexic stays up all night wondering if there is a dog.
[07:23:54] <Skywise> how can you tell when a node is evil or not
[07:24:22] <Demon_Fox> The machine sees everything
[07:24:24] <Skywise> if there was a definitive way to avoid bad exit nodes, i'd have more confidence, but right now theres no mechanism for it
[07:24:25] <cmyster> sprinkle holly water at it ?
[07:24:32] <wood_quinn> Skywise: You can't, but the likelyhood of someone spending money running a high-capacity exit node maliciously considering the payoff is pretty low.
[07:24:38] fnord0 (~fnord0@unaffiliated/fnord0) left irc: Excess Flood
[07:24:43] <wood_quinn> Just due to high noise-to-signal ratios.
[07:24:59] <Skywise> i dunno, theres pretty low payoff in spam and yet everyone's mailbox is crammed with it

[07:25:46] <wood_quinn> And, while there isn't a way to avoid bad nodes, you can select nodes you trust and only exit from them.
[07:25:48] <Demon_Fox> Just not for fibre or wireless
[07:26:14] <wood_quinn> That obviously reduces your anonymity because now you stand out, but I'm sure it's a lot less problematic than warrants worry.
[07:26:18] zach_ (~zach@ip98-180-222-229.fv.ks.cox.net) joined ##slackware.
[07:26:23] <Skywise> its a good idea, its just hard to implement a truly trusted system
[07:26:29] <wood_quinn> Definitely.
[07:26:47] <wood_quinn> 'course if the site you're visiting uses SSL it's a moot point.
[07:27:37] <Skywise> one of the problems with xmpp protocol is you can only guaranteed encryption between client to server connections at the end points, theres no guarantee the server to server connections relaying the message will use encrypted communications
[07:27:52] <Skywise> so you can't really have a secure xmpp conversation
[07:28:02] <wood_quinn> Yeah IRC is the same way.
[07:28:27] <wood_quinn> But there are plugins for chat clients that actually add a layer of encryption, similarly to PGPing up an email.
[07:28:32] <KaMii> some monkey butt horde is stalking and killering me.... Skywise is that you?
[07:28:40] <wood_quinn> Monkey Butt?
[07:28:46] <wood_quinn> Nah that wasn't Skywise.
[07:28:50] <Demon_Fox> Don't discuss matters of national security over IRC and you should be fine
[07:28:51] <KaMii> wood_quinn:
[07:28:54] <Skywise> no, i'm never a monkey butt
[07:28:54] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[07:29:29] <Demon_Fox> You all know it is true
[07:29:38] <Skywise> well i'd rather they couldn't intercept my conversations then hope they wouldn't
[07:29:41] <Demon_Fox> Don't put anything you don't want found on the internet
[07:29:54] <Skywise> well this channel is publically logged
[07:30:01] <Demon_Fox> Don't put anything you don't want found on the internet
[07:30:09] <Skywise> but you can have other private convesations
[07:30:22] <wood_quinn> Matters of national security, things that may lead someone to believe they can sell something to you, etc.
[07:30:23] <shonudo> did someone just mention emacs, steam engines, or monkeys?
[07:30:25] <Demon_Fox> Every encryption so far has been broken with enough time.
[07:30:46] <Skywise> yes, encryption is not impervious its only ever a matter of time
[07:30:57] <Skywise> and the time gets shorter and shorter
[07:31:24] <wood_quinn> The value in encryption is making sure it doesn't get broken until after the information doesn't matter.
[07:31:38] <Skywise> yeah thats the standard the gov't uses
[07:31:45] <Jdogzz> What about quantum encryption? Doesn't the mere presence of a sniffer alter the transmission and render it useless to crack?
[07:31:55] <wood_quinn> Skywise: I thought they used "Good enough."
[07:31:58] <Jdogzz> In theory of course.
[07:32:00] <Demon_Fox> back to doctor who
[07:32:00] <Skywise> you use enough to outlast the lifetime of the value of the information
[07:32:30] <Skywise> the more long lived the information is, the stronger encryption is used

[07:57:30] <wood_quinn> I guess I should use English here.
[07:58:19] <Skywise> i suspect you ignored the beep more then it didn't happen

[08:49:03] <gnisho> Crap and crap.
[08:49:38] <Demon_Fox> The article said that South Korea has an average of 200 times faster internet speed for around the same price we pay here.
[08:50:04] <Skaperen> Demon_Fox: "The average American that has crappy internet (which is just about everyone) pays on average $40 a month" ... there, fixed it for you
[08:50:25] <Demon_Fox> Use the square brackets
[08:50:33] <gnisho> Most places in the US you get an effective monopoly or duopoly.   Cable co. vs. Telco.  Telco means DSL, and not always fast DSL.  Cable Co varies a *lot* from one city to the next.
[08:50:37] <Skaperen> of course Korean ISPs only need to deliver that speed over 1/5 the distance
[08:50:38] <Demon_Fox> It is what you are supposed to use for insertion.
[08:50:59] <Demon_Fox> Maybe an oligopoly
[08:51:30] <Skaperen> check what speeds are available in Kansas City, Chattanooga, and compare to Stockholm

[09:04:44] <gnisho> To be fair, in my informal survey of Random People I Know in This Area, DSL users tend to have more problems with line quality and weather than cable users do.
[09:04:59] <KaMii> and squirrels
[09:05:41] <Skaperen> gnisho: that's because part of the transmission is baseband, and the hum from wrong grounding can interrupt it
[09:05:45] <Demon_Fox> I would love to see an internet company that throttled based solely on hardware limitations.

[09:08:30] <Demon_Fox> KaMii, Has anyone ever told you that you are an interesting person to talk to?
[09:08:48] <Demon_Fox> You know much
[09:09:26] <KaMii> yes i have heard that before
[09:10:14] <KaMii> but mot people usually hate me after awhile

[09:21:24] <Demon_Fox> Like if they say it is valuable but you don't think it is
[09:21:35] <Demon_Fox> then usually a safe bet not to trust them.
[09:21:59] <Demon_Fox> Also internet companies that undermine the definition of maximum.
[09:22:55] <Demon_Fox> Perhaps they could use it like
[09:23:07] <Demon_Fox> Residential maximum speed
[09:23:21] <Demon_Fox> and for the fastest absolute maximum speed
[09:23:30] <Demon_Fox> And that be the fastest speed they offer.
[09:23:54] <wood_quinn> With the infrastructure available technologically, I wish the distinction between residential and business connections was removed.
[09:24:09] <Demon_Fox> That would be nice, but
[09:24:22] <KaMii> its just a way to get them moar money

[12:53:25] <Townsend> Yeah haha
[12:53:38] <Townsend> I akso went to #mandrake
[12:53:54] <Townsend> Nh3xus: What is used for package managment?
[12:55:07] <Townsend> Didn't linus himself start this Distro?
[12:56:42] <KaMii> pkgtools
[12:57:20] <Townsend> Okay he didn't start it but he worked on it in the early days?
[12:57:34] <core_saint> what is going on here?
[12:57:41] <KaMii> another troll
[12:57:43] <Townsend> pkgtools is prebuilt bins or source based?
[12:57:49] <Townsend> I am not a troll
[12:58:14] <Townsend> I was just curious, haven't even thought about this distro in years
[12:58:23] <Townsend> Good to see it is still around is all.
[12:58:26] <KaMii> kgtool  is  a menu-driven package maintenance tool
[12:58:35] <KaMii> man pkgtool
[12:58:42] <KaMii> it tells you everything you need to know
[12:59:10] <Nh3xus> Yup, and you can add third party software by searching them on slackbuilds.org
[12:59:28] <core_saint> use sbopkg
[12:59:32] <core_saint> it is easier
[12:59:37] <Townsend> Yea cause I can man something that isnt on my system or in my documentation.
[12:59:49] <KaMii> ever hear of google?
[12:59:57] <KaMii> manpages are all over the internet
[12:59:57] <Townsend> I just wanted to know if your package managment was source based or not..
[13:00:02] <Nh3xus> Just keep in mind that by default, Slackware doesn't check dependencies
[13:00:15] <Townsend> KaMii: You said to man it, who is the troll again?
[13:00:28] <Townsend> Nh3xus: So it is broken. Awesome.
[13:00:36] <KaMii> rtfm, if you havent heard that before, welcome to irc
[13:00:46] <KaMii> its not broken
[13:00:59] <Nh3xus> A good start is to read the Slackbook
[13:01:06] <Townsend> KaMii: No you said to man pkgtool, not googlr it or rtfm. You are retarded.
[13:01:17] <Nh3xus> Hey calm down
[13:01:20] <KaMii> the philosophy is, the user/administrator of your slackware machine is the dependency checker
[13:01:32] <KaMii> trolololololo
[13:01:42] <Nh3xus> Yup, this imply that you know what you're doin'
[13:01:51] <Townsend> Oh no I use a real distro, that just does dependency managment out of the box, since there is no reason any distro should not be setup that way.
[13:02:10] <KaMii> more like, slackware doesnt mindlessly install packages for you
[13:02:28] <KaMii> wow, so slackware isnt a real distro?
[13:02:29] <Townsend> Yeah makes sense to waste hours hand checking dependencies for absolutely no gain.

[13:02:38] <KaMii> hours?
[13:02:45] <Nh3xus> A good reason is that you will be able to troubleshoot your system very easily with Slack when it's harder on other distros
[13:02:49] <KaMii> i have never spent hours

[13:03:41] <KaMii> then why come in here to troll us?
[13:03:43] <Townsend> Forcing users to manage dependencies manually does nothing for a new user.
[13:03:55] <KaMii> then dont use slackware
[13:04:00] <KaMii> we really dont care
[13:04:02] <Nh3xus> Yeah why trolling here ?
[13:04:09] <Townsend> I didn't come here to troll, came to BS about the distro and you guys got all defensive and stupid.
[13:04:14] <KaMii> he was in here a few days ago, some guy from ubuntu
[13:04:19] <core_saint> Townsend, nobody is forcing you to use it
[13:04:36] <Nh3xus> You wanna troll ? Go to #ubuntu and yell that Ubuntu is now a fuckin' spyware and that RMS agree with that
[13:04:37] <Townsend> KaMii: No, I wasn't. I do not use Ubuntu.
[13:04:49] <KaMii> i never said you use it
[13:04:55] <Townsend> core_saint: No one is talking about me using it.
[13:05:06] <Townsend> 04:57 < KaMii> he was in here a few days ago, some guy from ubuntu
[13:05:09] <Townsend> Ya you did.
[13:05:15] <KaMii> kinda early in the morning for a troll to be out
[13:05:23] <KaMii> from ubuntu, meaing the channel
[13:05:28] <KaMii> ffs, go away
[13:05:36] <Townsend> Why would I be in that channel?
[13:05:38] <Nh3xus> They tend to annoy during the evening but heh, times change
[13:05:43] <core_saint> this is the way distro is made and if you don't like it go look for something that will work better for you
[13:05:55] <Townsend> I was an Ubuntu Dev in the early says, pre cannocal.
[13:05:58] <KaMii> or fork it to your own personal needs
[13:06:04] <Townsend> Cannoical*
[13:06:07] <KaMii> mr. 'i build LFS system'
[13:06:15] <Nh3xus> So, an 'buntu dev is prone to trollin'
[13:06:20] <Townsend> I do, and am using one now.
[13:06:23] <Nh3xus> man you just lost your credibility there
[13:06:40] <Townsend> And guess what, it does package managment with dependency resolution.
[13:06:41] <KaMii> if I had a dollar for every person that claimed to be a 'insert-distro' dev, i would be rich
[13:07:03] <KaMii> Townsend: who gives a rats ass
[13:07:10] <fuzzix> I'm a fuzzix dev, going on 10 years. It's not finished yet.
[13:07:13] <Nh3xus> and guess what it's able to break your system down as well
[13:07:16] <Townsend> KaMii: Claim? Want to see my contribs to Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Arch and many others?
[13:07:28] <KaMii> im sure if you *were* a dev, you would have better things to do thatn troll ##slackware
[13:07:34] <Townsend> Nh3xus: No it isn't/
[13:07:53] <KaMii> lol fuzzix
[13:07:54] <Nh3xus> so if you was an Ubuntu dev' let me tell to you that PulseAudio is a piece of crap
[13:08:17] <KaMii> he *was* a dev, meaning hes a pos that sucks so they kicked him off the team for trolling the forum
[13:08:19] <Townsend> Yes cause I am trolling, obviously. You guys are defensive because you know manually managing package depends became useless in about 2002.
[13:08:36] <KaMii> lmfao
[13:08:57] <KaMii> Townsend: do you see any of us in other distro channels bitching about their distro?
[13:09:03] <Townsend> And that there is absolutely no upside to it.
[13:09:04] <Nh3xus> What doesn't fit your needs doesn't mean that it's also the case for someone else
[13:09:22] <Nh3xus> be broadminded man...
[13:09:31] <Townsend> Even Gentoo's portage does dependency managment.
[13:09:44] <Townsend> Oh I am.
[13:09:51] <KaMii> his lack of intelligence only prooves he never developed anything
[13:10:05] <Nh3xus> So, you want to praise for your lovely distro ? I dunno who cares here
[13:10:10] <wed> There are so mindboggingly few deps in Slack to track. So there is no point
[13:10:17] <KaMii> he requires praise from ##slackware
[13:10:32] <Townsend> Yea, clearly I have a huge lack of intelligence. Since you guys are the ones defending a distro that doesnt even have dependency managment.
[13:10:32] <KaMii> why?  because secretly he knows we are all gods and goddesses
[13:11:01] <KaMii> so, tell me again, why are you in here?  what is the intelligent reason?
[13:11:10] <Nh3xus> Hey Townsend, what about that fuckin' Amazon crap that the AWESOME Ubuntu dev's added to that distro ?
[13:11:19] <Nh3xus> They disrespect their users
[13:11:37] <Townsend> I could give 2 shits about what Ubuntu does.

[13:12:23] <Townsend> Twice actually.
[13:12:45] <KaMii> your intelligent reason to be in here is to BS?
[13:12:47] <Nh3xus> I think we're lost in your troll attempt....
[13:12:49] <Townsend> And if your community is so big and strong, and if I am such a big troll, why have I not been booted?
[13:12:49] <KaMii> and you are not a troll?
[13:12:49] <Nh3xus> Still...
[13:13:04] <KaMii> we sure have had some stupid trolls lately
[13:13:24] <KaMii> why should we boot you?
[13:13:29] <KaMii> we are not little dictators
[13:13:34] <Townsend> I am a troll for making valid points and being attacked by insecure defensive know-nothing half-wits?

[13:17:48] <KaMii> grow up dude
[13:17:49] <Nh3xus> If a distro like Slack is still maintained nowadays, well it proves how powerful and reliable it is. Nuff said
[13:18:01] <Townsend> You were the one attempting a point, I rebutted. Is English new for you?
[13:18:39] <KaMii> attempting a point?  i asked if you would be mildly amusing or comical at trolling

[13:19:27] <Nh3xus> Townsend: Well it's a valid statement when it comes to Linux distros
[13:19:32] <Cultist> Would people continue to use it if it were bad and there were good alternatives?
[13:19:34] <Townsend> KaMii: Obviously that was not the comment I was referring to, if you can't even carry a conversation please don't attempt to use a language you don't fully understand.

[13:20:12] <KaMii> okej d, vi kan snaka svenska istllet

[13:36:34] <KaMii> i can quote an arbitrary statement in a foreign language also
[13:36:57] <Townsend> It is directly related to the the topic of Sweeden.
[13:36:59] <pink_mist> Townsend: so basically you're just copy/pasting stuff from websites. How fun.
[13:37:00] <pi31415> kamii: one not related to ordering food?
[13:37:05] <KaMii> yes, not difficult to copy and paste
[13:37:11] <Cultist> Townsend, I don't think Sweden was the topic
[13:37:14] <Townsend> So is that quote, so no, not arbitrary at all.
[13:37:15] <wed> A few grammatical errors there
[13:37:26] <Townsend> Then again you probably don't even understand that word.

[13:39:15] <Townsend> wed: It is the exact way he wrote it, go read fro a source.
[13:39:17] <Cultist> Usually when you try to convince someone that you speak a language, you type something in it

[14:00:26] <KaMii> im impressed by people that know how to use google translate
[14:00:27] <Cultist> Townsend, something that I've noticed is that there is a disproportionately large number of Slackware users who come from Sweden.
[14:00:39] <Cultist> might want to keep that in mind
[14:00:54] <d4wnr4z0r> obviously swedish people are more intelligent than other people.
[14:01:02] <Cultist> when trying to tell Swedes that they can't speak Swedish.
[14:01:07] <Nh3xus> duden now he can't trick us anymore
[14:01:13] <pi31415> d4wnr4z0r, that, or they're just goofballs
[14:01:14] <core_saint> Nh3xus, it seems like most distro is making the switch for systemd

[14:01:40] <KaMii> or russian
[14:01:41] <d4wnr4z0r> pi31415: could be. I wouldn't know, I'm just pulling random statements out of thin air.
[14:01:53] <KaMii> or klingon
[14:02:00] <Nh3xus> debian hasn't made the switch to systemd right ?

[14:05:36] <d4wnr4z0r> I really don't think there's much threat of that, KaMii
[14:05:39] <KaMii> lmfao
[14:05:46] <core_saint> d4wnr4z0r, i used it for a few weeks and it didn't seem so bad
[14:05:47] <pi31415> kamii, i agree.  my main objection to systemd is that you apparently need to print a 200 page manual to understand it.
[14:06:07] <d4wnr4z0r> core_saint: it's not, as long as you don't try to do anything with it
[14:06:10] <KaMii> but its better, apparently
[14:06:18] <Townsend> pi31415: Yes it is very hard to know how to do systemctl enable [UNIT]
[14:06:30] <pi31415> i heard someone use a term once, "overengineered"
[14:06:30] <KaMii> and.. linus is no longer finnish hes swedish
[14:06:34] <Townsend> Thats the entire syntax for anything you need to know.
[14:06:37] <core_saint> d4wnr4z0r, what do you think of openSuse?
[14:06:42] <d4wnr4z0r> core_saint: the more one tries to do things with it, the worse it gets. highly admin-hostile, symlink pools everywhere, very poorly-maintained packages, broken package system, etc
[14:07:01] <pi31415> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering
[14:07:17] <Townsend> d4wnr4z0r: Where do you read this? It is EASIER to use than rc.cong and more stable. No one debates that.
[14:07:28] <Townsend> conf*
[14:07:31] <d4wnr4z0r> core_saint: I don't, much. it used to be a nice desktop distro, but realistically, I'd choose an RH-family distro over suse

[14:10:03] <Cultist> I've occasionally installed other distros to play with like CentOS or Debian, always end up back at Slackware

[14:13:12] <core_saint> d4wnr4z0r, i did have slackware installed on my laptop but i really dislike kde lately
[14:13:12] <d4wnr4z0r> unless you have a crush on hannah montana, of course
[14:13:21] <KaMii> pi31415: because you spend a lot of time messing with a ton of gnu and not so much time messing with the kernel
[14:13:26] <core_saint> and xfce... well compiz issues
[14:13:28] <pi31415> i dunno booboo, guess we'll just leave systemd out for today
[14:13:40] <d4wnr4z0r> why do you need compiz with xfce?
[14:13:49] <core_saint> well i dont
[14:13:52] <core_saint> really
[14:13:56] <pi31415> kamii, that makes sense now
[14:14:03] <core_saint> just tried to play around with it
[14:14:07] <core_saint> and i failed
[14:14:08] <d4wnr4z0r> xfce has a pretty decent compositor built-in
[14:14:16] <d4wnr4z0r> shadows, transparency, all that jazz

[14:14:26] <Nh3xus> i'm amazed by this setup
[14:14:26] <KaMii> core_saint: if you want a bloated WM just use KDE
[14:14:41] <core_saint> i dont like kde
[14:14:44] <KaMii> i cant stand compiz
[14:14:58] <KaMii> i dont need wobbly windows
[14:15:07] <core_saint> i might go back to slackware after trying out some other distros
[14:15:09] <d4wnr4z0r> they are pretty awful
[14:15:22] <Nh3xus> KaMii what about the damn cube ?
[14:15:30] <d4wnr4z0r> of all the things a window should do, at no time does wobbling seem like one of them
[14:15:37] <d4wnr4z0r> that cube is pretty bad too.
[14:15:42] <core_saint> true
[14:15:52] <core_saint> cube sucks
[14:16:02] <KaMii> the cube is retarded
[14:16:03] <Nh3xus> i prefer circles

[14:16:12] <KaMii> i just prefer no animation
[14:16:15] <d4wnr4z0r> I like the sliding when changing desktops. though on some systems I turn even that off.

[14:16:39] <wed> I don't mind the candy, as long as it is out of the way when I do production stuff
[14:16:55] <core_saint> mephisto_, how long will it take to compile whole system??? maybe sabayon?
[14:17:18] <mephisto_> you are right about portage, but you'll be fine as long as you actually *read* the docs
[14:17:19] <wed> But most of all, I want to put my clock cycles to good use
[14:17:25] <KaMii> yea... i dont see the point of compiz
[14:17:44] <mephisto_> it depends, compiling KDE is an adventure but getting started with a minimal system is pretty easy
[14:18:10] <KaMii> i tried gentoo, hated it
[14:18:10] <core_saint> true i guess compiz is a fancy gimmick
[14:18:14] <KaMii> that portage crap
[14:18:29] <d4wnr4z0r> I gave gentoo a good go last year (first time in a decade) thinking, "I love FreeBSD and ports". didn't last long.
[14:18:46] <wed> Gentoo provided me with a good stepping stone into Linux
[14:18:48] <KaMii> same here, portage killed it for me
[14:18:49] <d4wnr4z0r> granted, it was nice not doing a stage 1 install. but it was still painful.
[14:18:55] <Nh3xus> Well such eye candy does appeal new users to GNU/Linux
[14:18:56] <core_saint> i just need ready to go system for school... java programing and such that would run nicely on laptop.... and

[14:19:47] <core_saint> but just was looking at some other options.... like opensuse
[14:19:50] <KaMii> slackware works for me, so i use it
[14:19:56] <mephisto_> yeah Im using slackware and don't plan to give up on it anytime soon, very simple and rock stable distro
[14:20:22] <KaMii> pink_mist: dont let him get to you, hes a pos troll that used google translate
[14:20:37] <Nh3xus> The best tool is the one you are comfortable with

[14:21:41] <KaMii> i agree, you never say that kinda stuff
[14:21:49] <Nh3xus> yeah a child on meth
[14:21:52] <mephisto_> to each his own, personally, I've tried buntu, fedora, slack, centos, opensuse I settled with slackware and gentoo
[14:22:07] <KaMii> people like him are why im all for abortion, and hes just another failed abortion attempt
[14:22:33] <KaMii> that coat hanger in the alley is not the best way to try to get an abortion
[14:23:06] <d4wnr4z0r> it does often work, though, apparently.

[15:02:27] <KaMii> well nothing eliminates carbon

[15:02:47] <KaMii> or decomposed
[15:02:52] <xocel> TheM4ch1n3, you are correct. plants roots require oxygen, they absorb it during the plants night cycle. but the amount the release during the day far exceeds it.

[15:13:00] <KaMii> everytime i try to learn to program, i fail at it, so i just gave it up
[15:13:19] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: and what would you propose those machines had installed, to 'care about people's future'?
[15:13:20] <KaMii> its not my strenght so why try to force it to be one?
[15:14:27] <TheM4ch1n3> ananke: something that doesn't chugg so much CPU power on a cluster at a high school, that has very poor design to it
[15:14:40] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: set your ideology aside, and apply some critical thinking. knowing what OS would be most beneficial for majority to learn?
[15:14:47] Action: TheM4ch1n3 means, anything else

[15:15:03] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: what 'cluster' are you talking about?
[15:15:10] <TheM4ch1n3> ananke: well I would say linux
[15:15:24] Action: TheM4ch1n3 calls more than five PC's a cluster
[15:15:24] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: and how would knowing linux be beneficial for _majority_ of people?
[15:15:26] <xocel> KaMii, its not for everyone, but i was always that way inclined, math, physics etc.
[15:15:35] <Nh3xus> I dunno what's Linux all about. Are you talking about GNU/Linux ?
[15:15:40] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: a computer lab of workstations is not a cluster
[15:15:54] <KaMii> xocel: im just sayin the majority of people never use algerbra, so why force it?
[15:16:03] <TheM4ch1n3> ananke: have you ever seen the electric bill for one ?
[15:16:16] <xocel> because its logic.
[15:16:42] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: again, what does that have to do with computer labs in high schools? [and yes, i actually do calculations on how much our clusters use]
[15:16:44] <TheM4ch1n3> ananke: well it would be beneficial, when someone who is good with PC's looks for a job
[15:16:50] sftp (~sftp@79.174.49.44) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[15:17:21] <XGizzmo> the majority of people use algebra and never know it.
[15:17:21] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: that's not 'majority' of people. that's a small fraction of people. you're playing up to a selected few
[15:17:37] <TheM4ch1n3> ananke: oh, well I am just saying that most schools (high schools) don't have a cluster setup, but do have like 30+ windows PC's on a network
[15:17:45] <KaMii> XGizzmo: maybe
[15:17:50] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: by the same logic, you could teach esperanto, because a few people 'could use it'
[15:18:06] <xocel> just the ability to be able to rearrange formulas allows somewhat to tackle a much wider range of problems.
[15:18:09] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: PCs on a network are not a cluster. so again, why even talk about clusters?
[15:18:11] <KaMii> just the way they teach it, they are not teaching logic, they are just wanting you to do problems and never really tell you why
[15:18:12] <xocel> someone*
[15:18:15] <KaMii> so its, lost
[15:18:35] <TheM4ch1n3> ananke: well, I am just saying it teaches people the value of 'waste'
[15:19:00] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: what waste? wtf do clusters have to do with operating systems on computers in high school labs?
[15:19:01] <TheM4ch1n3> witch is a negative
[15:19:03] <xocel> oh, i completely agree with you there lol. they teach it horribly

[15:20:12] <KaMii> so i guess i won
[15:20:17] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: i'm not convinced that you even know what point you're arguing
[15:20:33] <TheM4ch1n3> ananke: I am so grumpy about the subject because here in Gauteng - South Africa, FUD is living strong, and there is nothing I can do about it
[15:20:45] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: what FUD? wtf are you talking about?
[15:21:10] <TheM4ch1n3> ananke: here, if you are smart with PC's, people hate you.
[15:21:34] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: so what does that have to do with windows on computers in labs?
[15:21:40] <TheM4ch1n3> allot
[15:22:00] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: what exactly? saying 'a lot' doesn't mean anything
[15:22:02] <TheM4ch1n3> I would not call the computer classes here, 'labs'
[15:22:27] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: i refer to labs as physical locations populated with equipment
[15:23:21] <TheM4ch1n3> but it is true, its not really the problem of windows, because the fud living here, seams to be perpetual
[15:23:45] <ananke> TheM4ch1n3: you're not making any sense
[15:24:09] <TheM4ch1n3> um, ok, simply put, there is allot of anti-trust here

[19:17:19] <teamedward> linus has a lot of fire in him
[19:17:45] <teamedward> did you see his response in the kernel mailing list to a kernel maintainer
[19:17:49] <teamedward> when he broke userspace
[19:18:54] <TheM4ch1n3> well, braking userspace is a big deal

[19:23:52] <wood_quinn> Yeah I think he kind of went over the top, not that I disagree with the "take responsibility" attitude.
[19:23:53] <Skywise> i dunno, that sort of crap has never happened before, i think the maintainer was too arrogant
[19:24:03] <Skaperen> I think the rule should be: don't break userspace
[19:24:23] <Skywise> don't break userspace then blame it on userspace
[19:24:35] <Sandman1> There is a rule that says Do not break userspace
[19:25:28] <Skaperen> so how was userspace broken?
[19:25:49] <adaptr> by a user, obviously
[19:25:59] <Skywise> changing datatype
[19:26:02] <Skaperen> users are such trouble
[19:26:24] <wood_quinn> Personally, I admire the guy he was yelling at for being able to respond that well.
[19:26:30] <Skywise> but i don't think any other maintainer will cross that line
[19:26:35] <Sandman1> I agree wood_quinn
[19:26:36] <wood_quinn> If someone chewed me like that, I'd be gone.
[19:26:53] <Skaperen> where's the line?  I'd like to peek over the edge a bit
[19:26:53] <Skywise> i think he earned that chewing out
[19:26:55] <wood_quinn> Even paying my bills wouldn't probably keep be around, and I doubt that guy's getting hack.
[19:26:57] <wood_quinn> jack.
[19:27:38] <Skywise> i don't think linus would miss anyone who did something like that
[19:27:44] <Skaperen> so I take it that what he did wasn't classifiable as "a little bug"
[19:28:10] <Skaperen> but rather was intentional ... "users ... take THAT"
[19:28:36] <Skaperen> or ... if ( is_user() ) break;
[19:28:48] <wood_quinn> I don't see any reason to lose it on someone.
[19:29:12] <Skaperen> well, at least not in public, unless you need to send a message to other maintainers
[19:29:21] <wood_quinn> It's on revision control, just revert and revoke if you've got that much of a problem.
[19:30:18] <wood_quinn> You don't have to be hostile to say "It's a kernel problem, you introduced it, and if you fark up userspace again and blame it on the software you can develop the software instead of the kernel."
[19:31:01] <Skywise> http://developers.slashdot.org/story/12/12/29/018234/linus-chews-up-kernel-maintainer-for-introducing-userspace-bug
[19:31:08] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[19:31:23] <Skaperen> wood_quinn: that's an excellent response ... you are a genius ... we're giving you maintainer status for helloworld.c
[19:31:42] <wood_quinn> I oughtta respond "WHY SO SERIOUSSS?!"?
[19:32:15] <Skywise> The patch uses the -ENOENT error code internally in the uvcvideo driver to
[19:32:15] <Skywise> inform the caller function (internal to the driver) that the requested control
[19:32:15] <Skywise> doesn't exist. It was never meant to be returned out of the driver, and
[19:32:15] <Skywise> definitely not to userspace. This is clearly a bug.

[19:34:42] <wood_quinn> And that Pat is Swedish and Finnish.
[19:34:42] <alex20032> And insulted slackware
[19:34:48] <wood_quinn> Oh yes, and that
[19:34:51] <alex20032> because it dosent have dep resolving
[19:34:57] <pink_mist> and told me (in swedish) that he wished my mother would get sick and die =(
[19:34:58] <Skywise> oh my
[19:35:01] <wood_quinn> Because of him I'm not using Slackware anymore.
[19:35:02] <pink_mist> I really took offense to that
[19:35:09] <Skaperen> there's nothing wrong with being Swedish or Finnish or even being both
[19:35:21] <wood_quinn> I never noticed that it didn't have dependency resolution before.
[19:35:24] <Skywise> we should take away his fondue pot
[19:35:28] <alex20032> wood_quinn: why you are not using slackware?
[19:35:37] <wood_quinn> I'm just disappointed that no one told me.
[19:35:55] <Sandman1> I perfer to do the hard work myself, now for a server I like my debian
[19:35:58] <wood_quinn> I started using Slackware thinking it had dependency resoluition, and for three years I've been kept in the dark.
[19:36:04] <Sandman1> But on my media pc ( hooked up to PC) It is slackware
[19:36:05] <Skywise> someone posted that linus is part of the swedish speaking minority of finland
[19:36:08] <wood_quinn> Now Townsend has shown me the light.
[19:36:18] <alex20032> are you joking?
[19:36:19] <Sandman1> wood_quinn, It is kind of easy to guess that it does not have dep resolving

[19:48:52] <Skywise> well you didn't need to get tricked into the apple II, it was a good platform
[19:48:54] <Skaperen> if it's from BSD it's not stealing

[20:34:30] <ananke> what's annoying is that while consumer electronics are getting cheaper and better, they don't always make it into other areas. for example smart thermostats. it's almost impossible to find one that does it all, and costs less than $200

[22:35:50] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Then why's it called screen? Mind=blown
[22:35:55] <wood_quinn> Lol
[22:36:33] <Urchlay> blown = inflated? (like a balloon?)
[22:36:49] <wood_quinn> Is there a way to limit the disc activity processes can... do?
[22:37:19] <wood_quinn> I have an application that uses so much of the disk I can't do anything else, and it does it frequently.
[22:37:36] <Nh3xus> wood : do you have an ssd ?
[22:37:55] <j999> :)
[22:38:29] <Nh3xus> You can reduce I/O on your disk by tweaking the commit value
[22:38:48] <wood_quinn> Personally I think that should be a kernel default.
[22:39:07] <wood_quinn> If a process is using 100% of your disc's I/O capactity, it's doing something wrong.
[22:39:09] <ananke> 'ionice'
[22:39:16] <wood_quinn> ananke: Thanks.
[22:39:29] <Urchlay> j999: OK, I'm trying the vsplit patch to screen, see if it works for me
[22:39:32] nightTrain (~textual@unaffiliated/ridout) joined ##slackware.
[22:39:37] <mad_enz> why would u want the defualt to limit I/O to disk when storage media are so slow in comparison
[22:39:45] <ananke> if nothing else is using that storage, why not let the process use it?
[22:40:08] <Nh3xus> you can also use the noatime parameter for your fstab config file
[22:40:14] <ananke> kernel will arbitrate between processes trying to use storage
[22:40:57] <wood_quinn> "If nothing else is using it" is a terrible attitude.
[22:41:22] <ananke> wood_quinn: you haven't been around computing much, have you?
[22:41:44] <wood_quinn> We reserve space for log files and such, why not reserve 3% of the I/O so I can change to a different freakin' workspace while some app is going postal.
[22:41:59] <ananke> because capacity and rate are two different things
[22:42:10] wbooze (~wbooze@xdsl-78-35-159-160.netcologne.de) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[22:42:16] <mad_enz> wood_quinn: what app is chewing up ur I/O
[22:42:22] <wood_quinn> They're both things that, once full, leave you unable to do anything, period.
[22:42:53] <ananke> wood_quinn: not at all. it's trivial for the kernel to change priorities and throttle bandwidth. it's not trivial to arbitrarily remove data
[22:42:58] <wood_quinn> Or rather, to be pendantic, lack of capacity still lets you do things and lack of available bandwidth does not.

[22:43:18] <wood_quinn> mad_enz: Our Dear and Glorious Time Waster Minecraft.
[22:43:45] <wood_quinn> The sound system has some real problems loading/unloading sounds and I don't really know why.
[22:44:03] <ananke> wood_quinn: uhmm, you clearly did not notice the obvious 'if nothing else is using it'. when another process comes around that needs I/O [network/storage], kernel begins to arbitrate
[22:44:09] <Nh3xus> Minecraft uses the Java ressource hog so.... not a big surprise
[22:44:10] <wood_quinn> They ship their own version of openal, and I oughtta just try popping up-to-date libraries in there.
[22:44:13] <ananke> that one process will not hog bandwidth
[22:44:18] <Urchlay> j999: the patch applies and the resulting screen does have the V (vertical split) option in its Help screen. And pressing ^AV does *something*
[22:44:53] <wood_quinn> ananke: My point is that the arbitration fails in this case, and my solution would both cause no problems and allow it to succeed.
[22:45:00] <j999> I used ^aV
[22:45:04] <wood_quinn> It's a buffer between "high use" and "you're screwed."
[22:45:07] <Urchlay> yeah, same thing
[22:45:21] <wood_quinn> Who vertical split what?
[22:45:26] <wood_quinn> tmux :D
[22:45:37] <Schism-> or splitvt
[22:45:41] <j999> Thanks
[22:45:44] <wood_quinn> Oh yeah or that.
[22:45:52] <Urchlay> Schism-: see discussion of splitvt above (you're late to the party)
[22:45:54] <j999> I jhave to spend some time playing with it
[22:45:54] <ananke> wood_quinn: your solution would add a very unnecessary level of complexity
[22:46:00] <wood_quinn> ananke: Fair enough.

[22:46:24] <wood_quinn> j999: Would you like me to paste you the output :)
[22:46:38] <Urchlay> ^A tab?
[22:46:40] <wood_quinn> ^A ^A
[22:47:01] <Urchlay> no
[22:47:08] <Urchlay> that switches windows
[22:47:08] <wood_quinn> Oh splits.
[22:47:19] <Urchlay> splits are apparently called "Regions" and are different
[22:47:23] <j999> please
[22:47:27] <Urchlay> j999: hey, it's working, actually
[22:47:36] <j999> It's not in my help screen
[22:47:45] <Urchlay> except the right-hand horizontal region doesn't have any command running in it
[22:47:58] <Urchlay> not in your help screen? describe what exactly you did?
[22:48:04] <j999> create a new screen
[22:48:11] <Urchlay> no, I mean, to apply the patch
[22:48:11] <j999> CTRL A CTRL C
[22:48:37] <wood_quinn> I used to use a horizontal split and put IRC on the bottom and a general purpose terminal on top, or vice versa depending on which I was paying more attention to.
[22:48:37] <ananke> wood_quinn: you need to realize that when it comes to storage bandwidth, there is no clear cut '3% of bandwidth'. to artificially limit i/o by some number, you'd have to have some very reliable source of information on how much bandwidth is available. with disk controllers that cache data, you no longer have only one number for bandwidth
[22:48:57] <j999> I got the source tarball, upoacked it, patched it, and ran slackbuild
[22:48:59] <wood_quinn> ananke: Not to mention most people don't have cruddy slow PATA drives :)

[22:49:38] <Urchlay> did you tar up your patched source tarball, to replace the one that came with the slackbuild?
[22:50:08] <Urchlay> because, the slackbuild extracts the tarball... so unless you modified the tarball, it un-did your work.
[22:50:14] <j999> yeah, sorry, I retarred :) the source folder before running the slackbuild
[22:50:27] <Urchlay> the normal way to do it: add the patch command *to* the slackbuild (there's already one in there to look at, as an example).
[22:51:03] hiptobecubic (~john@unaffiliated/hiptobecubic) left irc: Quit: 00 PC LOAD LETTER
[22:51:24] <Urchlay> I just added this line, below the existing "zcat blahblah | patch" line:

[22:51:29] <j999> I saw that, actually I tried it, but something didn't go right. I'll retry it to see if I get the same result
[22:51:43] <j999> exactly,
[22:51:53] <Urchlay> ..and place the patch bz2 in the same dir as the slackbuild itself
[22:52:39] <j999> Hey thanks! I will retry it in a just a sec.
[22:53:08] <Urchlay> well, it works. I don't know how to use it... I press ^AV and get a side-by-size split... ^A Tab switches between them. If I hit ^A? (the help command) while in the blank split region on the right, I get the help screen on the right (with my shell on the left, still)
[22:53:18] FDCX_ (~fdcx@86.126.22.186) left irc: Read error: Operation timed out
[22:53:24] <Urchlay> so it's definitely splitting, I just don't know how to start a shell in the right-hand region
[22:53:49] <j999> CTRL a CTRL a to swithch brtween current and last screen
[22:54:25] <j999> CTRL a n to got to next screen, or instead of n use a number and directly to that screen
[22:54:39] <Urchlay> ok, ^A^A and now I have the same shell on both sides, neat. "ls" on the right, and the output appears in both columns :)
[22:54:56] <Urchlay> I'd refer to side-by-side as "horizontal split", but the patch calls it "vertical". Ah well.
[22:55:11] <Urchlay> ah, OK, ^Ac to create a new shell in the current region
[22:56:00] <j999> yeah
[22:56:55] estranho (~estranho@unaffiliated/estranho) left irc: Quit: leaving
[22:57:32] <Urchlay> is there no way to get it to draw a border between the regions? right now they touch each other...
[22:57:42] <j999> you still use most of your bash shortcuts ^a beginning of line, ^e end of line, but you have to ^aa ^ae to get them to work in screen
[22:58:08] <Urchlay> yeah, that much I'm familiar with. I've used screen a little, but never used its split feature
[22:58:24] <j999> I don't know, I have recently started to use it

[22:59:15] <Urchlay> honestly screen's not much use, locally. With X running, I have virtual desktops and lots of xterms. Without X running, I have plenty of virtual consoles already.
[22:59:20] <wbooze> C-A c C-A s ?
[23:00:07] <Urchlay> the only thing I use screen for is logging in remotely, from something dumb (a real terminal, back when I used to use those, or putty if I were forced to use windows for some reason)
[23:01:14] <Urchlay> hm, trying to do vert and horiz split at the same time, sort-of works
[23:02:06] <mad_enz> anyone here ever tried shrinking a ext3/4 filesystem over 10TB?
[23:02:07] <Urchlay> actually it does work, except the border-bar is drawn incorrectly to begin with (pressing ^L fixed it)
[23:02:07] <j999> It's nice to login to it, detach and reattach unaffected by GUI or intermittent network connections
[23:03:12] <Urchlay> j999: yeah, I use that much of screen (this irssi session is actually running inside screen), but these days that's about all I do with it ("screen irssi" to start IRC, then occasionally have to reattach after restarting X)
[23:03:39] <j999> yeah, mine too
[23:03:50] <Urchlay> other than the reattach-ability, I forget I'm even using screen (except having to hit ^A twice)
[23:04:05] <j999> sweet
[23:04:06] <Urchlay> my normal shells though, I don't want screen for those
[23:04:50] <j999> I just setup playing video in my console (fbdev) with mplayer, nice!
[23:04:53] <Urchlay> I've already got 2 levels: several virtual desktops, each with 2 or 3 xterms
[23:04:55] <mad_enz> trying to go from 12TB to 10TB is taking over a week...progress never gets past 5 Xs
[23:05:12] <Urchlay> so I can already get confused: which desktop & xterm did I leave $whatever running on?
[23:05:18] <Urchlay> add screen to it, now I've got 3 levels
[23:05:31] <Urchlay> which is just more headache than it's worth
[23:05:40] <j999> do you use "screen -D -R"?

[23:30:11] <xla113> wood_quinn: if you are not willing to help stop wasting my time
[23:30:20] <wood_quinn> I'm not wasting your time.
[23:30:21] <wood_quinn> You are.
[23:31:12] <wood_quinn> No one here is going to help you with a -current problem when you clearly aren't a developer, using -current for a reason, or giving specific information about the problem.
[23:31:30] <wood_quinn> That's the way this channel works.
[23:31:36] <stink_imp> xla113: oh ... actually ... might be that udev doesn't actually keep information on sda/sdb ... might just be the order the devices are connected on your motherboard. try changing that.
[23:33:06] <wood_quinn> I don't know that BIOS can boot to a non-primary hard drive without you knowing it's doing it.

[23:37:35] <hplc> talking of current, does slackware allow for downgrade as well as upgrade? or is it a one-way road?
[23:38:30] <wood_quinn> To/from current?
[23:39:13] <wood_quinn> I wouldn't expect a working system after downgrading from current any more than I would after upgrading to current.
[23:39:40] <hplc> ty, that answers my question :)

[23:43:23] <xla113> wood_quinn: how long have you been using slackware and linux in general?
[23:43:55] Nick change: niels_ho1n -> niels_horn
[23:44:41] <KaMii> pat really just needs to rename -current to -beta-will-break-your-system-dont-use-n00bs

[23:47:09] <hplc> hmm its seems slack is not for everyone, if i understand it correctly that package list is very sensitive, or rather, slack puts every bit of responsibility in the hands of the one that choose to use it
[23:47:22] egasco_ (~egasco@190.18.48.205) joined ##slackware.
[23:47:42] <jgeboski> it's just "simple," and you're in control
[23:48:36] <hplc> yes, i begin to see the beuty of it, but it takes, how to say? "measure twice, cut once" or how the english expression goes
[23:49:09] Lorem-Ipsum (~Lorem-Ips@unaffiliated/lorem-ipsum) left irc: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[23:49:13] <mad_enz> hplc: correct, you are in control. The package list is not that all sensitive. you simply need to get familiar with it
[23:50:31] <mad_enz> hplc: u could do something like slackpkg install kde to install all kde packages
[23:51:01] <hplc> still so many seem to end up with a corrupt list?, it feels like walking in cambodia, i.e "watch where you put down your F**ing foot"
[23:51:23] <hplc> sorry for my language
[23:51:33] <hplc> just couldnt help it
[23:51:48] <Schism-> well, in other distros you can end up in dependency hell with corrupt databases or inconsistent libraries
[23:51:53] <mad_enz> actually, it's nothing like that
[23:51:57] <wed> Dare to screw up a bit, It's good learning
[23:52:36] <mad_enz> IMHO, auto dependency install is more like being in cambodia...one wrong dependency and ur system is toast
[23:53:35] <hplc> hmm my first install, perhaps a deliberate screw-up or two could be of use in the process of learning
[23:53:45] <poprocks> It's like I was saying to an old friend of mine on google+ today.  Sure, auto-dep-resolution is kind of nice for end users.  But on a server setup, if you run an application and it complains about missing libraries or symbols, and you don't know how to resolve that issue, you probably shouldn't be a UNIX sysadmin.
[23:54:19] <KaMii> whats wrong with just installing everything?
[23:54:30] <hplc> have to agree with poprocks on that one
[23:55:29] <KaMii> i dont understand why new people come into slackware and decide to choose an expert install
[23:55:35] <mad_enz> installing everything is so much bloat
[23:55:53] <mad_enz> how else will they learn how to fix things?
[23:55:54] <KaMii> even most of the 'experts' still run a full install of linux because we have better things to do than sift through packages
[23:55:55] <wood_quinn> xla113: I've been using Slackware for three years, and I've been using Linux for about six.
[23:56:01] <wood_quinn> Not that that's relevant.
[23:56:02] <KaMii> mad_enz: its not bload
[23:56:12] <KaMii> if you are not using it, it will never be hitting your reources
[23:56:24] <wood_quinn> Unless you have a small disc.
[23:56:47] <poprocks> Meh. A full install on Slackware isn't that bloated, given how cheap and readily available disk space is these days. ~ 7.3 GB?  Pffft.  Some *single games* are twice that size.
[23:56:48] <mad_enz> not when disk space is a premium...
[23:56:51] <wood_quinn> But ~8GB is usually not much.
[23:56:54] <hplc> todays TB HDD sure allows for it
[23:57:02] <poprocks> Plus, subtract KDE and it's not bloated *at all*
[23:57:12] <wood_quinn> If you want to save disc space, don't install KDE, KDEI, XFCE, or XAP.
[23:57:14] <KaMii> wood_quinn: then get with 2013 and buy a decent sized hdd
[23:57:19] <KaMii> hdd space is cheap
[23:57:29] <mad_enz> cheap for you maybe
[23:57:32] phe (~phe@wikimedia/phe) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[23:57:36] <wood_quinn> Not including those four things, IMO, don't count as not haiving a full install.
[23:58:03] <mad_enz> every bit is a precious commodity in my house
[23:58:13] <wed> It's a bit of a bother actually. I enjoy having the system on a device of its own. But there are no small disks left in the world
[23:58:13] <KaMii> i dont understand how people come to the blind conclusion that a full isntall of slackware is bloat
[23:58:13] <poprocks> wood_quinn: true, but if you eliminate those particular floppysets, with what you have left you're certainly not going to have any dep issues
[23:58:43] <KaMii> wed: well, sorta... you can still get a small SSD if you want to waste the money
[23:59:00] <wood_quinn> wed: That's what partitions are for lol.
[23:59:02] <mad_enz> i would never advise anyone to do a full install...noobs need to learn and no better way than picking through packages
[23:59:13] <wood_quinn> mad_enz: No.
[23:59:16] <wood_quinn> Just no.
[23:59:19] <mad_enz> yes!
[23:59:29] <wood_quinn> Picking through package names/descriptions doesn't teach you anything.
[23:59:30] <KaMii> i wish some manufacterers would just make ultra fast rpm 40 gig hdd's for the OS to sit on

[23:59:43] <poprocks> Lol. Depends on what they want to get out of Slackware.  A usable workstation, or a learning experience.
