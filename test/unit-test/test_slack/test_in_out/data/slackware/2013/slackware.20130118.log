[02:03:02] soooga (~soooga@112.192.187.155) joined ##slackware.
[02:03:10] <pink_mist> slackware doesn't do hardware support. that comes from either the linux kernel itself, or 3rd party drivers.
[02:03:22] <pink_mist> if it isn't in the linux kernel, there are likely drivers from your vendor.
[02:03:32] <pink_mist> also check on sbo
[02:03:38] <pink_mist> they might have your drivers there
[02:03:43] <pink_mist> and if so, it's the best place to get from
[02:04:05] <pink_mist> and by 'sbo', I of course mean http://www.slackbuilds.org
[02:04:51] <pink_mist> (I don't know what an 'x1950 card' is, so I can't say anything beyond that)
[02:05:04] <thumbs> AIT
[02:05:08] <thumbs> ATI, rather
[02:05:21] <gnisho> linuxguy, it seems the x1950 is no longer supported under current ATI drivers.   If you can find older drivers and make them work, well, good luck.  another option would be to try the open source drivers.

[02:06:21] <linuxguy> pink_mist ok thanks.its a 512mb agp card.from about 2009.ive notice that ati \amd have moved this card to legacy.and i dont think the drivers work for it either :(
[02:06:31] <linuxguy> thats why im having problems

[02:07:14] <wood_quinn> This has been hashed out before.
[02:07:42] <linuxguy> its just that their site points to a newer one.when trying to install it says like imcompatibe driver :(
[02:07:43] <NyteOwl> all "legacy" means to ATI is they no longer develope anything new for the cards. Any supported features developed up to the time they were declared "lergacy" are suported. The plain old vanilla open source driver should work fine

[08:38:25] <BlueBonzoid> dhcpcd already running pid 9834

[08:38:43] <pink_mist> or router
[08:38:59] <BlueBonzoid> yeah its just a pos linksys that usually works
[08:39:26] <BlueBonzoid> I am on it with this laptop
[08:39:49] <pink_mist> so you can network with it
[08:40:06] <pink_mist> then why did you say you couldn't?
[08:40:14] <BlueBonzoid> my desktop
[08:40:46] <BlueBonzoid> I am trying to get my desktop connected...
[08:41:19] <BlueBonzoid> so the problem is at the access point?
[08:41:21] <pink_mist> is it whitelisted?
[08:41:28] <pink_mist> does it need whitelisting?
[08:41:37] <pink_mist> does it have the correct password?
[08:41:51] <BlueBonzoid> it may, I cant get into the router control says error 500
[08:42:22] <pink_mist> sounds like you should reboot it
[08:42:42] <darwin> yes, I think it should be in a full install as an alternative to KDE4

[09:07:54] <TommyC> it's possible that you're missing some firmware (I don't know about that specific wireless chip)
[09:08:26] <BlueBonzoid> oh and it connects to unencrypted networks fine
[09:08:39] <TommyC> well, there's some drivers/firmware for it on SlackBuilds.org
[09:08:51] <KaMii> use wicd

[09:09:27] <TommyC> what error message(s) do you get if you attempt to connect to an encrypted network?
[09:09:45] <BlueBonzoid> just waits for lease
[09:09:52] <BlueBonzoid> or broadcasts for one
[09:10:18] <TommyC> and how are you providing the passphrase/key or whatnot for the encrypted networks?
[09:10:27] <BlueBonzoid> wpa_gui
[09:10:30] <KaMii> maybe it cant handle the same kind of encryption you have set on your router
[09:11:15] <TommyC> hmmm, I've never used wpa_gui but iirc, it's just a gui frontend for wpa_supplicant
[09:11:44] <BlueBonzoid> yeah
[09:11:51] <TommyC> check your /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file and see if it has a network block for the network you're trying to connect to
[09:12:06] <TommyC> if it doesn't, and you don't want to go through the hassle of setting it up, you can use something like NetworkManager or wicd
[09:12:12] <KaMii> or you telling to use the wrong kind of encryption, so it never works
[09:12:15] <BlueBonzoid> yeah the gui just lets me scan then add the network block fresh
[09:12:32] <KaMii> use wicd

[09:12:59] <BlueBonzoid> is wicd the NM thing that is in KDE?
[09:13:03] <TommyC> no
[09:13:11] <KaMii> no
[09:13:12] <BlueBonzoid> down in the systray
[09:13:15] <KaMii> its in /extra
[09:13:19] <KaMii> slackpkg install wicd
[09:13:27] <TommyC> it's a less non-gconf requiring non-resource hogging better version of NetworkManager that's available for all DE's and WM's
[09:14:56] <BlueBonzoid> ok... does it just send commands to wpa-supplicant?
[09:15:28] <pink_mist> don't think it uses wpa-supplicant
[09:15:29] <TommyC> I think it does use wpa_supplicant for encrypted networks, but it won't make a network block in your /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf (that still has to be done manually)
[09:15:36] <pink_mist> oh it does?
[09:15:37] <pink_mist> huh
[09:15:53] <TommyC> I'm not 100% sure, but I can't think of anything else that would give access to a protected AP.
[09:16:30] <TommyC> wireless-tools will work for any AP that doesn't require WPA/WPA2 authentication (I've heard mixed things on whether or not it can do WEP, though)

[11:53:46] <newbsduser> iam creating tar ball  of a directory... tar doesn't compress so i guess directory's size "du -s mydir/" should be the same with "du -s mydir.tar",,, but sizes are not the same why??
[11:55:02] <ruskie> because tar is more efficient
[11:55:09] <ruskie> each file takes a set amount of space on disk
[11:55:19] <ruskie> depending on how it's formated
[11:55:27] <ruskie> a single file can take at minimum 4k
[11:55:35] <ruskie> so even if a file is 1k it will still take 4k
[11:56:29] <TheM4ch1n3> depends on filesystem blocksize
[11:56:30] <newbsduser> tar ball is smaller than mydir
[11:56:37] <ruskie> as said
[11:58:00] <ruskie> so if you have 4 1k files on a 4k blocksize fs it will be 16k in size... while tar will store that as 4k since it isn't reliant on the filesystem blocksize
[11:58:32] <ruskie> try du --apparent-size mydir
[11:58:55] <ruskie> should show it a bit closer most likely
[11:59:27] <newbsduser> can i re-calculate mydirsize from mydir.tar?
[11:59:46] <newbsduser> i want to check tar is correctly include all files in directory or not?
[12:00:08] <ruskie> you could extract the tarball into a separate dir
[12:00:19] <ruskie> then compare the sizes again or md5sums or something
[12:00:53] <newbsduser> tar is very huge.. so extracting is not good solution for me
[12:01:08] <newbsduser> dirsize: 250gb  tar size: 25g
[12:01:17] <TheM4ch1n3> find . -type f -exec md5sum -b {} \; 2>&1 | tee md5sums
[12:01:37] <ruskie> TheM4ch1n3, that doesn't solve the compare tarball with system

[12:04:00] <TheM4ch1n3> there may be sparse files try:

[14:03:23] <NightTiger> exitlight:  Length, width, height, time is the usual...
[14:03:50] <exitlight> NightTiger i mean how to view it?
[14:04:17] <exitlight> i can use blender to do a 3D array, but a 4D?
[14:04:41] <NightTiger> Good luck with that! Maybe moving along a track?
[14:05:14] <BrokenCog> how ... to ... visualize ... a ... 4 ... dimensional ... item ....
[14:05:16] <exitlight> perhaps there is another variable other than time?
[14:05:28] <BrokenCog> wow.  knock on Einstiens gave when you figure out that one.
[14:05:53] <exitlight> LOL

[14:07:05] <exitlight> NightTiger not sure, its an experiment :p
[14:07:43] <exitlight> w, x, y, z?
[14:08:47] <NightTiger> Representing 3 dims on a 2-d screen is awkward enough - I think you need more math than I know to figure this one out, sorry.
[14:08:59] <BrokenCog> horizontal, vertical, time, to-infinity.
[14:09:43] <exitlight> basically a 2D array is just a collection of various colums
[14:09:55] <BrokenCog> okay, seriously: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2834931/what-methods-are-used-to-visualize-a-4-dimensional-array
[14:10:40] <exitlight> so a 3D array is just a collection of couple of 2D arrays, no?
[14:10:47] <BrokenCog> yes.
[14:10:52] <NightTiger> for (z=begin; z=end; z+=increment) plot(w,x,y); ??
[14:10:57] <BrokenCog> 4d array is just a collection of 3d arrays.
[14:11:15] <BrokenCog> plot( x,y,w,z )
[14:11:52] <BrokenCog> some good samples in that SO question.

[14:13:59] Detch (~uriel@unaffiliated/detch) joined ##slackware.
[14:14:43] <NightTiger> If you like, but it's the usual visualisation technique.
[14:14:50] <BrokenCog> time is one option for the 4th dim ... nofra: hence the visual in "Donny Darko"
[14:15:16] <BrokenCog> rows of 3d objects are more traditionally used to represent 4d.

[16:14:56] <senator> iron_houzi: this next statement exhausts my insight into the matter, but one way that might happen would be if the vim package were built from the 14.0 slackbuild on your system with a different version of python installed than the 2.7 which comes with slack 14. or, i guess, if you replace python2.7 with something else after installing slack14
[16:15:22] <iron_houzi> Banish: It's a dump stating that your program crashed when running code from libc-2.15.so and I assume the hex values are the values of the relevant places in memory ..

[20:29:55] <kaleun> In your case you should probably try updating the firmware. And then try again.
[20:30:02] <wizbit> aye indeed
[20:30:09] <kaleun> If the update doesn't work then you should just get a new drive, in my opinion.
[20:30:18] <wizbit> ok
[20:30:24] <nyteowl> wizbit: if there is a known problem with the current firmware version that may potentially affect data integrety then upgrading is a good idea. I had to do that with a particular model drive I have here. but the drive itself had not caused my problems to that point, it was merely a preventative measure
[20:30:35] <jgeboski> also, make sure if you're drive is using 4K sectors, that your partitions are aligned correctly

[21:40:16] <TommyC> I would say be careful if you're going to have the same /home/<user> directory shared.
[21:40:35] <Urchlay> kullix: last time I tried that (a long time ago now), I ran into trouble... the 2 distros would have 2 different versions of something, and the config file syntax would be different for the newer version

[21:41:02] <bedtime> thats what i was thinking
