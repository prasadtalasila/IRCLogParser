[01:25:14] <Skywise> learn how to read man pages and you'll be set

[01:33:47] <anunnaki> i was told slackware not for newbies but bagira told me that i should use it being that im still using ubuntu..
[01:34:02] <pink_mist> I was a newbie the first time I used slackware
[01:34:20] <pink_mist> that was a bit more than 15 years ago though

[01:39:04] <TommyC> SAme situation for me, except I'm not as long ago.
[01:39:05] <Jdogzz> I think that most users should start with Slackware and go from there. When you use something like Ubuntu you miss out on so much and the little about linux that you do learn can easily be replicated with Slackware.
[01:39:28] <pink_mist> if most people are to judge by, if you want to experience distro hopping, stay away from slackware (you won't want to hop anymore..) :P
[01:39:56] <pitz> yeah..  i run those other OS' in VMs on my slackware system :D
[01:40:04] <Jdogzz> pink_mist: What distros did you use before Slackware?
[01:41:34] <pink_mist> back then there weren't many to choose from ... slackware was my first one ... since then though I've tried both Red Hat (back when that was what it was still called), Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Fedora, Suse (back when it was still Suse), Mandrake (back when that existed..) ... and probably some more that I've forgotten
[01:42:13] <pink_mist> but always I've come back to slackware
[01:42:13] <Jdogzz> Impressive:) But Slackware is still your favorite after all that?
[01:42:16] <pink_mist> yeah
[01:42:16] s0n1c- (c902168b@gateway/web/freenode/ip.201.2.22.139) joined ##slackware.
[01:42:43] <Jdogzz> Slackware iz 4ever.
[01:42:44] <anunnaki> well i was told to just dive into Arch but then was told to do Slackware before trying Arch..
[01:42:49] <anunnaki> does this sound about right
[01:43:19] <mmlj4> if netbsd actually worked, I'd use that and nothing else
[01:43:20] <pink_mist> anunnaki: no one here is likely to recommend you go for arch instead of slackware :P
[01:43:54] <pink_mist> anunnaki: if you go for slack, do have a look at the docs and book links in the topic
[01:44:25] <pink_mist> anyhow, it's late, time for me to head to bed
[01:44:28] wbooze (~wbooze@xdsl-78-35-131-62.netcologne.de) joined ##slackware.
[01:46:16] <anunnaki> well i was about to install fedora.. and went into Arch they said try Arch is something i have to learn by hands on experience really
[01:46:40] <anunnaki> till bagira told me slackware was more appropriate for me knowing i was about to install fedora but talking a bout Arch...
[01:47:12] <anunnaki> amazing how narrowing down linux can be a task haha
[01:47:40] <Jdogzz> It's really a personal preference in the end, but it's been my experience that once you get settled into Slackware you don't ever really want to leave. It's really stable, so you can expect updates to not break your system, but you are welcome to tinker with the system as much as you want without the OS getting in your way.

[03:15:10] <KaMii> well if you want to test your css on windows, I would suggest you put it in a virtual machine

[03:22:43] <xocel> e.g multiplayer notepad
[03:23:39] <xocel> anyone viewing the pad and also edit it. Assuming its not read-only.
[03:24:40] <xocel> Useful when helping people fix their code, no need to paste back and forth etc. Also writing stuff, as there can people others writing/proof reading at the same time :)

[03:37:09] <xocel> haha. modx actually looks quite nice for a cms.  But i dont want an http server as a requirement. Apache is running on the server but its not serving any content. just proxying port 80 to etherpads port currently. Well ad a web admin type interfaces. What i have so far uses express.js(to serve the content) and passport.js for authentication. Uses mongodb to store everything.
[03:37:38] <xocel> argh, i mean an external http server. one running in node is fine :)
[03:37:44] <wood_quinn> .js stuff is JavaScript right?
[03:38:10] <xocel> node.js is server side javascript.
[03:38:35] <wood_quinn> I've heard of it.
[03:38:48] <wood_quinn> So how does it work?
[03:39:24] <wood_quinn> I'd assume not ./node.js --args
[03:39:44] <xocel> its very cool. Although coding async can be a bit of a mind fuck at times.

[03:52:10] <xocel> yep. Allocating 'x' amount of resources to a thread whether it needs it or not can result in a lot of wasted resources :/ node deals with that very well. A task gets what it needs, and nothing else. (well, ideally)
[03:52:23] <wood_quinn> Interesting.
[03:53:15] <NyteOwl> Joyent, the company that tried to shaft the folks that helped it actually get started in hosting
[03:53:29] <wood_quinn> Has anyone done benchmarks to see how much faster it is at tasks that are typically handled by other languages?
[03:53:52] <d4wnr4z0r> whatever joyent might have done, they have ex-SUN engineers.
[03:55:04] <wood_quinn> Like I said, I'm not a programmer, but I do find it interesting so I might tinker.
[03:55:07] <NyteOwl> buysb them nothing in my book
[03:56:22] <d4wnr4z0r> it buys their tech something.

[05:49:48] <KaMii> lol
[05:49:56] <wood_quinn> Or no, a model.

[05:50:07] <Skywise> some people can't relate to having sex just for fun
[05:50:08] <KaMii> then its just making a porno
[05:50:08] <wood_quinn> Gotta me a video to make her an actress.
[05:50:15] <KaMii> just show up with a camera
[05:50:39] <Skywise> you gotta register porn videos and certify the talent is over 18
[05:50:48] <KaMii> thats not hard to do
[05:50:52] <wood_quinn> If some woman wants to have sex for fun, that's fine. But I don't want anything to do with her.
[05:50:53] <KaMii> you can start a llc for nothing

[05:51:09] <KaMii> lol
[05:51:15] <KaMii> if shes hot
[05:51:27] <Skywise> the real reason prostitution is banned is because they become too powerful
[05:51:51] <KaMii> no its because of people trafficking and pimps
[05:52:07] <Skywise> no, they make too much money and usually service all the men in power
[05:52:07] <KaMii> prostitution should be legal, but men should not be allowed to be involved

[05:52:16] <Crosma> Prostitution is legal in most western countries.
[05:52:23] <Skywise> i wouldn't say most

[05:54:31] <KaMii> Skywise: only in amserdam in the red light district
[05:54:48] <KaMii> since when was wikipedia a legal website?
[05:54:51] <KaMii> i dont trust it
[05:54:57] <KaMii> for legal advise
[05:54:58] <Crosma> Ok, don't believe Wikipedia then.
[05:55:36] <Skywise> did you read that snippet?
[05:55:42] <Crosma> Yes.
[05:55:42] <Skywise> it doesn't make your argument
[05:55:53] <Crosma> It says that it's legal but brothels and solicitation aren't.
[05:55:53] <Skywise> in fact it just quibbles over the definition
[05:55:59] <NyteOwl> Wikipedia is ahrdly an authoritative soruce, ewspecially in matters of law heh
[05:56:22] <KaMii> im sure there are lots of laws and definition about prostitution in canada
[05:56:29] <KaMii> a law is never that simple
[05:56:33] <Crosma> I know!
[05:56:36] <Skywise> either way, it doesn't change the situation
[05:56:40] <Crosma> But you can exchange sex for money.
[05:56:41] <KaMii> if you think it is, your high
[05:56:46] <Skywise> they arrest prostitutes in canada
[05:56:47] <Soul_keeper> I trust wiki more than a random person I meet, just a matter of considering the source
[05:56:59] <Crosma> You can exchange sex for money in basically all of the EU, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.
[05:57:11] <wood_quinn> You can exchange sex for dinner.
[05:57:13] <NyteOwl> sure you can - doesn't make it elgal heh
[05:57:15] <wood_quinn> Why bother using money.
[05:57:21] <NyteOwl> wood_quinn: done all the time :p
[05:57:23] <wood_quinn> Dinner is completely lega.
[05:57:27] <Crosma> Yes, legally, NyteOwl.
[05:57:28] <Skywise> thats otherwise known as dating
[05:57:33] <shonudo> heh
[05:57:39] <NyteOwl> asnyway, this isn't clsoe to on topic (as usual).
[05:57:39] <Soul_keeper> nevada is legal long as they pay their taxes right ?
[05:57:40] <KaMii> Crosma: use that argument in court and tell me how it works out
[05:57:46] <Crosma> You guys have been mislead, or are making false assumptions.
[05:57:48] <wood_quinn> Joking aside, many people do it fully intending to get around anti-prostitution laws.
[05:57:57] <KaMii> i hear a lot of prisons have internet so you can probably get irc there
[05:58:17] <shonudo> hmmm, bet that's not true
[05:58:22] <Skywise> the thing in holland is that they're regulated and tested, and thats the only place i'd use one
[05:58:29] <Crosma> Prostitution is a legal government recognised occupation in Australia and New Zealand. It's in the tax code.
[05:58:36] <Skywise> everyone has to practice safe sex by law
[05:59:02] <Skywise> are you some kinda sex travel guide?
[05:59:02] <wood_quinn> Except people doing it recreationally.
[05:59:03] <shonudo> there's a condom that fits over the whole country
[05:59:06] <shonudo> it's amazing
[05:59:07] <KaMii> its not legal in all of nevada, like its illegal in vegas
[05:59:08] <Crosma> I don't know where you guys get your facts. I link to Wikipedia and you all just go, "Well, we don't believe Wikipedia. Try it in court. lol"
[05:59:20] <KaMii> Skywise: i think hes a pimp
[05:59:39] <wood_quinn> Oi, fully law-abidin' business hea!
[05:59:44] <Skywise> pimpin is hard
[05:59:52] <KaMii> not for butters
[05:59:56] <KaMii> lol
[06:00:00] <wood_quinn> Look a mah hat an' cane, how could a felon affo'd dis?
[06:00:37] <Crosma> I'm still right. :P
[06:00:59] <KaMii> is that what this was about?
[06:01:04] <KaMii> just you wanting to be right?
[06:01:11] <shonudo> everything is about being right
[06:01:23] <Crosma> No, I know sex workers personally and I dislike false information being spread about it.
[06:01:26] <wood_quinn> shonudo is wrong.
[06:01:41] <KaMii> Crosma: then fine, your right, go to all those places, buy whores and then when you get arrested, tell them, 'but I'm right!'
[06:01:42] <shonudo> shit, no comeback
[06:01:45] <Crosma> You were basically all just wrong and wouldn't even believe the facts. :P
[06:01:50] <shonudo> you win, wood_quinn
[06:01:51] <wood_quinn> Honestly, nothing says low expectations quite like prostitution.
[06:02:02] <wood_quinn> Doesn't mean they're bad folks.
[06:02:09] <Crosma> It's legal to run a brothel where I live.
[06:02:11] <Crosma> In Australia.
[06:02:22] <wood_quinn> I just can't think of a single person I know that couldn't do better.
[06:02:47] <wood_quinn> Unless you're one of those Firefly companions, getting to choose compatible folks and all that jazz.
[06:03:04] <KaMii> i know some girls that should probably be prostitutes, they dont really seem to have any skills to do anything else
[06:03:21] <Crosma> http://www.workcover.nsw.gov.au/formspublications/publications/Documents/brothels_health_safety_guidelines_English_0120.pdf
[06:03:32] <Crosma> Government website guidelines for running a legal brothel in Australia.
[06:03:44] <KaMii> well, now that we all know Crosma owns a brothel and is a pimp......
[06:03:48] <KaMii> next topic
[06:03:56] <wood_quinn> Yes.
[06:04:01] <Crosma> No, we know that you're blatantly wrong, but can't accept facts.
[06:04:11] <wood_quinn> Next offtopic topic.
[06:04:13] <KaMii> i never said anything about australia
[06:04:26] <KaMii> i was talking mainly europe
[06:04:34] <Crosma> In Europe it's mainly legal anyway.
[06:04:40] <Crosma> Just not brothels or solicitation.
[06:04:51] <Crosma> It's legal in the UK, France and Germany for a start.
[06:05:17] <wood_quinn> Anyone here know of any cool node.js stuff?
[06:05:18] <KaMii> Crosma: i use to live in paris, there is a huge people traffickign and undergrouond prostitution rings there
[06:05:23] <KaMii> its all illegal
[06:05:48] <KaMii> and germany, its legal in some cities i know
[06:06:04] <Crosma> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_France#Legal_status
[06:06:09] <Crosma> Says it's legal in Frace.
[06:06:14] <Crosma> France. I know you don't believe it though.
[06:06:16] <KaMii> again with wikipedia
[06:06:35] <Crosma> Heh. Someone's edited them all?
[06:06:39] <Crosma> Who would do that?
[06:06:45] <Crosma> Gosh.
[06:07:06] <KaMii> the big issue is the definition of prostitution
[06:07:13] WildWizard (~michael@ppp118-208-15-230.lns20.bne1.internode.on.net) left irc: Quit: Leaving.
[06:07:29] <KaMii> and each country / munincipality / city makes their own definition, then their own law
[06:07:37] <Skywise> yeah, they're just mincing words
[06:07:48] <Crosma> No they don't. You can exchange sex for money in France. QED.
[06:07:54] <KaMii> its not as 'legal' as you think
[06:08:10] <Crosma> You can file taxes as a prostitute in France and won't be breaking the law.
[06:08:19] <Crosma> You cannot run a brothel.
[06:08:22] <Crosma> You cannot advertise.
[06:08:33] <KaMii> omg, seriously i dont care about talking about prostitution anymore
[06:08:50] <wood_quinn> Did anyone ever?
[06:08:58] <KaMii> Crosma: did
[06:09:00] <Crosma> I'm just sick of disinformation about it.
[06:09:00] <KaMii> does
[06:09:14] Action: KaMii hears the waaaaammmmbulance

[06:53:48] <KaMii> and besides, dark chocolate is the best anywy
[06:53:55] <KaMii> why fuck it up by putting milk in it?
[06:53:59] <Skywise> i likeit
[06:54:06] <KaMii> but i rarely eat candy
[06:54:26] <Skywise> i don't each much candy but i do eat chocolate
[06:54:33] <KaMii> too much sugar and junk
[06:54:40] <Skywise> like chocolate covered raisins or peanuts
[06:54:47] <KaMii> makes my stomach hurt, so i never eat it
[06:54:56] <Skywise> or trail mix with chocolate bits in it
[06:55:03] <KaMii> well, not never but very rarely do i eat candy
[06:55:17] <Skywise> i don't like most candy bars now cause they're made with hfcs and its too sweet
[06:55:40] <KaMii> candy bars make my teeth hurt soooo bad
[06:56:09] <KaMii> i dont know but it never hurt my teeth until i came to the usa and tried some candy bars
[06:56:19] <Skywise> i see
[06:56:33] <KaMii> the ones in europe dont hurt my teeth, so i just figure they put poision or something in all candy in the usa, so I dont eat it
[06:56:37] <Skywise> well, i think they're too sweet also
[06:57:40] <KaMii> my dentist said i have sensitive teeth to sweets

[07:37:58] <wood_quinn> That's the lowest I can go.

[07:39:16] Action: Skaperen notices it also has a hole chewed out of it
[07:39:21] <Skywise> i was gonna say something like yea we can tell cause you're talking out of it, but i decided not too
[07:39:56] <Skaperen> wise decision
[07:40:10] <KaMii> too late

[07:42:12] <KaMii> my parents never forced me to bed
[07:42:38] <KaMii> well maybe when i was little they would tell me its bed time, but they stopped doing that a long time ago
[07:42:54] <Skywise> i grew up in the age where parents thought thats what they should do
[07:43:02] <Skywise> yeah, they all stop eventually
[07:43:19] <KaMii> i grew up with parents that didnt treat me like a slave
[07:43:28] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[07:43:31] <Skywise> in high school i could stay up to 11 on weekdays and then i could stay up to watch letterman in my room'
[07:43:45] <wood_quinn> I grew up with parents that didn't think of parenting as slavery.
[07:43:56] <Skywise> well, my parents didn't think kids were the most precious things in the world
[07:44:33] <Skywise> if my parents lost a kid they'd just make another and keep going

[07:47:06] <Skywise> cause i never understood why other parents would let their kids misbehave
[07:47:25] <wood_quinn> Because most parents shouldn't be parents.
[07:47:32] <Skywise> my mom wouldn't hesitate to put us in our place
[07:47:51] <Skywise> she could carry on a conversation while beating out ass without missing a beat

[07:50:40] <Skywise> yeah, its a shame, but she was right
[07:51:23] <Skywise> its the same way with dogs, that discipline keeps them out of trouble they'd otherwise be in
[07:51:57] <Skywise> you know hanging out with my friends, i was never worried about the cops, i was worried if my mom found out, and she didn't need warrants or even proof

[07:59:18] <KaMii> spanking is illegal
[07:59:30] <wood_quinn> No it's not.
[07:59:38] <wood_quinn> And it's also not immoral.
[07:59:39] <KaMii> in sweden it is
[07:59:50] <wood_quinn> I doubt that.

[07:59:54] <KaMii> you will lose your children if you spank them
[07:59:59] <KaMii> wood_quinn: yes it is very illegal
[08:00:01] <wood_quinn> Again, I doubt that.
[08:00:06] <KaMii> pink_mist:
[08:00:16] <wood_quinn> There are very few child protection laws that are that specific.
[08:00:26] <KaMii> in sweden, that one is very specific
[08:00:33] <wood_quinn> And for good reason, it's not the government's job to dictate how to parent your children.
[08:00:43] <KaMii> it is in sweden
[08:00:51] <wood_quinn> Each case needs to be reviewed and the circumstances weighed.
[08:01:10] <KaMii> well, sweden isnt the usa
[08:01:15] <KaMii> the ideas are different
[08:01:54] <wood_quinn> So how are you supposed to discipline your children? Is there a government time-out mandate? Lol.
[08:02:33] <KaMii> well, you just cant hit a child, you cannot use spanking or any form of physical punishment
[08:02:42] <KaMii> because it is child abuse in sweden
[08:02:48] <wood_quinn> Yeah I seriously doubt that.
[08:02:58] <KaMii> well, its the truth
[08:03:01] <wood_quinn> Hitting a child out of anger is abuse. Hitting a child to punish them isn't.
[08:03:11] <KaMii> i think its the only country in the world where spanking is illegal
[08:03:14] <wood_quinn> Especially on the butt or whatever.
[08:03:42] <wood_quinn> Like I said, there are too many things to take into account for a government to prohibit it.
[08:04:00] <KaMii> http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Society/Child-care/Reading/No-spanking-please/
[08:04:28] <KaMii> Thirty years ago, Sweden became the first nation in the world to prohibit all corporal punishment of children
[08:05:07] <wood_quinn> Wow.
[08:05:08] <KaMii> i would provide you with the law but i dont think you speak swedish or can understand the written language
[08:05:11] <wood_quinn> That's so sad.
[08:05:24] <KaMii> no
[08:05:34] <KaMii> its our right to have what laws we want
[08:05:41] <KaMii> and your rite to have what laws you want
[08:05:50] <KaMii> i think spanking is bad
[08:05:52] <wood_quinn> Typical group of soccer moms petitioning the legislature to ban parenting styles they don't like.
[08:06:12] wbooze (~wbooze@xdsl-78-35-131-62.netcologne.de) left irc: Read error: Operation timed out
[08:06:16] <KaMii> i dont think its ever right to hit a child
[08:06:32] <wood_quinn> They probably also slipped in a bill saying you couldn't let your kid go to public school if they're above average too.
[08:06:45] <wood_quinn> For the sake of the average children's feelings.
[08:07:22] <wood_quinn> Parents often ask us: "But if you do not beat them, how do you discipline your children?"
[08:07:24] <wood_quinn> Oh god.
[08:07:44] <wood_quinn> No parent would use the word "beat" when asking the government how else to discipline their children.
[08:08:10] <KaMii> wood_quinn: bad translation of the word
[08:08:14] <wood_quinn> If hitting your kid gets them taken away, beating them gets you executed.
[08:08:26] <KaMii> no, thats also illegal in sweden
[08:08:27] <wood_quinn> Hell, in the US beating a child gets you sent away for about fifty years.
[08:08:31] <KaMii> there is no capital punishment
[08:08:42] <KaMii> a life sentence in sweden is only 12 years
[08:09:00] <KaMii> but yea, i do think its too easy
[08:09:10] <Urchlay> why isn't it just called a 12 year sentence then? (not specific to sweden, in US it's something like 7 years)
[08:09:18] <KaMii> swedish prison is better than a motel 6 in the usa
[08:09:24] <KaMii> Urchlay: ikr
[08:09:37] <wood_quinn> Dunno, I'm happy I live in a country where the government doesn't intervene unless they have cause.
[08:09:43] <KaMii> but there is some law that says the maximum you can get is 12 years i think
[08:09:57] <KaMii> wood_quinn: then you really will not like socialism
[08:10:03] <wood_quinn> Not just because of some petition by uptight helicopter parents.
[08:10:16] <KaMii> its called socialism
[08:10:42] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: which country is that? (don't say the US, our government isn't well known for leaving well enough alone & hasn't been for 100+ years)
[08:10:58] <KaMii> in socialism the government has the authority to govern your life, and raise children
[08:11:20] <wood_quinn> My dad has worked in human services all his life. I assure you people have a metric ton of freedom to parent their children however they want.
[08:11:29] <KaMii> but swedes just have a totally different perspective on things than in the usa
[08:11:30] <Urchlay> it already does a chunk of the "raise children" part by controlling the public schools
[08:11:47] <KaMii> we dont see no spanking as the government being bad or taking away a right
[08:11:53] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Well that's true, but I was talking about in home parenting.
[08:11:59] <KaMii> we see it as the government extending rights to children like they should
[08:12:10] <KaMii> now the government in sweden gives rights to kids
[08:12:15] <Urchlay> teach them to place hand over heart and pledge allegiance to the flag at a young age... long before they're old enough to understand what the words mean or the ideas
[08:12:24] <wood_quinn> The right of a child to believe they're not gonna get their ass kicked if they piss someone off?
[08:12:31] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[08:12:32] <KaMii> and whats wrong with having your community raise the children?
[08:12:35] <Urchlay> eh, they can believe that
[08:12:46] <KaMii> in sweden the community raises the kids with the parents
[08:12:58] <KaMii> you dont see school shootings happen in sweden
[08:13:05] <Urchlay> you guys don't have any guns, do you?
[08:13:05] <wood_quinn> Again, I just think it's a utopian concept based on unrealistic expectations of kids.
[08:13:28] <wood_quinn> My parent's spanked me, but they stopped doing it when I was old enough that I should have known better.
[08:13:42] <wood_quinn> I yell at my cat when he jumps on the counter, I suppose that's wrong too.
[08:13:43] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea we do, just you have to get a special license and you have to leave them at a gun club or have a special safe put in,
[08:13:46] <Urchlay> not a big fan of gun-control... but that part of it makes sense: no guns for anyone = no guns for school kids.
[08:13:48] <wood_quinn> I should calmly talk it out.
[08:14:05] <wood_quinn> With my cat, who will totally understand and respect my position.
[08:14:18] <KaMii> but there is a ban on handguns in sweden

[08:14:42] <wood_quinn> Obviously.

[08:14:54] <KaMii> kids are not cats
[08:15:10] <wood_quinn> Their perceptions of reality are very similar.
[08:15:16] <KaMii> well, i will never have kids, but if i did, i would never let someone hit them
[08:15:17] <wood_quinn> Eat, sleep, poop, play.
[08:15:20] <KaMii> or spank them
[08:15:42] <Urchlay> KaMii: I don't agree with that. But I dunno exactly where I draw the line, either (private ownership of assault rifles? anti-tank rockets? tanks? thermonuclear devices? not sure how much is too much)

[08:16:45] <Urchlay> because it works
[08:16:50] <KaMii> i dont understand who would say, i totally want to spank my kids!
[08:16:54] <KaMii> Urchlay: it does?
[08:16:57] <wood_quinn> I can't say I want to spank my kids, but I don't want someone to tell me I can't.
[08:17:02] <Urchlay> not beat them bloody, or spank them for trivial BS
[08:17:02] <KaMii> were you ever spanked more than once?
[08:17:05] <wood_quinn> Just because they think they know better.
[08:17:15] <Urchlay> more than once, less than 10 times probably.
[08:17:26] <KaMii> well im pretty sure any parent that spanks, never did it just once
[08:17:30] <KaMii> so it doesnt work
[08:17:34] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[08:17:40] <wood_quinn> Fuck rehab.
[08:17:48] <wood_quinn> It doesn't work, because people do it more than once.
[08:18:17] <wood_quinn> Down with prisons, traffic tickets, and diets!
[08:18:21] <KaMii> you can raise good kids without spanking them
[08:18:26] <wood_quinn> 'cuz people do them more than once!
[08:18:26] <Urchlay> not sure
[08:18:43] <wood_quinn> Point being, you don't know my kids.
[08:18:46] <wood_quinn> I do.

[08:19:26] <wood_quinn> KaMii: I'm pretty sure if your folks rapped you across the knuckles with a ruler every time you burned something you'd pay more attention to the stove.
[08:19:27] <KaMii> so you think if my parents spanked me everytime i accidentally burned something when cooking, that I would never do it again?
[08:19:37] <Urchlay> if kids aren't afraid of anything, if your own kid says "Fuck you" and does whatever he wants... and won't listen to your adult and rational reasoning (because he's a kid and irrational)... sooner or later that kid will end up hurting someone and going to jail
[08:19:45] <wood_quinn> I think you'd do it less often than once a day.
[08:19:51] <KaMii> wood_quinn: wtf, why are you talking about my parents raping me?
[08:19:53] <Urchlay> KaMii: that's not a spanking offense in my view, anyway
[08:19:54] <KaMii> thats just sick!
[08:19:59] <wood_quinn> Rapping. Hitting.
[08:20:16] <wood_quinn> Tapping.
[08:20:27] <KaMii> oh
[08:20:27] <Urchlay> KaMii: stealing $100 from mom's purse and buying crack with it = spanking
[08:20:34] <wood_quinn> You don't calmly tell a kid the stove is hot.
[08:20:39] <wood_quinn> You let them touch it.
[08:20:46] <KaMii> Urchlay: i dont think you should teach with fear
[08:20:59] <wood_quinn> Suppose that's abuse if you force them to touch it, but I don't think hitting them for trying to hit it is.
[08:21:02] <Urchlay> KaMii: beating the crap out of your brother/sister, is a spanking offense
[08:21:06] <wood_quinn> *for trying to touch it
[08:21:28] <KaMii> Urchlay: its not spanking, it has to be an adult, someone over 18 cannot hit someone under 18
[08:21:30] <wood_quinn> Nor is letting them to get the point across.
[08:21:50] <wood_quinn> IMO.
[08:22:02] <Urchlay> KaMii: eh, I meant, when I was a kid, if I beat the crap out of my brother, my dad would beat the crap out of me in return (only fair)
[08:22:04] <KaMii> Urchlay: So, if you want to legally spank, you better have two kids and you tell one to spank the other
[08:22:28] <KaMii> well, lets just agree to disagree
[08:22:36] <KaMii> because im totally against hitting kids
[08:22:40] <KaMii> i think thats wrong
[08:22:43] <Urchlay> what would you do if you had 2 kids, and one of them hit the other?
[08:22:48] <KaMii> and my parents never hit me
[08:22:49] <Urchlay> repeatedly?
[08:22:56] <KaMii> and im not a cold hearted killer
[08:22:59] <Urchlay> yeah, and you're a spoiled rotten little diva :)
[08:23:06] <KaMii> lol
[08:23:11] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Let the one getting hit become emotionally scarred, apparently.
[08:23:14] <KaMii> im not spoiled rotten
[08:23:54] <KaMii> Urchlay: i would take the one that got beat up to a karate class and he will learn to defend himself
[08:24:02] <Skaperen> just rotten
[08:24:06] <KaMii> if the other tries it again, hes gonna lose
[08:24:16] <Skaperen> plain old unspoiled rotten
[08:24:28] <wood_quinn> Funny, people will say they should be allowed to use whatever drugs they want, sell their bodies for money, or various other ethical dillemas.
[08:24:43] <KaMii> Urchlay: im an only child so i guess you can say all only childs are spoiled
[08:24:44] <wood_quinn> But when it comes to kids they gotta push their view on other parents.
[08:25:11] <Urchlay> BTW, to be clear, when I say a kid should be spanked... I don't mean "beaten", nothing that would leave bruises, cause bleeding or broken bones. Nothing that will physically damage them. Spanking is a psychological thing, mostly (it does hurt, but pain can be borne)
[08:25:12] <KaMii> well mine never forced their views on me
[08:25:23] <KaMii> they would always ask what my opinion was, and i tell them
[08:25:26] <Skaperen> we have to decide if we want a world where everyone is protected by a nanny state, or the planet just degrades into rotten filth
[08:25:37] <Skaperen> choose now
[08:25:47] <Urchlay> 3rd option: I want off this planet
[08:25:56] <wood_quinn> I think if someone's willing to ruin my reputation forever by calling DHS, then DHS should get involved.
[08:25:59] <KaMii> Urchlay: help me build my space ship?
[08:25:59] <Skaperen> the ship already left
[08:26:08] <wood_quinn> Otherwise they should go do some paperwork.
[08:26:23] <KaMii> wood_quinn: what does a shipping company have to do with ruining your life?
[08:26:38] <wood_quinn> DHS = Department of Human Services
[08:26:59] <KaMii> oh.. i thought it meant Deutch Handle Service
[08:27:09] <KaMii> or whatever that word is in german
[08:27:12] <KaMii> my german sucks
[08:27:18] <Urchlay> I thought DHS was department of homeland security?
[08:27:21] <wood_quinn> The deal with CHINA (CHild In Need of Assistance) situations.
[08:27:31] <KaMii> wood_quinn: you mean CPS?
[08:27:41] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: That's the federal executive branch.
[08:27:42] <KaMii> Child Protective Services
[08:27:53] <wood_quinn> The state level executive branch is human services.
[08:28:28] <KaMii> and they deal with animals that do not belong to the human species, like the humane society
[08:28:33] <wood_quinn> They deal with mental health and other social services.
[08:28:34] <Urchlay> (the name "homeland security" makes me think of "fatherland" (what the nazis called germany), kinda creeps me out)

[08:41:05] <yskapell> Because with current I have support for everything in my HW
[08:41:20] <wood_quinn> What do you not have support for in 14.0?
[08:41:46] <yskapell> CAn we focus on the issue and no t the version?
[08:41:46] <KaMii> usually support is a kernel issue
[08:41:52] <wood_quinn> yskapell: Nope.
[08:42:00] <wood_quinn> Because -current issues aren't supported here.
[08:42:08] <KaMii> -current is for developers only, it is a heavy beta
[08:42:23] <wood_quinn> If you need a newer kernel, build a newer kernel.
[08:42:40] <yskapell> I do not need a newer kernel
[08:42:41] <KaMii> a new person coming in here saying they use current and having problems gets them flamed
[08:42:52] <yskapell> jus to fix this issue
[08:43:09] <yskapell> and from google I found that this issue exists in previous versions as well
[08:43:15] <Urchlay> yskapell: what piece of hardware have you got that doesn't work in 14.0 but does work in -current?
[08:43:40] <KaMii> i never had that issue ever happening before
[08:43:43] <Urchlay> ...dhcpcd in 14.0 works fine for me on an IPv4-only network
[08:43:53] <KaMii> and ive been using slack since... 12.0?
[08:44:06] <yskapell> Urchlay: the IP you have on eth0 is?
[08:44:17] <wood_quinn> Google shows the issue in other versions?
[08:44:28] <wood_quinn> Care to cite or am I justified in calling BS.
[08:44:37] <KaMii> yskapell: mine has been on eth0 and eth1 and wlan0 wlan1
[08:44:44] <yskapell> yes
[08:44:47] <yskapell> the ip is like
[08:44:53] <yskapell> 192.168.x.x
[08:44:54] <yskapell> ??
[08:44:59] <KaMii> yskapell: lets start from the beginning
[08:45:04] <KaMii> what did you do
[08:45:07] <KaMii> and what was the error
[08:45:22] <Urchlay> yskapell: it's wireless, shows up as wlan0 (and I use wpa_supplicant to get it associated with the AP), but yes, dhcpcd wlan0 works fine
[08:45:29] <KaMii> 192.168.x.x is not an ipv6 issue
[08:45:30] Tomi_E (~Tomi_E@50.36.89.194) joined ##slackware.
[08:45:57] <yskapell> Normally when you ask for an IP you get something
[08:45:58] <yskapell> like
[08:46:01] <yskapell> 192.168.x.x.
[08:46:05] <yskapell> or Class B
[08:46:08] <yskapell> or Class A
[08:46:20] <yskapell> Well I get inet 89.173.x.x
[08:46:20] <Urchlay> yah, I second KaMii's motion: let's have a pastebin of the actual commands you typed and results you got (errors or whatever)
[08:46:38] <Urchlay> whose router is this?
[08:46:42] <KaMii> im thinking he has a router issue and not a slackware issue now
[08:46:53] <yskapell> ARRIS
[08:47:18] <Urchlay> yeah, if it gave you an IPv4 address (even one that's wrong for your network), it isn't dhcpcd's fault, it's the router's
[08:48:09] <yskapell> I install debian stable and testing and the dhcpd from them worked wine
[08:48:11] <Urchlay> I dunno who arris is... an ISP? if they're giving you a bad IP, ask them why
[08:48:11] <yskapell> fine*
[08:48:44] <KaMii> yskapell: you still have yet to show up what commands you typed, and what the error messages or at least the output was
[08:48:45] <Urchlay> ok, again: can we see the actual commands you typed and the actual results you got? go somewhere like pastebin.ca, paste them there, give us the URL

[08:49:40] <Urchlay> we can't guess what the problem is, any more than a mechanic could guess what's wrong with your car, over the phone (call any mechanic and try it, they will say "bring it in so I can look at it")
[08:49:57] <wood_quinn> So I'm using -current and I have a problem. How do I fix it and what's causing it?

[08:50:53] <wood_quinn> Ok.
[08:51:00] <Urchlay> that looks perfectly normal
[08:51:11] <KaMii> curious question, did you try running netconfig ?
[08:51:16] <wood_quinn> So your problem is that the "IPv6 only" network is giving you an IPv4 address?
[08:51:28] <yskapell> Yes
[08:51:29] <wood_quinn> Looks to me like you don't have an IPv6 network.
[08:51:32] <Urchlay> "sending IPv6 router solicitation" means it *tried* to get an IPv6 address... doesn't mean it actually got one
[08:51:53] <yskapell> inet6 fe80::b6b5:2fff:fe35:xxxxx
[08:51:55] <Urchlay> are you in fact expecting an IPv6 address? or is that just a red herring?
[08:51:57] <yskapell> Like this?
[08:52:34] <Urchlay> yeah, the fe80:: is autogenerated (I have one too, and I definitely don't have/need IPv6 here)
[08:52:37] <KaMii> Urchlay: tag your it, im going back to reading more ra salvatore
[08:52:59] <Urchlay> KaMii: bonus point for reading, but you lose a couple for poor taste in authors
[08:53:54] yskapell (~yskapell@chello089173050035.chello.sk) left irc: Client Quit
[08:53:54] <Urchlay> yskapell: the router gave you an IPv4 address. Ignore the IPv6 stuff (it isn't relevant here, interfaces get a fe80:: address by default, it didn't get that from the router)
[08:54:09] <KaMii> Urchlay: you just have no idea how good he is
[08:54:11] <Urchlay> now, it gave you an IPv4 address you weren't expecting...
[08:54:30] <KaMii> because of RA salvatore, WoW happened, without him, we would not have a world of warcraft
[08:54:32] <Urchlay> KaMii: I read 4 or 5 of those forgotten realms books, eons ago.
[08:54:47] <Urchlay> you know what? if I'd known that in 1990, I would have shot the guy myself :)
[08:54:53] <KaMii> which ones, because he wrote like 30+
[08:55:01] <KaMii> Urchlay: noooooooooooooo
[08:55:04] <KaMii> your sooo mean
[08:55:19] <Urchlay> mostly ones about a drow elf who got kicked out of drow-land because he wasn't evil
[08:55:23] <Urchlay> with an unspellable name
[08:55:28] <Urchlay> (the elf, not the book)
[08:55:34] <KaMii> Urchlay: dont say anymore, you will ruin it for me
[08:55:37] <KaMii> drizzt
[08:55:38] <KaMii> yea
[08:55:40] <Urchlay> yeah, that
[08:55:44] <KaMii> him
[08:56:00] <wood_quinn> Moar constanants!
[08:56:02] <KaMii> well, i think Counterstrike and games like that are much worse than WoW
[08:56:55] <Urchlay> why? because you can actually *win* at counterstrike?
[08:57:07] <Urchlay> (without paying a monthly fee to keep playing?)
[08:57:43] <Urchlay> so the guy with the dhcpcd thing, disappeared
[08:57:54] <wood_quinn> Probably installing 14.0 lol.
[08:57:54] <Urchlay> wonder if that means he fixed it
[08:58:01] <KaMii> no, because counterstrike promotes war and violence
[08:58:04] <Urchlay> huh?
[08:58:12] <Urchlay> you fight and kill stuff in WoW, too
[08:58:19] <KaMii> its simulated war with graphics that make little kids shoot life like people
[08:58:25] <KaMii> Urchlay: but wow is totally different
[08:58:40] <KaMii> you cant kill someone with a conjured fireball in real life
[08:58:47] <Urchlay> and just because there's violence in a game, doesn't mean it *promotes* violence, or *causes* it. And you know this perfectly well, you're trolling me.
[08:58:50] <Urchlay> you can with a sword
[08:58:50] <wood_quinn> Of course you can!
[08:59:22] <KaMii> Urchlay: well thats how i view it, sorry if you think its a troll thing, but im just against those kinds of games
[09:00:05] <Urchlay> "against" in what way? you won't play them? great (your choice). If you write letters to your congressman trying to get them banned though, eh, then I've got a problem with you
[09:00:25] <KaMii> no, i just dont play them or buy them
[09:00:40] <KaMii> its your write to make them or play them, but that company isnt making money off me

[09:01:56] <Urchlay> honestly it seems completely silly to me, to judge whether a game is good based on criteria like that
[09:02:08] <KaMii> the problem with those war simulators, theres no context, its just war for the sake of war, in real life, at least theres a reason for the war, usually some resource (the spice must flow) but idk if this makes sense
[09:02:25] <Urchlay> but... it's not real. Nobody gets hurt.
[09:02:45] <KaMii> psychologically??? idk, maybe some cannot distinguish reality from fantasy
[09:02:51] <Skywise> nah
[09:03:02] <Skywise> simulated combat is fun
[09:03:04] <KaMii> maybe that only heightens their anger and agression
[09:03:11] <Urchlay> I get pissed off at work, I come home and blow away legions of nazis on the computer, I feel better. Without actually hurting anyone (except myself: the time I wasted playing a game could have been spent on something constructive)
[09:03:23] <Skywise> pitting your skills against other humans is much more challenging then playing the AI
[09:03:24] <KaMii> if its fun, then why do they always get mad when they die and throw things?
[09:03:41] <Skywise> because they're dysfunctional
[09:03:48] <KaMii> isnt everyone?
[09:03:51] <Skywise> no
[09:04:02] <KaMii> idk, i just dont like them
[09:04:06] <Urchlay> in fact, in WoW, you actually can (sort-of) harm another real person: you can kill their WoW character. Death isn't permanent in that game, but it's definitely annoying, right?
[09:04:08] <KaMii> i dont see the point of it
[09:04:11] <Skywise> the games don't make anyone as they are, people are attracted to the games for their own reason
[09:04:19] <Skywise> then the game isn't for you
[09:04:26] <Skywise> but that doesn't mean no one else should like it either
[09:04:44] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea its annoying if they stalk you, but thats against the rules on the server I play
[09:04:46] <Urchlay> KaMii: what about chess? it's "simulated medieval warfare", does it make people violent?
[09:04:48] <Skywise> i don't see the point of the sims
[09:05:01] <KaMii> omfg
[09:05:05] <Skywise> who wants to boss every little detail of a simulated life
[09:05:27] <KaMii> chess has no graphics of life sized people getting blown away by real life weapons on a simulated screen
[09:05:37] <Skywise> depends on which game you play
[09:05:40] <KaMii> Skywise: there is sims 3 you know
[09:05:43] <Urchlay> life sized? you got a big damn screen?
[09:05:49] <wood_quinn> Who wants to piddle with more details in a simulated life than you conciously have to deal with in real life.
[09:05:49] <Skywise> yeah, they're still boring
[09:05:58] <KaMii> maybe not life size but realistic looking
[09:06:02] <Skywise> i like simcity
[09:06:08] <KaMii> idk im just against it
[09:06:09] <Skywise> but even that gets old
[09:06:17] <Skywise> yeah, but you only get to choose for yourself
[09:06:42] <KaMii> but i can voice my opinion
[09:06:44] <Skywise> i like playing wargames and would never be a threat to the public if i played them or not
[09:07:04] <Urchlay> yeah, be against it (and I'll think it's silly, but harmless), but don't try to make it illegal (then you'll be harming me by trying to infringe on my freedom)
[09:07:06] <Skywise> people who are dangerous are likely to like games that simulate danger as well
[09:07:22] <KaMii> Urchlay: i never said it should be illegal, i said the opposite
[09:07:30] <Skywise> but the game doesn't cause anything cause millions of people play them and there aren't millions of mass murderers
[09:07:44] <KaMii> sure there are
[09:07:48] <Skywise> theres not even dozens
[09:07:50] <KaMii> its called amies of the world
[09:07:51] <KaMii> lol
[09:07:54] <KaMii> armies even
[09:07:54] <Urchlay> heh, I wanna hear what KaMii thinks of the grand theft auto games
[09:08:14] <Skywise> soldiers are killers, not murderers
[09:08:21] <KaMii> i played the gta 3 i think
[09:08:44] <KaMii> the one in liberty city
[09:08:46] <Urchlay> soldiers aren't mass murderers. Maybe the leaders who started the war are, but the guys doing the fighting are *fighting* (if they don't kill the enemy, they get killed themselves, what would you do?)
[09:08:51] <KaMii> i liked driving the cars around
[09:08:57] <wood_quinn> Murder is the unlawful killing of someone else, and regardless of what you think of the military, most of the killing they do is lawful.
[09:09:01] <Skywise> soldiers fight other soldiers
[09:09:10] <KaMii> Urchlay: at least in gta there is a story and a context to the whole thing
[09:09:33] <Skywise> people play the game for the action
[09:09:34] <KaMii> so Urchlay if they made a simulated rape or child sex game, would that be ok?
[09:10:01] <Skywise> well not under us law, but i don't really see a problem with it, especially cause its imaginary
[09:10:16] <Skywise> its not something i'd want, but i don't think the world should be limited to my tastes
[09:10:20] <KaMii> im not talking legally, but morally or ethically
[09:10:24] <KaMii> where is the line?
[09:10:28] <Urchlay> KaMii: would it be OK? I dunno. Would I stay friends with someone I found out liked such a game? no
[09:10:32] <Skywise> i don't think there is a definitive line
[09:10:34] <wood_quinn> Exposure to things doesn't create behaviors.
[09:10:47] <wood_quinn> Unless you're only exposed to one thing.
[09:10:48] <KaMii> wood_quinn: sure it does
[09:10:51] <wood_quinn> And nothing else.

[09:11:36] <Urchlay> but... go to a bookstore. Look how many books there are about war (fiction and non). Obviously lots of people are interested in the subject. Doesn't mean they're all killers.

[09:11:48] <Skywise> people usually just such lines just on the other side of themselves, so they're on the good side
[09:11:58] <KaMii> for me the line is life like war games, the halo stuff doesnt count because you are killering made up aliens, but these medal of honor type games and the lets kill off this one group of people because we hate them.. yea, i dont like it
[09:12:22] <Urchlay> OTOH, there are no books about raping little kids (there are books about how baby rapers got caught maybe, but there are none that portray the act in a positive light)
[09:12:24] <KaMii> Urchlay: i know, but books are a lot different than a video game
[09:12:35] <Skywise> well thats an arbitrary line, but you also get to play both sides
[09:12:39] <KaMii> Urchlay: umm, ever read brave new world?
[09:12:47] <KaMii> thats pretty much 200 pages of child sex
[09:12:50] <Skywise> i heard about it
[09:13:18] <KaMii> ok im exaggerating a little, but theres a whole lot of child sex in that book
[09:13:21] <Urchlay> yeah, OK, that would be because Huxley was a perv who did too much acid. An outlier, not part of the bell curve.
[09:13:39] <KaMii> i told my teacher the same thing
[09:13:45] <KaMii> i got sent to the principals office
[09:13:53] <Urchlay> there's in fact a "War" section in the Barnes & Noble down the street from here. There is no "Child Sex" section.
[09:14:21] <KaMii> because in the usa war is ok, but sex and love is wrong

[09:14:50] <KaMii> im sure there are innocents in those games
[09:15:00] <KaMii> ive seen them in other games before
[09:15:03] <wood_quinn> Which would you prefer?
[09:15:07] <KaMii> neither
[09:15:16] <wood_quinn> Realistic games that portray the horror of war, or games that pretty it up?
[09:15:20] <Skywise> in wargames you get points for killing

[09:15:32] <Skywise> but when i play those games, i have the gore turned off
[09:15:40] <Urchlay> KaMii: ever played Blood? there are civilians in that game who beg you "Please don't hurt me!", and you can kill them... you get no points for doing it, but everyone does it anyway
[09:15:49] <KaMii> Skywise: yea, i dont like that, im ok with a rts war game
[09:15:53] <KaMii> because the point is strategy
[09:15:58] <KaMii> but i dont see the point of a FPS
[09:16:03] <Skywise> those who like such things prolly have it turned up to the max, but it was a preference before they played the game, not because they played the game
[09:16:20] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea, that game and those postal games
[09:16:34] <Skywise> lots of people like to go to gory movies
[09:16:46] <KaMii> i know, but it doesnt mean its right
[09:16:52] <Skywise> i don't, but you wanna talk life size
[09:16:54] <KaMii> romans loved the collesseum
[09:16:59] <wood_quinn> When I play videogames, I do the right thing, even though it's just a game.
[09:17:03] <Urchlay> yeah, and most of the fans of Freddy or Jason (or those stupid Saw moview) aren't killers
[09:17:05] <Skywise> yeah, they did, i think its rather depraved
[09:17:18] <KaMii> i refuse to watch saw
[09:17:19] <wood_quinn> It's a predisposition to moral conduct that I have, regardless of the videogame character's context.
[09:17:20] <Urchlay> in the colosseum, actual people suffered & died
[09:17:28] <Skywise> but the killers are the problem, not the things the killer does
[09:17:35] <KaMii> i do not need to watch a movie about mindless torture
[09:17:40] <KaMii> that is not entertainment for me
[09:17:51] <Skywise> me neither, i don't see the attraction
[09:17:54] <wood_quinn> Well, it's a semantic point, but Saw isn't about mindless torture until the later movies.
[09:18:00] <Skywise> but i'm not gonna stop anyone from watching it either
[09:18:00] <KaMii> whats next, is the us government going to make their own movie and call it 'Waterboard'
[09:18:10] <wood_quinn> It's a dying psychopath that wants to see people's will to live.

[09:23:07] <KaMii> you cant eat it, it doesnt exist
[09:23:09] <KaMii> its just a hole
[09:23:13] <Skywise> yes you can
[09:23:17] <Urchlay> you're Swedish, you make donuts without holes, then shoot holes in them (it must be true, I saw it on the muppet show!)

[09:34:46] <TommyC> So...I didn't feel like installing wget for simple "wget <somefiletodownload>", but I dislike using "curl <link> -o <filename>" so I aliased wget to: "curl $1 -o $(echo $1 | rev | cut -f 1 -d "/" | rev)" <-- decent replacement, or stupid? opinions?
[09:34:49] <Skywise> yeah, what are they thinking
[09:35:19] <Urchlay> I wouldn't call the alias "wget"
[09:35:37] <Skywise> its 4 in the morning, i'm not even trying to think about code
[09:35:40] <Urchlay> cget maybe, or cwget
[09:35:50] <Skywise> i think maybe sandwichget
[09:36:00] <Urchlay> 4:30... best time to think about code.
[09:36:12] <Skywise> i wish i had a cinnamon bun
[09:36:13] <Urchlay> sudo make me a sandwich
[09:37:35] <Urchlay> why wouldn't you want to install wget though? it's not exactly huge
[09:38:10] <Skywise> i like how quiet everything gets when its foggy
[09:38:36] <TommyC> Urchlay: I just didn't want it if curl can do the same thing.
[09:38:43] <TommyC> (and more)
[09:38:45] <Skywise> i think i'ma eat a can of beefaroni
[09:39:12] <Urchlay> can curl do stuff like... wget -r -l3 -nH -np --cut-dirs=3 http://whatever?
[09:39:48] <Skywise> yeah, you didn't think about that, did you
[09:39:57] <Urchlay> that's something I use pretty often actually
[09:40:22] <Urchlay> e.g. to download all the files in the source/ap/foo/ directory on a slackware mirror
[09:40:22] <Skywise> i bet its amazing
[09:40:28] <Skywise> i see
[09:41:28] <Urchlay> no I don't type all that crap, I wrote a script
[09:41:46] <TommyC> I'd probably just use lftp for that.

[09:43:32] <Urchlay> I just don't see a problem with having all the above installed... curl, wget, lftp... why not?
[09:43:45] <Urchlay> (I never even use curl from the command line, but some stuff uses libcurl.so)
[09:44:14] <TommyC> I primarily use wget like: "wget foo" so I thought, but I do use curl a lot more interactively in scripts and stuff (and I know curl can also download files), so I thought: "why not just use curl?"
[09:44:28] pnpuff (~Eternit@unaffiliated/pnpuff) left ##slackware.
[09:44:40] <Urchlay> answer: because wget's easier to use, for that use case
[09:45:38] <TommyC> that's why I aliased it to curl. ^_^
[09:46:03] <Urchlay> yeah, but calling something wget that ain't wget seems like it'll lead to confusion/annoyance later
[09:46:04] <TommyC> I just didn't feel the real need to use wget.
[09:46:50] <Urchlay> (but YMMV, vim is called vi on all my boxen, and I'm OK with that)
[09:50:44] <TommyC> I don't think I have any scripts that actually use wget extensively. I don't use slackpkg, and I know that uses wget. So afaik, I think I got everything.
[09:51:32] <Urchlay> scripts don't see aliases anyway
[09:52:21] <Urchlay> (one reason I tend to use scripts for everything, instead of aliases)

[10:15:55] <Skywise> yeah, it was creepy
[10:15:57] <Urchlay> wonder if you could actually watch the rapid eye movement when she was dreaming
[10:16:26] <Urchlay> (but if she woke up & caught you staring into her eyes, she'd probably you creepy...)

[10:24:33] tribeca (~naitso@151.71.144.34) joined ##slackware.
[10:25:01] <Urchlay> avoid bash-ism is one of those theoretical things. It's good to know a bashism when you see it but... on slackware, /bin/sh will always be bash anyway
[10:25:21] <Urchlay> I mean Pat uses bash arrays in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1
[10:25:34] <TommyC> YEah, and on distros that has /bin/bash symlinked ot /bin/sh, bash won't use bash-isms
[10:25:36] <Urchlay> (and he won't change the shebang line to #!/bin/bash either)
[10:25:38] <TommyC> but on SW it does, not quite sure why
[10:25:46] <Urchlay> because that isn't exactly true
[10:25:50] <TommyC> luckily Slackware ships with /bin/ash.
[10:25:59] <Skywise> slackware is best cause its pure of heart
[10:27:16] <Urchlay> there's no way to invoke bash so it will ignore its own syntax. If other distros are really doing that, then they're either using a different shell for /bin/sh (maybe even a differently-compiled bash, with extended syntax disabled), or they've done some invasive patching to their bash sources
[10:28:18] <Urchlay> eh, or anyway that's my understanding of it. Plenty of things I don't know though.
[10:28:32] <Skywise> its pretty esoteric
[10:29:25] <TommyC> the #bash channel people said symlinking /bin/sh to /bin/bash should have the effect of removing bashisms, but I told them it doesn't in slackware and then I got yelled at so I left.
[10:29:49] <Urchlay> eh, that sounds like they don't know as much as they think
[10:30:03] <Urchlay> I've gotten that in lots of app- or language-specific IRC channels
[10:30:25] <Urchlay> they always go "we don't support slackware" or "why are you using that broken crap?" or something
[10:30:27] <Skywise> well you can't expect them to know about specific distros
[10:30:31] <Urchlay> no, but
[10:30:40] <Urchlay> I'm pretty sure slackware's behavior is the default
[10:30:54] <Urchlay> as in, if you were to get the bash sources and compile them with no patching
[10:31:01] <TommyC> Urchlay: Nah they didn't do that because bash is bash.
[10:31:08] <Skywise> slackware is a respectable distro
[10:31:34] <Skywise> some people don't seem to understand why you don't wanna run pam cause you're running slackware

[10:33:55] <Urchlay> TommyC: nope. This was years before that

[10:34:49] <Urchlay> the 16-bit-ness of those windows exes turned out to be a red herring anyway
[10:35:11] <Skywise> what was  the issue
[10:35:38] <Urchlay> it was the fact that they wanted to mmap and write to low addresses in their address space
[10:35:49] <Skywise> oh i remember that
[10:36:24] <Urchlay> putting 'vm.mmap_min_addr = 0' fixes it completely, but might cause nastiness with null pointer dereferences. "vm.mmap_min_addr = 4096" fixes it for every app I tested (which was only maybe 5)
[10:36:43] <Skywise> thats the thing with windows, you would have to do a work around so often you didn't know what you were really breaking or not
[10:37:03] <Urchlay> I kinda wonder if those same apps would have problems on modern windows
[10:37:07] <Skywise> sometimes you just had to do things by superstition because the api was so poorly documented or the documents were just plain wrong
[10:37:19] <Urchlay> (well, if they were 16-bit, I guess they just wouldn't run. But it can affect 32-bit stuff too)
[10:37:39] <Skywise> windows tends to keep all its baggage
[10:38:05] <Skywise> it would be easy enough to test, but to be honest, win7 breaks xp programs so i wouldn't give it much of a chance
[10:40:46] <Urchlay> I thought recent windows finally ditched 16-bit compatibility
[10:41:13] <Urchlay> win7 can't run stuff that was compiled for XP/earlier at all? or it runs poorly?
[10:41:16] <Skywise> it could be
[10:41:36] <Tomi_E> oh it will run xp stuff
[10:41:42] <Skywise> it has an xp compatibility mode, but somethings still has trouble
[10:41:52] <Tomi_E> just not too well on the home version
[10:42:39] <Skywise> i'm sure theres some undocumented calls and erratic behavior they didn't implement

[10:50:46] <Urchlay> if DOS had grown preemptive (or even coop) multitasking, virtual memory, 32-bit flat address space, and such, *before* it grew a GUI, the driver problem would have been less of a big deal
[10:51:28] <Skywise> dos was an afterthough done on a weekend
[10:51:54] <Urchlay> you'd have had 5 GUI shells that ran on top of DOS, and you'd only have needed a DOS driver for everything (and Windows would have stayed a shell that ran on top of DOS)
[10:52:37] libertas (~libertas@87.196.238.173) joined ##slackware.
[10:52:59] <Urchlay> but then, I guess they could have just used UNIX... Microsoft used to sell their own (Xenix, right?) but the hardware didn't support it real well I've heard
[10:54:09] <Skywise> nothing ran on it either
[10:54:22] <Urchlay> likely not
[10:54:55] <Urchlay> but if they'd developed windows as a GUI layer for Xenix, presumably that would have made them happy (it would run windows but not much else)
[10:55:55] <Urchlay> I kinda wish OS/2 had gotten a little more widespread, I never got the chance to mess with it until after it was basically dead
[10:57:07] <Skywise> ugh, it was a nightmare especially with ps/2s and you always needed a special version of everything for it
[10:57:46] <Skywise> it was a giant pain in the butt, it never really performed any better then windows
[10:57:54] <Urchlay> ...thing about DOS was... compared to CP/M, or the OS/DOS for stuff like the Apple II (which the PC was originally competing against), DOS was pretty nice actually
[10:58:54] <Urchlay> they just should have kept developing it (into something like the NT kernel + a command shell, maybe)
[11:00:06] <KaMii> what was the compiler used to create dos?

[11:01:14] <cmyster> idk
[11:02:13] <Urchlay> "I'm 40% Fortran, baby!"
[11:02:36] <cmyster> its fortran and assembly iirc
[11:02:42] <Urchlay> (if you add up all the things that make up 40% of Bender, you get a number much bigger than 100...)

[11:05:44] <cmyster> thats binary
[11:06:12] <Urchlay> assembly source is human-readable (though not very, compared to higher-level languages). Go look at that link & see.

[11:08:18] <KaMii> so what does LDA ICBAL, Y
[11:08:47] <cmyster> I have no idea, I learned it for my BA 11 years ago :)
[11:08:48] <Urchlay> LDA means "load accumulator". ICBAL is an address. ", Y" means to add the contents of Y to the address
[11:08:49] <wed> Check out MenuetOS.net
[11:09:17] <Urchlay> so in English, load the accumulator with the data located at address (Y + ICBAL)
[11:09:20] <KaMii> so you had to try to remember each address and code for it?

[11:09:59] <Tomi_E> its better then hand programing a computer with wire and winding it though ferrite cores.
[11:10:00] <Urchlay> the address, was defined elsewhere in the source

[11:10:55] <Urchlay> Tomi_E: I'm not old enough to remember doing that, but I've heard stories... someone told me IBM programmers weren't even allowed to use color-coded wire (it was all black insulation)
[11:12:11] <Urchlay> KaMii: you should try to wrap your mind around assembly language (not the stuff I linked, something people still use, like x86 or arm). You'll learn a lot, if you spend the time.

[11:29:57] <Urchlay> actually they don't sell anything specifically for this bass (it's a Fender JP-90, only made for a year or so), but it'd be easy enough to replace the thing
[11:30:22] <Urchlay> can't just file off the sharp bits, they're tiny allen-head screws that you use the adjust the string height (kind of important!)
[11:31:21] <Tomi_E> well theres plenty of options... ohhh yeah i have a guitar that has that issue too, and i played a bass like that i know that pain
[11:32:07] <Urchlay> got a Schaller roller bridge that's not doing anything important, but there's not enough room to mount it (the body's about 1/2" too short, in the back)
[11:32:30] <Urchlay> the schaller's on a crappy squire bass... the bridge cost more than the rest of the bass did :)

[11:43:09] <Urchlay> been trying to straighten out the neck on this acoustic guitar here... turning the trussrod doesn't seem to *do* anything. Think it has to go to a real luthier.

[11:45:39] <Urchlay> been an hour since then and it still doesn't look/feel any different. I haven't got a capo or a set of feeler gauges so I can't tell if the string height has changed at all (but if it has, it's too little to detect just by playing it)
[11:46:08] <Skywise> are you supposed to tune it and then take the bend out of the neck?
[11:46:14] <Urchlay> nah
[11:46:19] <Tomi_E> some times the luthier will put the neck in a jig and help it along with the straighten it out... but thats something i would not try far too risky
[11:46:51] <Urchlay> you need *some* bend in the neck, or else when you e.g. fret a low note, the string will also touch the higher frets (makes it buzz or actually play a high note)

[11:47:14] <Urchlay> Tomi_E: that's not an option here anyway. No space to set up such a jig even if I knew how
[11:47:25] <Urchlay> my "workbench" is the bed I'll be sleeping in later
[11:47:38] <Skywise> can you adjust the nut to keep it from touching like that?
[11:47:58] <Urchlay> normally you don't want to do anything to the nut
[11:48:18] <Urchlay> you could make the nut shorter (by filing it down), but you'd have to make a new one to make it higher
[11:48:46] <Skywise> how is the nut attached
[11:49:02] <Urchlay> glue
[11:49:07] <Tomi_E> Urchlay: have a luthier take a look at it first and have them make the adjustment if it breaks they have to fix it ^^
[11:49:16] <Urchlay> but pretty weak glue, easy to remove (but I'm not going to)
[11:49:17] <Skywise> so you glue the nut to the neck and head?
[11:49:31] <KaMii> that just sounds wrong
[11:49:33] <Urchlay> the headstock's part of the neck actually
[11:49:35] <Skywise> or is there a slot in the neck it goes into
[11:49:41] <Skywise> ok
[11:49:44] <Urchlay> and yeah, there's a slot for the nut
[11:49:53] <Skywise> KaMii, go back to your porn
[11:50:02] <KaMii> lol
[11:50:06] <KaMii> hello kitty?
[11:50:06] <Tomi_E> KaMii: LOL
[11:50:13] <KaMii> or RA Salvatore?
[11:50:35] <Urchlay> but the nut isn't the issue here. If it were an electric guitar, it'd have string height adjusters, and I'd lower those. But it's an acousting (bridge is a piece of wood with a bone saddle, not adjustable without replacing the saddle)
[11:50:51] <KaMii> and just so you know, i dont read those dirty romance novels..... i write them, lol
[11:50:58] <Urchlay> "acousting"... that almost sounds like a real word
[11:51:12] <Skywise> is the bridge held in place by friction like a violin?
[11:51:18] <Urchlay> the saddle is
[11:51:24] <Skywise> k
[11:51:33] <Tomi_E> Urchlay: you shure its not a slide guitar?
[11:51:36] <Urchlay> the bridge (the wooden piece the saddle sits in) is glued down
[11:51:38] <KaMii> Urchlay: making a nyckelharpa?
[11:52:01] <Urchlay> Tomi_E: it would work for slide. But, it's not a dobro or anything
[11:52:23] <Urchlay> KaMii: Can't afford to. How bout a pennyharpa?
[11:52:36] <KaMii> might be fun
[11:53:18] <Urchlay> Tomi_E: it's mostly playable the way it is. Before I changed strings, it was about perfect
[11:53:54] <Urchlay> (the old strings were .010, I replaced with .012 because the old ones felt like wet noodles & weren't very loud)
[11:54:02] <Tomi_E> ohhhh what strings did you use? what size?
[11:54:32] <Tomi_E> ahh i see
[11:54:40] <Urchlay> CF Martin phosphor bronze. They call a .012 set "medium light", I'd hate to try to play their heavy gauge
[11:54:46] <KaMii> he uses a G string
[11:54:47] <KaMii> hahaha
[11:55:45] <Tomi_E> KaMii: i tune my G string to a F flat
[11:56:01] <Urchlay> ...which is less kinky than it sounds
[11:56:33] <KaMii> it didnt sound at all sexy
[11:56:37] <Urchlay> actually, hm, maybe I'll tune the whole thing down a full step & see if the action's any better that way
[11:57:50] <Urchlay> what would you call a guitar designed to be tuned that way? baritone guitar's BEADF#B, this would be DGCFAD
[11:58:17] <Tomi_E> metal guitars lol jk jk
[11:58:32] <Urchlay> acoustic guitars suck at sounding metal

[12:59:42] <BrokenCog> anyone know how to build just libperl.so ? slack14 installed perl, but for some reason on only one machine irssi complains about libperl.so not being found - which isn't on the drive evidently ?? ...  I'd rather not build all of perl to get one lib ...
[13:00:12] <TheM4ch1n3> Demon_Fox: yes
[13:00:55] <WildWizard> BrokenCog: Are these supposed to be identical installs of Slackware?
[13:01:39] <BrokenCog> I think they are ... something must have removed the lib on the one machine, but i don't know what would have.
[13:02:41] <WildWizard> Maybe maybe not ... the slackware installer has a nasty problem when it encounters damaged files while installing, it doesn't give you an error to let you know it broke
[13:02:53] <pprkut> reinstall perl
[13:02:55] <WildWizard> I suggest reinstalling the perl package

[16:31:13] <Jdogzz> I will give them that even in Slackware, kernel upgrades do break every now and then. They disabled my radeon driver in the new release:(
[16:31:19] <Jdogzz> *broadcom (no sleep)
[16:34:02] <hpg> Jdogzz, well, that's not the fault of the kernel, but the fault of AMD respectively Broadcom
[16:34:53] <Jdogzz> It was just the broadcom driver actually, wrote radeon for no reason. But wouldn't that be the fault of the kernel maintainers because it wasn't removed, it was just disabled?
[16:35:23] <Jdogzz> If I compile my own kernel, which I will have to do again one of these days, I can get the functionality back (hopefully), but as is, no good.
[16:36:33] <ananke> also wouldn't be the first time kernel changes impact things. just on friday i had to patch code to a set of drivers, because of multiple changes that took place throughout some of the 2.6.x kernels
[16:37:57] <ananke> for example, wtf would they change the name of a function from pci_find_device to pci_get_device, when everything remained the same
[16:38:18] <Jdogzz> Right, that sort of stuff gets a little annoying.
[16:38:58] <Jdogzz> But, I shouldn't complain if I'm not willing to do anything about it:) I want to get into kernel contributions eventually, do my part.

[17:23:26] <cmyster> not too sure, but iirc non 0 is bad and is the sum of a few conditions, so 133 can be 128 + 4 + 1

[17:53:07] <TommyC> Morning everybody, quick query: the glibc package can't be used to break out of a chroot, correct?

[19:37:39] <BrokenCog> port 20 on the client .. as the link talks about :).
[19:37:50] <ananke> that's why ftp sucks. too bad it's such a common protocol. for serving files http is a much better issue

[23:16:02] <James-C12> Hello.  I want to install slackware with a minimal install.  I install only the base system and the network group of packages.  But when I boot into slackware I can't seem to get eth0 to work.  I configured using the pkgtool to static, and dhcp.  No luck.  so my question is.  While installing I'm starting to assume that I need some libraries or something that I didn't select.  Would that be the cause?

[23:18:38] <James-C12> Okay I knew the package manager didn't resolve dependicies but I didn't realize the install also didn't double check out as well.   I guess I got some reading todo.  I just want a minimal install with the pkg tools basic tcp/ip networking and wget.
[23:19:28] <James-C12> I guess I was under the impression that the package manager would atleast warn you about needed packages/libraries

[23:48:03] <James-C12> and to be honest.  I'm going back to slackware from Ubuntu because if I have to spend all the time uninstalling all the BS the install by default and totally reconfiguring the system why not go with slackware.  You have to do it anyways right ;)
[23:48:36] <TommyC> You could just use a tagfile and skip what you don't want installed.
[23:48:36] <James-C12> The purks.  You don't have to uninstall everything first
[23:48:37] <KaMii> James-C12: then why dont you use gentoo?
[23:48:48] <James-C12> never used it
[23:49:02] <KaMii> or arch
[23:49:34] <ananke> doesn't ubuntu server have a default selection for minimal install?
[23:49:40] pale3 (~marko@89-201-209-232.dsl.optinet.hr) joined ##slackware.
[23:49:56] <adaptr> it doesn't have any other options.
[23:49:58] <James-C12> oh I'm talking about desktops now.
[23:50:06] <James-C12> I used Debian or CentOS for server
[23:50:17] <adaptr> you can select sets of packages for some of the most common uses, e.g. LAMP, SSH, etc. the rest is all manual.
[23:50:38] <adaptr> so a "minimal install" would be not selecting any of those sets of packages.
[23:50:40] <KaMii> i thought you said earlier that this slack boxen is going to be a server?
[23:50:51] <adaptr> although that excludes openssh, which is just plain idiotic.
[23:50:53] <James-C12> Oh yea this one about to install on

[23:52:23] <macavity> pale3: quit bouncing...
[23:52:41] <adaptr> ananke: not including SSH by default ? yes, it is. and yet, Ubuntu delivers once more.
[23:53:06] <KaMii> anyone ever try to see if you can get tts to work in irssi?
[23:53:16] Action: adaptr is waiting for Incomprehensible Idiot, v.44.04, which will not have shells.
[23:53:21] <James-C12> yea I remember once I order a vps a couple years ago and selected a minimal install.  LOL the install was so minimal I couldn't do nothing with it.
[23:53:36] <James-C12> not remotely anyways
[23:53:37] <adaptr> "do you want a package manager y/n"
[23:54:39] <pale3> macavity: sorry, i am in the middle of testing something.
[23:55:10] <macavity> James-C12: handy tip: slackware has a statically compiled version of tar in its installer invironment, and packages are relative to / so all you gotta do is untar and run the /install/doinst.sh script and you are good to go

[23:55:53] <KaMii> macavity: is there a mindful bot?
[23:56:30] <James-C12> so the slackware packages are just tar archives then
