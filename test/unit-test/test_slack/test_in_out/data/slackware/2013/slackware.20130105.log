[01:26:19] Skywise (~noneya@unaffiliated/skywise) joined ##slackware.
[01:26:36] <Skywise> thats being overturned, people can discover genes, but they don't invent them
[01:27:43] <wood_quinn> Yeah.
[01:27:44] <KaMii> how can you patent a gene?  you find them, you dont make them
[01:27:46] <hplc> bottomline is.....if we have unravelled the human sourcecode, isnt it a mistake to NOT try and implement bugfixes?
[01:27:55] <KaMii> people that patent nature should gtfo
[01:28:00] <wood_quinn> Until we know 6.5 metric tons more about genetics.
[01:28:07] <xocel> slows down/stops research quite a bit. figuring out the function of a naturally occurring  gene, gives you the rights to patent that gene. which really needs to be fixed, a lot of researchers are rather annoyed about it obviously
[01:28:19] <KaMii> wood_quinn: paper books are heavey
[01:28:22] <wood_quinn> hplc: Mm no.
[01:28:37] <hplc> so gene-therapy is all wrong?
[01:28:47] Penguin_Metal (~mardin@82.145.35.133) left irc: Ping timeout: 248 seconds
[01:28:57] <Skywise> hplc, people used to think 1 gene coded for 1 protein, but its turns out its much more complicated then that and you can have many genes code for a protein or even alter the protein in production inresponse to outside factors
[01:29:01] <wood_quinn> Genetic manipulation will lead to problems and shouldn't be done.
[01:29:11] <Skywise> so its not really feasible to trigger genes and only have what you want to happen
[01:29:32] <wood_quinn> Best case scenario, you make a perfect race.
[01:29:32] <wood_quinn> Then what?
[01:29:38] <wood_quinn> Now you're all, for lack of a better way to put it, inbred.
[01:29:46] <wood_quinn> Genetic diversity is gone and we're all screwed.
[01:29:47] <KaMii> because they are all dictaters
[01:29:49] Penguin_Metal (~mardin@82.145.35.133) joined ##slackware.
[01:30:00] <KaMii> and they just want to micromanage your body
[01:30:04] <Skywise> you have to have genes that activate and regulate the activity
[01:30:04] <KaMii> dick-taters!!!!
[01:30:34] <wood_quinn> Unless of course you're part of Treadstone.
[01:30:35] <xocel> hplc, agreed, we should be bugfixing. Theres things that can be done a lot better also. The mole rat developed a crazy protein checking, resulting in its lifespan being hugely increased compared to other rodents. I want that.
[01:30:40] <wood_quinn> Then you just take two viruses and you're set.
[01:30:54] <wood_quinn> xocel: I don't.
[01:31:12] <wood_quinn> Mortality is what drives us to act.
[01:31:19] <KaMii> xocel: why?  so you can be a slave to the elite longer?
[01:31:23] <KaMii> suffer in poverty longer?
[01:31:30] <wood_quinn> Make us live for 300 years, and what's the point of doing anything until you're 200?
[01:31:32] <KaMii> work for some asshole to make him rich longer?
[01:31:45] <Skywise> i think eventually, they will be able to grow replacement organs, maybe even inside the body, but i think they'll always be using string and glue to close up the incision
[01:33:50] <hplc> odd, we constantly strive to impeove everything around us, crops, cellphones, communications etc etc, but improve humanity is still a "bad thing"
[01:34:03] <hplc> improve*
[01:34:08] <xocel> lol very valid points but personally i dont see things continuing to much longer as they are. Collapse is inevitable. I would like to see what happens after this shit heap :P
[01:34:17] <Skywise> thats cause no one agrees as to what an improvement would be
[01:34:38] <Skywise> blonde hair and blue eyes might be some's definition

[01:37:02] <wood_quinn> You just killed several small animals.
[01:38:00] <Skywise> the problem with whats best, and for the same reason survival of the fittest isn't true, is that its all dependent on specific situations
[01:38:09] <KaMii> xocel: whats a reaver?
[01:38:34] <Skywise> in a industrial society, is the poor and stupid who have more kids then the successful
[01:38:42] <wood_quinn> In the Firefly/Serenity universe a chemical was being tested by the government to make people better.
[01:38:53] <wood_quinn> In most cases it worked, agression was ruled out.
[01:39:09] <KaMii> firefly isnt true
[01:39:10] <wood_quinn> Then after a while people just started letting themselves die, and others became vicious animals.
[01:39:30] <wood_quinn> The point is, we're not all-knowing.
[01:39:39] <xocel> KaMii, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoXjUl5usKI
[01:39:40] <Skywise> with some moths near a coal burning factory, it was the ones who looked sooty that survived best, but when they cleaned up the plant and no longer spewed soot, the light colored moths became more successful
[01:39:52] <KaMii> i dont do youtube
[01:40:07] <wood_quinn> We didn't design ourselves, and until we know a heck of a lot more about ourselves, we shouldn't start *re*-designing.
[01:40:29] <Skywise> unintended consequences loom large
[01:40:54] <hplc> but gene manipulation of crops has turned out to produce more food in harsh environment?
[01:40:59] <Skywise> nah
[01:41:48] <Skywise> whats worked is they've tested certain genes for survivabilty and then those have be selected for and bred naturally

[01:52:58] <KaMii> have you guys read aldous huxleys, brave new world
[01:52:59] <wood_quinn> Marriage licenses lol.
[01:53:03] <Skywise> getting married all you can do is wreck your finances
[01:53:14] <Skywise> having kids you can wreck a whole lot more
[01:53:18] <KaMii> this is pretty much what he talks about, except for the whole child sex theme thats heavy through th book
[01:53:23] <wood_quinn> I'm not sure what the purpose of marriage licenses is to begin with.
[01:53:42] <wood_quinn> You can, and many people do, get legal agreements written up which do the same thing.
[01:53:47] <xocel> well, we have some serious shit to sort out before we start upgrading ourselves(society being broken and all). but in an actual genctioning society. i would prefer to go down the genetics route then cybernetics. cybernetics is gone once the civilzation making it collapses, genetics stays with us forever.
[01:53:52] <wood_quinn> People who intend to be long term roomates and such.
[01:53:58] <xocel> functioning*
[01:54:06] <Skywise> well, i think it was first as documentatio
[01:54:14] <Skywise> then it somehow got turned in to approval
[01:54:22] <wood_quinn> xocel: Cybernetics is soo much moar cyberpunk though.
[01:54:50] <Skywise> no, the thing with cyberntics is have you seen how well mechanical things we make last?
[01:54:58] <hplc> virtual reality never became a reality, except for car manufacturers
[01:55:00] <wood_quinn> Skywise: Well there's one recent (recent? recent enough) development in society that has pretty much tried to use legalization as a battering ram into social acceptance.
[01:55:07] <wood_quinn> A development I won't name.
[01:55:15] <Skywise> if they're anything like our cars, your artifcial body will always be in the shop and you'll spend your time as a head in a jar
[01:55:21] <wood_quinn> Skywise: Yeah.
[01:55:28] <wood_quinn> We need steam powered cybernetics.
[01:55:31] <wood_quinn> Problem: Solved.
[01:55:33] <Skywise> lol
[01:55:35] <wood_quinn> That crap lasts forever.
[01:55:58] <KaMii> and since most people are full of hot air....
[01:56:26] <Skywise> i bet the bodies will be covered with sponors tatoos cause no one will be able to afford them on their own
[01:56:53] <KaMii> Skywise: already happened, ever hear of a tatoo?
[01:56:54] gnisho (~dac@67-5-107-227.spok.qwest.net) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[01:57:08] <wood_quinn> Tattoos lol.
[01:57:23] <Skywise> yeah now it instead of mom it will say Shell
[01:57:27] <KaMii> then they made all thosse stupid reality tatoo shows...
[01:57:31] <KaMii> and tatoos went on the rise
[01:57:43] <wood_quinn> When you can't achieve personality, put a mark on your body!
[01:57:46] <Skywise> the stupid are very impressionable
[01:58:10] <KaMii> yea, oh look i got these chinese symbols tatooed on me
[01:58:16] <Skywise> i never saw the point of getting something drawn on you that you could put on a t-shirt
[01:58:25] <Skywise> that don't even mean anything
[01:58:35] <KaMii> i have no idea what it says, but the tatoo artist that dropped out of grade school says it means love peace and firtility

[01:58:41] <KaMii> and he would never lie
[01:59:04] <Skywise> yeah, i heard about one guy getting a tatoo in kanjii that said wife beater
[01:59:18] <Skywise> apparently he was really unpopular with the ladies in japan
[01:59:50] <KaMii> i saw an american guy that got a bunch of tatoos with swedish words, lets just say, it wasnt nice what was written, and he had no idea what it meant
[01:59:53] <KaMii> he just thought it looked cool
[01:59:57] <Skywise> he thought it meant powerful warrier
[02:00:03] <wood_quinn> val
[02:00:06] <wood_quinn> Done win.
[02:00:10] <KaMii> no
[02:00:25] <xocel>  depends, people get tattoos for different reasons. Some to be 'cool', others have more meaning, more personal, feats of accomplishment and such
[02:00:41] <wood_quinn> Why get a tat when you can get a big ass gold chain with an emblem on it?
[02:00:48] <wood_quinn> 'come society.
[02:00:49] <KaMii> if the tatoo has a spiritual meaning or some form of deep meaning, im all for it
[02:01:02] <Skywise> nah, i don't like 'em
[02:01:03] <KaMii> but these people that are getting, just get them for shits and giggles
[02:01:03] <wood_quinn> Ink under the skin, meaningful.
[02:01:04] <wood_quinn> Ah yes.
[02:01:18] <Skywise> its like putting footprints on fresh snow
[02:01:19] <wood_quinn> It's to be different.
[02:01:33] <KaMii> wood_quinn: you saving up for that gold capped tooth?
[02:01:33] <wood_quinn> Because obviously without tats we're all the same person.
[02:01:37] <wood_quinn> Just look at Skywise and me.
[02:01:42] <wood_quinn> Practically the same person.
[02:01:50] <wood_quinn> Then I got my phalus tat.
[02:01:52] <Skywise> except for the spelling
[02:01:57] <wood_quinn> Totally can tell us apart now.
[02:02:05] <wood_quinn> ogod that was bad.
[02:02:06] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[02:02:13] <hplc> it didnt stop with tatoos, then came piecieng, just a new form of stainless steel implants, no function, just for fun, i believe there a desire to evolve, if not thru genetics then by cybernetics, ppl always want to have an edge over the masses
[02:02:27] <Skywise> yeah i think the horns are really lame
[02:02:36] <wood_quinn> Tribal people had tats and peircings.
[02:02:46] <wood_quinn> They did it to look "cool."
[02:02:51] <Skywise> and people put balls under their foreskin
[02:02:53] <wood_quinn> Or to scare the shit out of enimies.
[02:03:01] <KaMii> well ear piercings in girls is acceptable
[02:03:11] <Skywise> i never liked that much
[02:03:12] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Yeah... there's taste in that.
[02:03:17] <Skywise> why not clipons
[02:03:18] <KaMii> Skywise: i thought people cut off the foreskin
[02:03:21] <wood_quinn> But even then you can go too far.
[02:03:27] <Skywise> they do that too

[02:04:24] <wood_quinn> And as of yet, I haven't heard any concrete evidence that it causes harm.
[02:04:25] <Skywise> yeah, i'm not really so sure its a necessary surgery
[02:04:32] <KaMii> therse no medical benefits to circumcision
[02:04:34] <NyteOwl> No not new. I've been here since this actually WAS a channel about Slackware
[02:04:41] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Oh... yes there is lol.
[02:04:41] <xocel> the maori here used tattoos as identification, a moku on their chin, which was essentially a photo id on your face, my name is this, i belong to this tribe, blah blah blah. so when you ran into some random in the bush, you knew whether you could eat them or not XD
[02:04:42] <NyteOwl> anyway, ttfn
[02:05:00] <wood_quinn> If you've ever been a parent of a infant male you know one specific benefit lol.
[02:05:23] <KaMii> wood_quinn: clean it
[02:05:30] <wood_quinn> You have to, for months, pull the foreskin back over the infant's head so that it doesn't close.
[02:05:30] <KaMii> if your that bad of a parent you should have kids
[02:05:33] <hplc> NyteOwl i tried slack-talk, didnt trigger much of a discussion :S
[02:05:36] <Skywise> since the invention of soap and water, i don't think removing it is really needed
[02:05:50] <wood_quinn> And if you forget, lol, welcome to screaming in-pain baby land.
[02:06:06] <wood_quinn> Skywise: Honestly, since the invention of underwear leaving it hasn't been needed.
[02:06:18] <Skywise> all the way over its head? yea, that'd make me scream
[02:06:26] <wood_quinn> So I personally think it's fine to do, if the parent has a family background of it.
[02:06:51] <wood_quinn> Now if you wanted to go and start removing male nipples, I might think you're odd.
[02:07:07] <Skywise> what are they for anyway
[02:07:11] <wood_quinn> So I suppose it's a matter of how established the practice is in your perception of the world.
[02:07:21] <wood_quinn> Skywise: Calorie loss.
[02:07:29] <KaMii> well, if the did, then at least there would be a reason why guys can go topless and girls cant
[02:07:29] <Skywise> mine ain't workin
[02:07:50] <Skywise> its cause girls don't really wanna go topless
[02:07:53] <wood_quinn> Rub 'em twice an hour, and you loose 4 calories.
[02:08:04] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Eh women are different.
[02:08:05] <Skywise> 4, eh?
[02:08:09] <KaMii> Skywise: thats not true at all
[02:08:18] <hplc> nah go mainstream and pierce them :)
[02:08:26] <Skywise> i think it is, they pretend they wanna, but they don't wanna
[02:08:39] <KaMii> go visit sweden
[02:08:44] <Skywise> i know girls who don't wanna be seen in sweat suits
[02:08:44] <wood_quinn> Now this isn't a sexist statement understand, but women's bodies are solely designed to create children.

[02:09:00] <xocel> personally i think its a tad rude to do to a child. desensitizes everything without the extra protection.
[02:09:03] <wood_quinn> You can't do that if every part of your body isn't designed to be sexually appealy.
[02:09:29] <Skywise> i would like topless women all year around, but women won't let it happen
[02:09:30] <wood_quinn> xocel: You don't know what you don't know.
[02:09:44] <KaMii> no, the police wont let it happen

[02:16:02] <Skywise> sheesh
[02:16:51] <saivnoba> hi i did a fresh install of slackware 14. set up slackpkg mirror. but when i do update and upgrade-all it does not upgrade.
[02:17:03] <Skywise> why would it upgrade
[02:17:12] <KaMii> well they better start doing self brest exams or they will get cancer, but im sure they think thats wrong too

[02:18:23] <saivnoba> KaMii: No packages match the pattern for upgrade.
[02:18:39] <KaMii> saivnoba: did you run it as root?
[02:18:48] <saivnoba> yes
[02:18:51] <wood_quinn> saivnoba: Do you know you need some patch?
[02:19:08] <Skywise> all my gf's friends are single now and they all want a man who wants them to be the center of everything
[02:19:19] <KaMii> saivnoba: what was the exact command you typed?
[02:19:24] <wood_quinn> I'm cool with a girl wanting to be the center of everything.
[02:19:24] <hplc> without tab completion an * wildcard maybe helps? just a guess
[02:19:26] <KaMii> and did you select more than one mirror?

[02:19:47] <KaMii> lol wood_quinn
[02:19:50] <saivnoba> i first selected mirror. only one. then slackpkg update.
[02:19:58] <wood_quinn> I ask again, "What needs upgraded?"
[02:20:01] <KaMii> try a different mirror
[02:20:02] <saivnoba> there was nothing of interest in install-new so in typed upgrade-all

[02:20:08] <KaMii> maybe the one you tried is down
[02:20:21] <wood_quinn> Because "No packages match the pattern for upgrade" doesn't have anything to do with a mirror failure.
[02:20:21] <saivnoba> i tried different mirror, same result.
[02:20:30] <wood_quinn> At least not usually.
[02:20:40] <KaMii> i never even saw that error before
[02:21:01] <Skywise> are there updated packages?
[02:21:07] <saivnoba> wood_quinn: I'm just want to get my system up-to-date.
[02:21:08] <KaMii> wood_quinn: he probably wants the latest security updates
[02:21:19] <Skywise> oh yeah? like what
[02:21:26] <wood_quinn> And my question is, "Does anything need upgraded?"
[02:21:28] <saivnoba> i know there is update as firefox is now at 17.0.1 but on my fresh install it is 15.0.1
[02:21:31] <KaMii> which means, he will get firefox and seamonkey
[02:21:33] <KaMii> thats about it
[02:21:34] <wood_quinn> Ok.

[02:21:47] <KaMii> well, firefox sucks
[02:21:54] <Skywise> its been at least a week so theres gotta be a ff update
[02:22:03] <KaMii> and if you really need the update, just grab it off the ftp mirror and upgradepkg
[02:22:07] <wood_quinn> Skywise: Actually they do daily now.
[02:22:27] <wood_quinn> saivnoba: And you've done slackpkg update and it actually says ChangeLog.txt differs?
[02:22:28] <Skywise> i'd check, but i think you're right
[02:22:32] <hplc> isnt YUM easier still for binary upgrades?
[02:22:32] <wood_quinn> Skywise: Hehe.
[02:22:49] <KaMii> no idea how you managed to bork slackpkg
[02:23:16] <saivnoba> wood_quinn: no. it says there is no change do you wish to check others with (y/N). no difference if i try both y or N.
[02:23:34] <Skywise> its easy, simply do things no one would of expected anyone to do and then wait for it to stop working
[02:23:40] <KaMii> so that means you are already upto date
[02:23:44] <saivnoba> KaMii: i had network problem so had to Ctrl+C initially :-p
[02:23:59] <Skywise> yeah, i figure that
[02:24:30] <Skywise> thats the part they always leave out

[02:25:04] <KaMii> a network problem... is sooo vague
[02:25:19] <KaMii> reinstall slackware3
[02:25:40] <wood_quinn> saivnoba: Use slackware.mirrors.tds.net as your mirror, do "slackpkg update" and see what happens.
[02:25:42] <saivnoba> KaMii: I use prepaid internet. the credit ran out and slackpkg was waiting...
[02:25:42] <KaMii> next time, dont trip over the cat 5 cable during installation or upgrading
[02:25:55] <saivnoba> i had to stop it recharge and start over again.
[02:26:10] <KaMii> well, i would then suggest you dont use slackpkg then
[02:26:20] <wood_quinn> I would suggest you re-run it.
[02:26:26] <KaMii> but that should not have any affect on yoy
[02:26:26] <hplc> im by no means any pro, but if i wanted to check updates for slack i´d try to see if YUM would work for me
[02:26:41] <KaMii> as slackopkg first downloads then upgrades
[02:26:49] <KaMii> if it didnt get the package it wont do anything
[02:26:56] <wood_quinn> hplc: Why would someone install YUM on Slackware to get updates when Slackware provides tools intended for that purpose?
[02:27:07] <Skywise> yeah, use apt-get like you should
[02:27:13] <KaMii> lol
[02:27:14] <xocel> lol
[02:27:29] <KaMii> well the first part of his statement is ture
[02:27:30] <wood_quinn> Anyway, re-download everything and make sure it isn't interrupted.
[02:27:31] <KaMii> true even
[02:27:33] <KaMii> hes no expert
[02:27:41] <hplc> wood_quinn: just a thought on the perspective of easy and less prone to fail for beginners such as myself
[02:27:46] <wood_quinn> YUM?
[02:27:53] <KaMii> i would suggest reinstalling slackpkg first
[02:27:57] <KaMii> see if that fixes your issue
[02:27:59] <wood_quinn> What's difficult about "slackpkg update; slackpkg upgrade-all"
[02:28:16] <KaMii> how is slackpkg prone to failure?
[02:28:26] <Skywise> nothing until you  blow it up in the middle
[02:28:29] <KaMii> because it has no gui?
[02:28:32] <saivnoba> wood_quinn: tried your mirror. same issue.
[02:28:43] <hplc> no idea, i never even tried to update a slackware before
[02:28:43] <KaMii> saivnoba: reinstall slackpkg
[02:28:55] <Skywise> i say back up your user files and  reinstall
[02:28:55] <KaMii> hplc: then stop trying to help
[02:28:58] <hplc> my first install
[02:29:02] <wood_quinn> hplc: Oh. Well welcome to 2004, where slackpkg has been introduced to the world.
[02:29:09] <KaMii> lol
[02:29:53] <KaMii> saivnoba: are you talking to us on the same slackware machine that is having problems?
[02:29:58] <xocel> clear any temp files slackpkg created. You shouldnt need to reinstall.
[02:30:13] <KaMii> oh, he did an update
[02:30:17] <hplc> hmm well.......atleast i managed to stop the former warlike discussion :p :D
[02:30:20] <KaMii> saivnoba: run slackpkg new-config
[02:30:26] <KaMii> then change your mirror list again
[02:30:31] <Skywise> theres gotta be a word for when you fix something to destruction
[02:30:52] <KaMii> what warlike discussion?
[02:31:01] <saivnoba> KaMii: yes, i'm on same machine that has problem with slackpkg
[02:31:05] <saivnoba> i uninstalled installed slackpkg
[02:31:19] <KaMii> run slackpkg new-config
[02:31:32] <wood_quinn> Oh uninstalling slackpkg.
[02:31:39] <wood_quinn> Good. (What?)
[02:31:47] <hplc> nvm
[02:32:01] <KaMii> i missed a warlike discussion?
[02:32:04] Action: wood_quinn butts out because obviously this has become confusing.
[02:32:25] <Skywise> thats what made it worth paying attention to
[02:32:54] <Skywise> i think one more tangent and we end up back where we started
[02:32:56] <KaMii> im willing to bet, there is more to the story, he just hasnt told us yet
[02:33:11] <Skywise> yes, but the flames are out now
[02:33:52] <KaMii> like, his internet crapped out during net install and he only got half a system
[02:34:15] Action: hplc feels like an idiot, goes for a smoke and then examines this slack pkg system
[02:34:17] <KaMii> and he figured, he can fix it all with slackpkg
[02:34:30] <KaMii> its slackpkg

[02:34:48] <Skywise> yeah, just run it again and it will fix what was borked
[02:35:00] <KaMii> its magic, like apt-get
[02:35:41] <wood_quinn> apt-get isn't magic.
[02:35:41] <KaMii> apt-get fixmysystem  calculating dependencies......................... dependency found.... ubuntu...... downloading ubuntu...........
[02:35:45] <wood_quinn> aptitude is magic.
[02:35:55] <wood_quinn> 'cuz it's got a "GUI"
[02:35:58] <KaMii> lol

[02:36:50] <KaMii> ive never even seen aptitude before
[02:37:06] <Skywise> clicking is easier then Y
[02:37:20] <hplc> its a pure terminal based pkg system, no need for GUI
[02:37:42] <KaMii> lol, clicking is easier thatn y
[02:38:17] <wood_quinn> aptitude is an ncurses interface to apt-get
[02:38:20] <KaMii> unless you are that guy that came in earlier that had mouse issues
[02:38:29] <wood_quinn> I think even Ubuntu dropped it.
[02:38:33] <KaMii> hahahahaha
[02:38:39] <wood_quinn> That's gotta tell you somethign.
[02:38:44] <KaMii> if ubuntu dropped a gui, then you know it sucked
[02:38:54] <Skywise> yeah, cause they have no standards

[02:39:16] Action: KaMii is bringing unity to slackware
[02:39:17] <xocel> argh, apt-get broke my backtrack install(apparently i didnt need luks anymore :/), since then i have hated it with a vengeance. It probably works slightly better on ubuntu tho i would imagine
[02:39:22] <saivnoba> hi, its working now. uninstalled and installed.
[02:39:27] <KaMii> unity.SlackBuild
[02:39:32] <KaMii> you can find it on my website
[02:39:51] <KaMii> xocel: backtrack is meant to be a live distro
[02:39:54] <wood_quinn> Backtrack being based on Ubuntu hurt my soul.
[02:40:20] <KaMii> saivnoba: i figured it got borked up somehow, now, care to tell us exactly what you did?
[02:40:24] <xocel> KaMii, it supports hdd installs. and i was using it as a mainish OS at the time due to the work i was doing.
[02:40:39] Disorganized (~Disorgani@c-24-7-60-25.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) joined ##slackware.
[02:40:39] <Skywise> it comes with a decal you stick on your monitor over the ubuntu logo
[02:40:41] <xocel> but yeah, not the most ideal setup

[02:40:48] NyteOwl (~sysop@unaffiliated/nyteowl) left irc: Quit: œ¿»Î½ »±²­
[02:40:50] <KaMii> xocel: i thought the main purpose for backtrack was to be a live distro for penetration testing
[02:40:58] <KaMii> not for a full install
[02:41:02] <Skywise> penetration testing, thats so lame
[02:41:04] <KaMii> saivnoba: yes, before it broke
[02:41:12] <hplc> why run X on slack at all?`i went for it because of the stability it offers without X, sounds like a contradiction to me
[02:41:30] <KaMii> hplc: since when was x unstable?
[02:41:37] <wood_quinn> 1996.
[02:41:44] <Skywise> i got a 1 line check list for penetration testing: run /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall
[02:41:47] <wood_quinn> Until about November.
[02:41:50] <KaMii> x doesnt crash on my system
[02:41:52] <xocel> yeah but it only needs to be live for local tests. remote tests it may as well be installed, runs a lot faster etc.
[02:42:03] <wood_quinn> Of 1996.

[02:42:26] <wood_quinn> Skywise: I've set up several.
[02:42:33] <Skywise> i was thinking about trying it or maybe its too crazy
[02:42:41] <wood_quinn> Including one that's being used by the CIA.
[02:42:44] <wood_quinn> And NASA.
[02:42:44] <Skywise> i basically wanna setup a backup
[02:42:52] <wood_quinn> Also the IRS.
[02:42:54] <xocel> wood_quinn, faster than an optical drive or usb stick. which is all i have.
[02:43:02] <KaMii> a cyrus cluster?  hows that different than a beuwolf?
[02:43:03] <wood_quinn> All you information, space, and money are belong to me.
[02:43:14] <Skywise> shipped to the same address i bet as well
[02:43:26] <wood_quinn> Oh noes.
[02:43:35] <saivnoba> KaMii: fresh install, slackpkg update but it stopped btwn while downloading changelogs as my internet stopped working. Ctrl+C to stop slackpkg.
[02:43:36] <wood_quinn> You have foiled by ingenious plan.
[02:43:45] <wood_quinn> saivnoba: Yep.
[02:43:48] <wood_quinn> slackpkg update
[02:43:48] sencha (~brad@184-222-195-191.pools.spcsdns.net) joined ##slackware.
[02:44:15] <wood_quinn> If that doesn't work more breakage is going on and I recommend just doing a fresh install and trying try again.
[02:44:26] <Skywise> he needs slackpkg unbork
[02:44:29] <saivnoba> KaMii: recharged internet and tried update. it said it is up-to-date if i wanted to continue. i did press y. so it downloaded again all the changelogs.
[02:44:40] <hplc> KaMii: i i didnt, i went for ssh instead to make necessary changes, port 10 000 if i want to see it graphically respresented
[02:44:52] <saivnoba> install-new shows calligra localization packages but upgrade-all nothing.
[02:45:10] <wood_quinn> calligra?
[02:45:14] <KaMii> saivnoba: because upgrade-all only upgrades the packags you have installed
[02:45:19] hiptobecubic (~john@unaffiliated/hiptobecubic) left irc: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[02:45:23] <KaMii> calligra is kdes new office suite crap
[02:45:31] <shonudo> hello all
[02:45:36] <wood_quinn> Oh.
[02:45:43] <KaMii> and install-new checks for any packages you do not have
[02:45:44] <wood_quinn> KOffice not good enough.
[02:45:52] <KaMii> i guess they canned it
[02:45:57] <saivnoba> KaMii: no, no, i meant install-new was showing something but upgrade-all was not showing anything.
[02:45:59] <KaMii> or changed the name
[02:46:11] <KaMii> saivnoba: yes, i know, it should be that way
[02:46:12] <saivnoba> KaMii: i wanted updated packages for firefox, thunderbird
[02:46:14] <wood_quinn> CalliDE
[02:46:27] <KaMii> install-new will show you what is on the mirror that is not on your system
[02:46:30] <wood_quinn> saivnoba: Try slackpkg upgrade firefox.
[02:46:48] <KaMii> upgrade-all only upgrades what you have installed on your system and ignores anything new
[02:46:52] <KaMii> RTFM
[02:47:04] <wood_quinn> I said it wasn't a mirror problem, perhaps I should now clarify and say it could be an out-of-date mirror.
[02:47:05] <saivnoba> wood_quinn: i had tried it but was not working. now everything is ok after reinstall.
[02:47:05] <KaMii> lol i have been waiting all day to say that
[02:47:12] <wood_quinn> saivnoba: So
[02:47:18] <wood_quinn> Everything is fine now?
[02:47:40] Action: wood_quinn claims all credit.
[02:47:41] <KaMii> wood_quinn: i think his changelog file got corrupted
[02:47:49] <KaMii> and somehow slackpkg couldnt fix the issue
[02:47:54] <saivnoba> wood_quinn: yes. i was just answering KaMii as to what i was doing when slackpkg stopped working.
[02:48:13] <wood_quinn> I think he was using some geographically close mirror from <dinkycountry> and it hasn't been updated for two months.
[02:48:21] <wood_quinn> Love it when people do that.
[02:48:25] <saivnoba> apt-get and yum have 'clean' option. slackpkg doesn't?
[02:48:34] <wood_quinn> clean-system
[02:48:35] <KaMii> saivnoba: RTFM
[02:48:41] <wood_quinn> RTFM²
[02:48:46] <KaMii> means READ THE FUCKING MANUAL
[02:48:54] <KaMii> or just type slackpkg --help
[02:48:59] <saivnoba> wood_quinn: KaMii i had tried clean-system it said no packages found
[02:49:13] Action: wood_quinn dies a little on the inside and goes to pee.
[02:49:21] <wood_quinn> I must first post that I am going to pee on Twitter.
[02:49:26] <KaMii> because clean system only cleans out packages that ARE NOT PART OF THE OFFICIAL SLACKWARE SET
[02:49:29] <wood_quinn> To release the brain-deadedness.
[02:49:40] <wood_quinn> That has built up over the course of this.
[02:49:43] <KaMii> ok, im done talking to  him, saivnoba go read the manual
[02:50:45] <KaMii> slackpkg has got to have one of the easiest manuals in the entire linux community to read.

[02:53:45] <KaMii> we dont do apt-get

[02:53:53] <KaMii> i have no idea how apt-get works
[02:53:54] <wood_quinn> slackpkg isn't stupid when making it's database.
[02:54:12] <wood_quinn> It understands the total lack of value in maintaining old databases, and simply rewrites it.
[02:54:14] Skywise (~noneya@unaffiliated/skywise) left irc: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[02:54:34] <KaMii> all your package database exists in /var/log/packages/

[02:55:22] <KaMii> it forgets what it has installed
[02:55:33] <jrl> anyone interested in helping me test a slackware build script? It's for a tcp socket stress test program (sockstress).
[02:55:53] <Skywise> lol
[02:56:00] <jrl> It works cleanly on my systems, but would like to get a couple more folks to give thumbs up too
[02:56:55] <shonudo> no thanks, my tcp socket is on stress medication
[02:57:01] <jrl> :)
[02:57:13] <KaMii> just upload it to slackbuilds, they test them before releasing
[02:57:25] <jrl> KaMii: did that earlier today.
[02:57:41] <KaMii> then, its a little late for us to test
[02:58:03] <jrl> <nod> ... I'm also going to be putting it up on a website tomorrow

[03:02:20] <shonudo> lol
[03:02:22] <KaMii> hours and hours of discussion and reesearch?
[03:02:35] <wood_quinn> Obviously.
[03:02:37] <hplc> apropos slackpkg shows up nothing at all, uname -r says 3.2.25, slackpkg only comes with the pure slackware edition? no guaratee on clones?/spinnoffs?

[03:03:26] <KaMii> hplc: well, you can put slackpkg on a different mirror
[03:03:31] <wood_quinn> Well my point is, if man slackpkg doesn't work you have a problem.
[03:03:39] <wood_quinn> You shouldn't have to search for the man page.
[03:03:46] <KaMii> throw your x86 slackpkg to armedslack's mirror, and let it run
[03:03:52] <wood_quinn> And we don't do that GNU info shit ;)

[03:05:50] <KaMii> lol
[03:06:00] <hplc> without x?
[03:06:01] <KaMii> hplc: you do not have a full install
[03:06:08] <adaptr> lies. slackware 14.0 is 7.3 GB.
[03:06:08] <KaMii> without means not a full install
[03:06:17] <KaMii> what did you leave out?
[03:06:26] <KaMii> i bet he left out the f set
[03:06:32] <KaMii> all the manpages were there
[03:06:40] <hplc> just picked server components in a text based installer
[03:06:51] <KaMii> well, thats why, you didnt install manpages
[03:06:56] <hplc> did choose "full install"
[03:06:58] <KaMii> did you install all of a and ap
[03:07:01] <hplc> man install works
[03:07:20] <KaMii> you obviously do not have a full install
[03:07:22] <wood_quinn> adaptr: It looks like x86 14.0 is only 6.9.
[03:07:44] <KaMii> well yea, i did a full install, but i left out half of slackware!
[03:07:45] <adaptr> meh, who has 32bit hardware anymore
[03:07:57] <gnisho> <--
[03:07:58] <KaMii> what do you think full install means?
[03:08:01] <wood_quinn> Not sure why the changes to the installer where made to be honest. It increases enough per release there's no point.
[03:08:29] <hplc> slackbased SMS textinstaller claimed its full install (no X) was approx 2Gb
[03:08:38] <wood_quinn> Heck even x64 is still 7.0
[03:09:04] <wood_quinn> hplc: http://imgur.com/h6iNN
[03:09:08] <gnisho> granted, that 32-bit hardware is arm devices, but still.
[03:09:20] <wood_quinn> I still have a P4.
[03:09:29] <KaMii> hplc: when we say full install, we mean that you installed everything, what you are talking about is full install from the package sets you decided to include, you did a full of those package sets
[03:09:46] <wood_quinn> Also of note, when we say full install, we mean of *Slackware*
[03:09:47] <Skywise> put slackware on your watch to run ntp
[03:09:48] <KaMii> you do not have a full install of slackware
[03:10:04] <KaMii> i cant even believe we are needing to explain this
[03:10:13] <KaMii> i thought full was self explanitory
[03:10:13] <Skywise> its friday

[03:10:42] <wood_quinn> Official pure Slack.
[03:10:43] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[03:10:45] <KaMii> and you dont want it anyway
[03:10:57] <KaMii> what wonky server did he net install from?
[03:11:00] <wood_quinn> As opposed to the unofficial pure Slack, or the official impure Slack.
[03:11:14] <Skywise> yeah, that stuff is whack
[03:11:15] <KaMii> jacks pure slack
[03:11:33] <wood_quinn> These variants, though not well known in the world of computing, are a necessary part of the ecosystem.
[03:11:35] <KaMii> he did a slack'n'jack install
[03:11:37] <hplc> well since anything else based on slackware aint a guarentee
[03:11:59] <hplc> slackware as base doesnt mean shit in this context then
[03:12:01] <wood_quinn> Powering everything from food services to nuclear warheads, this "mutt" Slack is truly an incredible creature.
[03:12:02] <KaMii> and that has what berring on slackware?
[03:12:06] <xocel> hplc, what are you using exactly?
[03:12:13] <Skywise> theres no guarantee in slackware cause you did it
[03:12:19] <hplc> SMS superb mini server
[03:12:33] <KaMii> so since slackware forked distro 'a' has issues, that means that slackware itself is borked?
[03:12:35] <Skywise> hmm, doesn't seem all that good to me
[03:12:54] <wood_quinn> SMS superb mini server.
[03:13:01] <wood_quinn> With a name like that, no way it's shit.
[03:13:04] <Skywise> echo
[03:13:09] <wood_quinn> echo
[03:13:16] <hplc> is it, or aint it slackbased?

[03:13:58] <wood_quinn> Not that they aren't cool.
[03:13:59] <KaMii> why would we know about a supposedly forked distro?
[03:13:59] <Skywise> i wonder where you were going with that
[03:14:11] Action: adaptr shorts wood_quinn's stock
[03:14:19] <wood_quinn> Just we don't really care and it's important to note that you're using one when you're asking questions.
[03:14:42] <KaMii> anything with the name 'superb' in the title is probably shit

[03:17:01] <Skywise> its version 2, they're still moving up
[03:17:04] <adaptr> ...why would that be in any way an indication of veracity

[03:37:52] <wood_quinn> And they'll charge you a $35 fee fee.

[03:52:24] <hplc> hmm true

[03:52:46] <KaMii> the cd's are split
[03:52:48] <hplc> nope
[03:52:54] <wood_quinn> But as for "ganked" which I can only assume means "bore down," we could have been nicer sure.
[03:52:59] <hplc> 2 separate dvds
[03:53:07] <KaMii> oh, 14 split the dvd's?
[03:53:09] <wood_quinn> But it had nothing to do with superiority.
[03:53:16] <wood_quinn> Just people being jerks.
[03:53:25] <KaMii> he needed to rtfm

[04:18:34] <rfmonk> i used slackpkg to dl xfce and went to edit xinitrc there was an error im missing perl.so
[04:18:56] <rfmonk> before i go and reinstall was wondering if there is a painless way to do this
[04:19:12] <wood_quinn> You can just use slackpkg instll <whateverset>
[04:19:22] <wood_quinn> In this case "slackpkg install x"
[04:20:05] <rfmonk> is xwmconfig in package x then?

[04:20:36] <wood_quinn> That's a question being asked from someone that doesn't understand Slackware's package management, and I think you'll get farther if I don't answer it.
[04:21:08] <rfmonk> well most of the docs assume this is installed
[04:21:14] <wood_quinn> Apparently there's a Slackbook on disc one.
[04:21:32] <wood_quinn> If it's remotely up to date, and possibly even if it's not, it'll have the info you want.

[04:23:30] <wood_quinn> Yes you're missing a ton of stuff.
[04:23:43] <rfmonk> was trying to dldisk 1

[04:24:43] <wood_quinn> Yeah.
[04:24:49] <wood_quinn> You're gonna have to use the bandwidth.
[04:25:11] <wood_quinn> We had someone else in here recently that thought it was a good idea to download the first disc and network the rest too.

[04:26:37] <rfmonk> going to dualboot with gentoo on 2nd half, any gotchas that are not apparent?
[04:27:02] <shonudo> not really; it's not like you're dualbooting with windows
[04:27:05] <shonudo> you should be fine
[04:27:09] <rfmonk> ok
[04:27:45] <wood_quinn> The only gotcha is that Gentoo doesn't share its flame stickers.
[04:28:24] <KaMii> is there a way to make sure, if you lose your network connection that nfs wont halt all systems?
[04:28:46] <adaptr> look at the soft and hard fail options
[04:28:47] <Skywise> no, nfs pretty much has a hissy fit
[04:28:51] <KaMii> i have issues of nfs or rather rpc halting if I lose my network
[04:29:13] <KaMii> becuase if I need to reboot my router i have to take each system off nfs first
[04:29:19] <KaMii> of everything crashes
[04:29:25] <KaMii> and its a pita
[04:29:39] <adaptr> the default is softfail. set it to hardfail to error out immediately, then you can umount.
[04:29:43] <Skywise> maybe you can increase your time out, but that is a draw back to nfs
[04:29:53] <Skywise> and you prolly shouldn't be rebooting your router so often
[04:29:58] <adaptr> you want the opposite.

[05:16:00] doug713705 (~doug71370@220.156.175.94) joined ##slackware.
[05:16:02] <Skywise> because they like a simple, clean straight forward distro that doesn't try to do a lot for you
[05:16:23] <min|dvir|us> Is it comparable to Debian?
[05:16:33] <Skywise> just like it
[05:16:39] <jrl> a distro is just a simple way to install linux, and to maintain applications (package management)
[05:16:40] <Skywise> its got a kernel and packages and everything
[05:16:54] <min|dvir|us> That's a lot like every other OS.
[05:16:56] <Skywise> but slackware doesn't do dependency checking
[05:17:03] <Skywise> its exactly like every other os
[05:17:09] <min|dvir|us> OK, so the package manager isn't the best?
[05:17:11] <Skywise> as a matter of fact, thats all an os is

[05:17:17] <Skywise> it works fine
[05:17:29] <wood_quinn> Isn't the best heh.
[05:17:30] <Skywise> i'm not really sure what you would expect from a package manager
[05:17:34] <min|dvir|us> How does it retrieve dependencies? Does it?

[05:17:42] <Skywise> sure it doesn't make sandwiches, but who does
[05:17:45] <jrl> min: the package manager stays out of your way

[05:22:46] <Skywise> current is current development, its not guaranteed to be functional at any given time even tho it usually is

[05:23:11] <Skywise> installing -current can have side effects and you should of thought about that before installing it

[05:23:29] <min|dvir|us> Gotcha.
[05:23:54] <min|dvir|us> So packages must have special build scripts or whatever.

[06:50:47] <TommyC> Right, but how do your applications know to use that as the directory to use for icons?
[06:50:56] <shonudo> for apps with lame-assed icons, like qupzilla for example
[06:51:04] xocel (~xocel@101.98.159.174) left irc: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[06:51:23] <Skywise> i used to like the part about drawing icons
[06:51:23] <TommyC> Like if I have foo.jpg for an icon (just an example), how does the system know to use /opt/icons/foo.jpg instead of /usr/share/icons/foo.jpg?
[06:51:29] <shonudo> oh, if you want to do it with the app itself, just replace the default icon with the one you made (name it the same as whatever the app uses)
[06:51:49] <shonudo> for kde, you just use the menu editor for the desktop/panel icons
[06:52:23] <shonudo> and for the app itself, you can just go through and replace every png or jpeg with your own
[06:52:43] <TommyC> I tried that (and I'm not using KDE).
[06:53:02] <TommyC> I've googled for this, and a lot of posts seem to say to use gtk-update-icon-{cache,theme} but that doesn't appear to do what I need it to do.
[06:53:31] <shonudo> it can get a bit involved; and you can screw things up
[06:53:46] <TommyC> meh, icons getting screwed up aren't going to hurt me
[06:53:48] <Skywise> you should back somethin gup
[06:54:05] <shonudo> you really should do a backup
[06:54:15] <TommyC> maybe
[06:54:17] <shonudo> you'd be surprised at how annoying it can be to mess icons up
[06:54:36] <shonudo> if icons meant nothing to you, you wouldn't be asking :)
[06:55:10] <TommyC> heh, I guess so
[06:55:59] <TommyC> I've googled "custom icons Linux" and probably every synonym of custom...
[06:57:44] <Skywise> what about manage
[06:58:33] <TommyC> hmm, haven't tried that one yet

[14:53:48] <AtomPhil> hi all, quick question on slackware installation if I may
[14:54:01] <AtomPhil> trying to install slackware ARM on my raspberry pi
[14:54:16] <AtomPhil> is it enough to point the installer at an NFS mount of the source tree on the local network?
[14:54:35] <Sandman1> I do not know about ARM, but don't you have to compile a kernel for specifically the raspberry pi
[14:54:39] <AtomPhil> I've run across conflicting documentation suggesting I need to create an image from it first, which I don't understand
[14:55:20] <AtomPhil> I can boot to setup using an image downloaded from here: http://www.daves-collective.co.uk/raspi/
[14:55:21] <Demon_Fox> and there goes the caffeine rush
[14:55:25] <Demon_Fox> night nigh
[14:55:30] <Demon_Fox> or day day I suppose

[14:57:04] <Sandman1> Seems they did all the hard work for you
[14:57:39] <AtomPhil> yes, it's just this source step I'm finding difficult to understand - and for that the site there points me at the main slackware documentation
[14:58:32] <Sandman1> Link me to that specific part
[14:58:58] <AtomPhil> http://www.daves-collective.co.uk/raspi/installing.shtml
[14:59:09] <AtomPhil> 'Run 'setup' as usual. Your SOURCE can be on the network or on a USB device. '
[15:00:08] <AtomPhil> so I guess my question is, what is a SOURCE - is it just an NFS directory of the source tree? or is there some intermediate step?

[15:04:59] <pink_mist> "SOURCE" is a step in the slackware setup program.
[15:05:29] <AtomPhil> yes, but that step requires that you mount a slackware source
[15:05:56] <AtomPhil> what is the slackware source?
[15:06:06] <pink_mist> yes, it asks where you've mounted it ... you can point it to any mounted resource you have.
[15:06:09] <pink_mist> uhm
[15:06:20] <AtomPhil> is it just the source tree? I have a copy of that available over NFS
[15:06:28] <pink_mist> the slackware install media with the /slackware or /slackware64 directory on it
[15:06:41] <pink_mist> it's not actually the source code
[15:06:51] <pink_mist> it's the source it should use to install the binary packages from.
[15:07:01] <Sandman1> the cd
[15:07:14] <pink_mist> Sandman1: a raspberry pi doesn't have a cd..
[15:07:21] <AtomPhil> yeah, the ARM branch doesn't provide ISOs
[15:07:29] <Sandman1> pink_mist, I know
[15:07:31] <Sandman1> o
[15:07:37] <pink_mist> Sandman1: then why did you say that?
[15:07:39] <Sandman1> i tried to get him to understand
[15:07:48] <Sandman1> source = cd, nfs, folder, installation files, etc
[15:07:52] <pink_mist> AtomPhil: so then where your crosscompiled binaries are...
[15:08:06] <pink_mist> or rather, the packages of them
[15:08:32] <AtomPhil> ah-hah

[19:19:47] <Skaperen> hint: the OS was not Windows
[19:19:53] <Skywise> how do you setup bios
[19:20:08] <Skaperen> didn't need to
[19:20:09] <pi31415> Skywise, some motherboards can show BIOS on the serial console
[19:20:17] <Skaperen> and there is that
[19:20:24] <pi31415> Tyan
[19:20:39] <Skaperen> SuperMicro can do that, too
[19:20:47] <Skywise> i think you usually need to update bios, if for nothing else to change the sata mode from ide to ahci or raid
[19:21:01] <Skaperen> ASUS and Intel as well (though Intel is still apparently handling PS/2 wrong)
[19:21:53] <Skaperen> Intel: power up and boot with PS/2 unconnected ... connect PS/2 after it's up ... 50/50 that mouse and keyboard are transposed
[19:21:55] <Skywise> and sata mode makes a huge difference, especially with sataIII peripherals

[19:33:43] <Skaperen> and my format would even support VFR/VSR
[19:34:07] <Skywise> is the frame rate a ntsc/pal thing?
[19:34:48] <Skaperen> I would do frame rate without specifying ntsc/pal ... it would just be a frame timing item
[19:34:54] bdiego (~bdiego@190.244.30.68) left irc: Ping timeout: 255 seconds
[19:35:48] <Skywise> i'm just wondering what you'd do about partial frames in the conversion
[19:35:51] <Skaperen> in my design each frame would have a time code specified in units of the stream clock rate
[19:36:16] <Skaperen> by partial frame to you mean a subset update?
[19:36:20] <Skywise> would you drop the frame or double it
[19:36:38] bdiego (~bdiego@190.244.30.68) joined ##slackware.
[19:36:51] <Urchlay> ntsc and pal are (from the POV of a video file format) just two specific framerate/resolution combos. You'd probably just want to support arbitrary res and framerate
[19:36:52] <Skaperen> my format would not specify an action by the display
[19:37:24] <Skaperen> my format would have arb res/geom, and arb framerate ... but changeable in mid stream
[19:37:45] <Skaperen> arb color depth, monochrome, audio alignment
[19:37:47] <Urchlay> Skywise: 3rd option, if your CPU is fast enough, interpolate 2 existing frames to generate the missing frame. Not sure that approach ever gives good results though
[19:38:19] <Skywise> there really isn't a good solution, you either get a skip or stutter
[19:38:29] <Skaperen> if I wrote a display program, I'd start with just leaving the previous frame as is for the missing frame
[19:38:56] <Skaperen> then more work to have it figure out a replacement frame ... depending on how much time is available
[19:38:57] |Slacker| (~cris@186.214.44.223) joined ##slackware.
[19:38:58] <Urchlay> yeah, I remember being surprised, divx doesn't support black & white directly. B/W content ends up getting stored as R/G/B, which wastes bytes
[19:39:28] <Skywise> black and white is really grey scale tho
[19:39:31] <Skaperen> Urchlay: that's because someone didn't think

[19:44:21] <Skaperen> they should include the fee in the purchase price
[19:44:26] <pi31415> could be a good deal if you're willing to view a fuzzy crt and use old software
[19:44:51] <Skaperen> 2 of my CRTs are high res computer monitors

[19:44:59] <Urchlay> Skaperen: maybe they do, these days. Most of the CRTs I've wanted to get rid of, were old, dating back to before the regulations existed
[19:45:01] <Skaperen> and even those are free for the taking

[19:46:46] <Skywise> it was top of the line in its day
[19:46:50] <Guest31613> it died
[19:47:43] <Skywise> i got empty atx chassis i'll never use
[19:47:44] <Urchlay> those old sun monitors are nice. And durable. I tried to break the screen on one with a sledgehammer once and it didn't even scratch (made a gunshot-like sound that echoed through the neighborhood though)
[19:48:04] <Skywise> i even got a new chassis that was damaged in shipment, i got a free replacement for
[19:48:35] <Skaperen> Urchlay: what's the YT code for that video?
[19:48:40] <Skywise> the corners by the battery is bent up, but its prolly still useable

[20:14:03] <ananke> bobbydrake: your operating system will use all those cores. however, not every software is parallelized, which means those programs will use only one core at the time
[20:14:18] <ananke> good news is that you can run more than one thing at the same time
[20:14:53] <bobbydrake> thanks ananke, so changing MAKEOPTS to say -j9 wouldn't make sense
[20:15:49] <ananke> bobbydrake: it makes sense if you have 8 cores and want to use all of them for compilation. -j only applies to the compile process, it has nothing to do with how the result will be executed

[20:18:46] <NyteOwl> Having someone else make your PGP keys kinda defeats the purpsoe of having a PRIVATE key don't you think?
[20:18:46] <pprkut> speed up by parallelization depends on more than just number of cores
[20:18:51] <Nh3xus> so basically a Pentium IV with hyperthreading turned on , I can do make -j2 ?
[20:19:09] <ananke> Nh3xus: in my benchmarks, HT for compilation would usually result in about 25-30% speedup, but eventually you run into issues like I/O speed

[20:55:51] <pim_> /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.14' not found (required by /usr/lib/libsigc-2.0.so.0)
[20:56:05] <pim_> does anybody know what this is exactly supposed to mean?
[20:56:08] <alex20032> I heard that slackware is similaire to BSD
[20:56:15] <ananke> alex20032: it's not.
[20:56:22] <pim_> latest version of glibc is 2.17
[20:56:45] <ananke> alex20032: other than a fairly primitive installer, and a set of init scripts that vaguely resemble some of the bsd init scripts
[20:56:50] <alex20032> Well, on Slackware, we need to manually manage dependancy...
[20:57:20] <alex20032> what does it mean? Does it mean if i want to install a package that require 50 librairie, i need to manually install those 50 librairie?
[20:57:21] <ananke> alex20032: with many bsds dependencies are managed automatically
[20:57:38] <ananke> alex20032: yes.
[20:58:14] <alex20032> Well, then it surely take lot of time to insall something, many time, when i use apt-get, it want to install like 100 dependency
[20:59:00] <ananke> alex20032: yep. that's why the recommended slackware installation includes a ton of stuff
[20:59:39] <alex20032> But except managing dependency manually, does installing software is simple?
[20:59:51] <alex20032> Like something equivalent to apt-get?
[21:00:03] <ananke> alex20032: there is, but it's fairly primitive. it's called 'slackpkg'
[21:00:20] <pim_> there is slapt-get
[21:00:39] <ananke> slapt-get is a third party tool, and it doesn't solve the issue of dependencies
[21:01:09] <pim_> no, but it is like apt-get in the sense that it will search for packages and allow you to install them easily
[21:01:23] <poprocks> oh, I thought slapt-get did manage deps. Maybe I'm thinking of swaret
[21:01:25] <pim_> without downloading packages or sources manually

[21:02:09] <alex20032> well, does slackpkg is the official way to do thing?
[21:02:20] <poprocks> Ah, I thought it did some kind of ::shudder:: ldd magic or something like that, ala RPM.

[21:05:25] <alex20032> sorry, not english native
[21:05:51] <ananke> alex20032: and there are two branches of slackware: the stable branch, which doesn't change, and slackware-current. -current is the development/rolling release
[21:06:22] <alex20032> Does people are encouraged to use -current?

[21:07:07] <ananke> alex20032: most people should stick to the stable releases, at least when they start off with slackware
[21:07:27] <alex20032> Or is current considered experimental and use at your own risk, since verry very risky?
[21:07:50] <ananke> poprocks: indeed, you're right: The first line says it all: RPM is creating the binary package for cdplayer version 1.0, release 1. Next, RPM determines what packages are required by cdplayer-1.0-1. Part of this process entails running ldd on each executable program in the package. In this example, the package requires the libraries libc.so.5, and libncurses.so.2.0. Other dependency information can be included in the spec file, but for our example w
[21:08:19] <poprocks> ananke: I'm not saying I necessarily *like* that functionality ;-)
[21:08:21] <ananke> alex20032: -current is 'work-in-progress', and yes, you can use it on your own risk
[21:08:49] <ananke> alex20032: generally it's fairly stable, mostly because slackware doesn't have that many packages
[21:09:12] <poprocks> ananke: but I was working on an RPM-based distro that never got off the ground a few years ago and as a result I was using RPM heavily, so learning how it did its ldd magic (and when to tell it not to) was crucial
[21:09:41] <poprocks> but anyway, I prefer the Slackware Way(tm) :-)
[21:10:02] <ananke> poprocks: most of my package building is done via suse studio. and i do prefer rpm way :)
[21:11:34] <poprocks> actually it's not so much RPM that I dislike, it's the way 99% of RPM-based distro package their software:  libfoo, libfoo-static, libfoo-devel, libfoo-extra, etc. etc.  So much unnecessary modularity.

[21:18:33] <Urchlay> that's definitely one of his
[21:18:36] <ananke> Urchlay: ahh
[21:18:49] <ananke> pim_: it's possible you got libsigc++ package for a newer release of slackware
[21:18:51] <poprocks> sounds like you just installed some packs from alienbob's repo that are too new for 13.0.
[21:18:52] <pim_> so, I should just recompile libsigc?
[21:19:09] <ananke> pim_: you could check if he has packages for your release
[21:19:13] <Urchlay> pim_: ok, go back to the alienbob repo, find his package for the version of slackware you actually have installed (cat /etc/slackware-version if you don't remember)

[21:20:24] <ananke> poprocks: alex20032 was asking about dependency tracking and how it works on slackware
[21:20:26] <Urchlay> not exactly stupid. If you're new, it's more like ignorant or uneducated
[21:20:49] <Urchlay> ignorant people can learn, and then they're not ignorant
[21:20:53] <Urchlay> stupid is forever :)

[21:42:13] <alex20032> glib is gnome related, except if im wrong

[21:44:06] <Urchlay> hm. Wonder if dragonflybsd uses dcron for its cron (both are by the same guy)
[21:45:06] <alex20032> well, i read that installpkg install from source, since it use tarball... does those tarball contain source or a binary? (I like from source)
[21:45:19] <Urchlay> installpkg is for installing binary packages
[21:45:31] <alex20032> well, i wrongly formulated it...
[21:45:42] <Guest31613> binary tarballs
[21:46:05] <Urchlay> the binary packages are tarballs with a particular layout (install/ directory with slack-desc and possibly doinst.sh)
[21:46:07] <alex20032> the correctly formulated one:I heard installpkg install from tarball, does it install from source
[21:46:11] <Urchlay> nope
[21:46:16] <alex20032> but already awnsered
[21:46:34] <Urchlay> you use (or write) a SlackBuild script that builds the binary package from source

[21:48:15] <alex20032> SlackBuild?
[21:48:36] <Urchlay> yeah. Have a look here: ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-14.0/source/

[21:49:37] <Urchlay> each of those subdirs is for a package series, and each dir has one subdir per package in that series. Inside those subdirs are .SlackBuild scripts...
[21:50:04] <Urchlay> if you wanted to rebuild an official package from source, you'd use that (plus possibly your own modifications, if you were building a modified version)
[21:51:42] <alex20032> when i install something from source, can i remove it after with installpkg?
[21:52:13] <Urchlay> well, you remove stuff with removepkg, not installpkg...
[21:52:27] <Urchlay> but the answer is, if you didn't install it with installpkg, you can't remove it with removepkg
[21:52:38] <alex20032> so how should i uninstall from source?
[21:55:52] <Guest31613> go into the source directory, run make uninstall
[21:57:21] <Guest31613> you can use pkgtool for a more friendly package management interface
[21:57:30] <Urchlay> ...if the developer happened to include an uninstall target, that is
[21:57:38] <Urchlay> (it's not guaranteed)
[21:57:59] <alex20032> pkgtool was not a wrapper around installpkg?
[21:57:59] <Urchlay> "how should I uninstall from source?" is the original question that led to the invention of package managers
[21:58:05] <Urchlay> yes, it is
[21:58:29] <alex20032> if removepkg and installpkg cant work with source, then why pkgtool can?
[21:58:32] <Urchlay> it can't
[21:59:35] <Guest31613> there are not tools that aid you to careless install from source in slackware
[22:00:30] <shonudo> Urchlay, that has to be one of the best and to the point explanations of the function of a packagemanager
[22:00:32] <Urchlay> well, slacktrack and/or checkinstall. Those try to track what "make install" does and make a package from that. Which doesn't always work, or doesn't always give you a well-laid-out package

[22:04:13] <Guest31613> well theres www.slackbuilds.org
[22:04:22] <twelveheaded> alex20032, packages built with slackbuilds scripts become tgz which are legitimate packages managed by pkgtool.
[22:04:28] <alisonken1home> alex20032: actually, sbopkg can build sources once you create a .SlackBuild for it - and it will use pkgtools to install/remove them as well

[23:11:25] <Guest31613> the program died with -HUP signal
[23:11:55] <KaMii> you thought droid would look like slack?
[23:11:59] <ananke> Guest31613: lousy software
[23:12:03] <Schism-> that probably means that it doesn't support SIGHUP ;-)
[23:12:12] <Schism-> also p2p stuff comes back pretty quick
[23:12:30] <ananke> Guest31613: that's why 'reading the manual' was suggested :)
[23:12:31] <Schism-> so just a simple kill / restart would probably work

[23:14:11] <alex20032> Does python come pre installed with slackware?

[23:38:04] <Urchlay> ananke: you sure none of slackware's binaries are dyn linked to libpython.so? that would mean they'd need rebuilding if he changed python ver
[23:38:35] <ananke> Urchlay: he asked for 'system utilities'. i'm not aware of any.
[23:38:43] <Urchlay> alex20032: if you're looking for python 3, you can install it from slackbuilds.org, it doesn't conflict with the system python (which is 2.7 in slack 14)
[23:39:59] <alex20032> ananke: can you explain your awnser: alex20032: yes, www.slackware.com, and no

[23:42:17] <alex20032> ?
[23:42:27] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Yes.
[23:42:42] <Urchlay> sorry, you reminded me of Monty Python for a second. Ignore my attempt at humour if it's not funny

[23:46:00] egasco_ (~egasco@190.18.48.205) joined ##slackware.
[23:46:07] <Urchlay> alex20032: maybe if you tell us what you're actually trying to do? (you surely have a reason for asking about the python version?)
[23:46:19] <alex20032> was just curius
[23:46:21] <alex20032> curious
[23:46:26] <Urchlay> fair enough
[23:46:47] <alex20032> curious about which Distro adopted 3.x as their default, which one dont use python at all in their base installation
[23:46:53] dTd (~NoWay@d-206-53-83-77.cpe.metrocast.net) joined ##slackware.
[23:47:35] <Urchlay> slackware itself ships with 2.7. You can install 3.x side-by-side with it (and your python 3 scripts will need to begin with '#!/usr/bin/python3' or '#!/usr/bin/env python3')
[23:48:25] <Urchlay> eh, can install 3.x from slackbuilds.org, I mean (not from official slackware)
[23:49:17] <Urchlay> as far as the "base installataion" question... slackware doesn't require python at all, for booting or package management
[23:49:59] <Urchlay> (which I think is exactly what ananke meant, when he answered you above)
[23:50:01] egasco_ (~egasco@190.18.48.205) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[23:50:29] <wood_quinn> "find / -exec grep "#!/bin/python" {} \;"
[23:50:30] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[23:50:38] <alex20032> so if it dont require python at all, i can completely remove it and replace it by 3.x?
[23:50:45] <wood_quinn> If you really want to know what's using it.
[23:52:38] <alex20032> anyway, still curius to know these are awnser to which question: " yes, www.slackware.com, and no "
[23:53:07] <TheM4ch1n3> "find / -type f -exec grep "#!/bin/python" {} \;"
[23:53:47] <xocel> alex20032, i believe hes was answering your question just prior to that. yes it cames install, version can be found at slackware.com and no nothing crucial depends on it
[23:53:50] <wood_quinn> alex20032: He was just answering your question in the snarkiest, most unhelpful way possible.
[23:54:43] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: some stuff is written in C (or whatever) and links with libpython.so, also. Although I don't think anything required for slackware to boot is linked that way
[23:55:13] <wood_quinn> Python comes with Slackware, you can go to a package mirror to see which versions of Python come with which versions of Slack.
[23:55:15] <Urchlay> if you were to remove or upgrade the system python, those binaries wouldn't run (unable to load shared library)
[23:55:50] <Urchlay> but I dunno for sure there are any such binaries in slackware itself (I've had to rebuild SBo stuff for that reason, when upgrading slackware from 13.37 to 14)
[23:56:10] <wood_quinn> As for whether or not the system needs it, I think it's consensus that even if it does, you can still repair your system if you remove it.
[23:56:16] <wood_quinn> But it probably doesn't.

[23:58:28] <doug713705> alex20032: create your own one !
[23:58:42] <xocel> you'd be safer to run them side by side. Unless you want to re compile anything that breaks. e.g gimp perhapse (not sure if the slack package has python support enabled or not)\
