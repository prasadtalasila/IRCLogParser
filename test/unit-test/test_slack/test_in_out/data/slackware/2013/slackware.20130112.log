[02:03:05] <wood_quinn> Looks like if I submit a valid and timely claim, Facebook might give me $10 from a recent lawsuit.
[02:03:47] <wood_quinn> I guess that's how you make yourself legally immune; make sure the payoff your users get when you do something wrong is dinky.
[02:03:58] <Soul_keeper> Do they ban people for OT discussion here ?
[02:04:12] <wood_quinn> Then you don't have to pay the 99% that don't feel paperwork is worth $10.
[02:04:27] <pink_mist> Soul_keeper: why not read the rules?
[02:04:39] <TommyC> psst, there's a slackware-offtopic channel.
[02:04:44] <Soul_keeper> cause i'm banned from the OT channel because some woman's petsitter didn't get the keys to her house or something ...
[02:04:44] <wood_quinn> Soul_keeper: Not usually. It depends on how offtopic and whether or not it's getting in the way of on topic conversation.
[02:05:04] <wood_quinn> Banned from -offtopic?
[02:05:07] <Soul_keeper> yes
[02:05:08] <wood_quinn> What on earth did you do?

[04:02:00] <thumbs> aww.
[04:02:44] <Soul_keeper> is there a way to check if someone has me on their ignore list ?
[04:02:52] <thumbs> Soul_keeper: no.
[04:03:08] <thumbs> Soul_keeper: they could be using a mental ignore, for all you know.
[04:03:58] <Soul_keeper> could just be xchat I guess, some nicks have the hostmask others don't in query
[04:05:07] <thumbs> Soul_keeper: say what?
[04:05:31] <Soul_keeper> like where the topic is shown for a channel tab
[04:05:56] <Soul_keeper> it puts the hostmask for some users there and others it leaves blank
[04:06:43] <wood_quinn> That wouldn't have anything to do with ignore lists.
[04:06:47] <Soul_keeper> seems the ones that have me on ignore are left blank
[04:07:00] <thumbs> Soul_keeper: probably unrelated
[04:07:09] <Soul_keeper> ok
[04:07:43] <thumbs> Soul_keeper: there is no way your client could be aware of who is ignoring you. It's not possible.
[04:07:59] <wood_quinn> And /ignore doesn't block /whois
[04:08:08] <wood_quinn> Or /names
[04:08:13] <Soul_keeper> they used to say "unable to send message" when I was being ignored, maybe that was a network thing
[04:08:26] <thumbs> Soul_keeper: nope.
[04:08:31] <wood_quinn> That's a usermode.
[04:08:54] <thumbs> if you send a message to a user with /mode user +g or +R, you may get that
[04:08:56] <wood_quinn> It's "call screening" for IRC, if someone's not in a channel with you they can't PM you.
[04:08:59] <thumbs> probably +R
[04:09:16] <wood_quinn> I think you can also use whiteists for PMs.
[04:09:29] <Soul_keeper> ahh
[04:09:45] <thumbs> wood_quinn: yes, with +g
[04:09:45] <wood_quinn> So you get banned from -offtopic and find yourself /ignored a lot
[04:09:53] <wood_quinn> Good to know.
[04:09:59] <wood_quinn> thumbs: Ok.
[04:10:10] <Soul_keeper> I don't think so, just wondering
[04:10:22] <Soul_keeper> not in the channel would explain it
[04:11:23] <j4son> nothing spells defeat more than +g'ing someone
[04:12:02] <j4son> omg, logic with a side of common sense... better hurry up with /ignore
[04:12:48] <wood_quinn> Considering you shouldn't PM someone without asking them for permission unless you know ahead of time they don't mind, /ignore should be sufficient.
[04:12:51] <Soul_keeper> was trying to setup a video game with a someone, apparently sleeping
[04:13:04] <wood_quinn> Pretty sad more extreme methods are needed.
[04:13:14] <j4son> wtf @ asking prior to privmsg

[04:14:42] <j4son> your 3 year old history on IRC?
[04:14:44] <thumbs> since the 1990
[04:14:47] <wood_quinn> Since about fifteen minutes after the first IRC network was implemented.
[04:14:54] <Soul_keeper> arguably common, depends who you ask
[04:14:56] <thumbs> j4son: how old is my account? :)
[04:15:19] <j4son> dunno, don't care
[04:15:27] Action: wood_quinn always thinks it's funny when folks rag on established convention.
[04:15:38] <j4son> history on a IRC network that postdates 90% of IRC means shit t me
[04:15:40] <wood_quinn> "Oh, top posting isn't annoying"
[04:15:42] <j4son> so dunno what your angle is
[04:15:53] <wood_quinn> "Oh PMs aren't annoying"
[04:16:04] <j4son> they aren'y

[04:16:30] <wood_quinn> "Oh, CCing instead of BCCing when the other recipients have no need to know my email address isn't annoying"

[04:28:13] <j4son> piss poor cross platform support
[04:29:08] <FriedBob> Puppet 3.x has pretty decent support for Windows and OSX now, as well as BSDs, and *nix support has been strong from the start
[04:29:22] <FriedBob> At least for systems that use .debs or .rpms
[04:29:39] <wood_quinn> Which, with alien, is quite a few.

[05:00:07] <nofra> Advance our technology by about 500 years
[05:00:16] <nofra> And let inflation do the rest!
[05:00:38] <Skywise> i think light sabers are about 500 gabillion years ahead

[05:01:20] <Skywise> its where the light stops thats the tricky part

[05:01:50] <FriedBob> nofra: Yeah, but Cracker Jacks hasn't closed, so we just need to keepeating them till we find them
[05:02:10] <nofra> Light sabers are dumb....  I'd make one and make it 50ft long so I could kill the guy before he even got close!
[05:02:20] <Skywise> but i've wondered why they just don't strangle each other from a distance
[05:02:39] <nofra> Lotsa holes in Star Wars
[05:02:50] <FriedBob> Perhaps that only works on people with weak minds?

[05:04:58] <Skywise> but i really haven't watched anything since the 2nd one, after that i like enough already
[05:05:01] <nofra> Lucas is a big ol ass
[05:05:08] <FriedBob> nofra: Come on now. Lucas said it was about "continuing on the legacy" and passing it on to more capable hands.
[05:05:11] <Skywise> yeah,
[05:05:16] <wood_quinn> The third one was good enough IMO.
[05:05:18] <wood_quinn> Let it rest.
[05:05:20] <Skywise> the legacy, more like the franchise
[05:05:39] <wood_quinn> But no, gotta milk that puppy till it's got three inch teats.
[05:05:42] <Skywise> when they started doing prequels i wanted to take action
[05:05:46] <nofra> I'm hoping Disney will save it from Lucas and his "F U fans, I'm expanding Jar Jar's role to spite you..."
[05:06:14] <nofra> Jar Jar was Lucas' device to sell more crap to kids
[05:06:26] <Skywise> no, disney will make it so sickly sweet with cartoon darkness that even sw fans will choke on it
[05:06:30] <FriedBob> Jar Jar was from the American Dad alien.
[05:06:35] <nofra> Jar Jar agin and agin was Lucas' FU to the fans who complained
[05:06:50] <wood_quinn> I doubt Lucas had much to do with it.
[05:07:05] <wood_quinn> I'm sure he was delegating, and his delegates made choices.
[05:07:09] <nofra> I have faith that Disney is uber greedy and will try and do better without the Lucas ego
[05:07:24] <Skywise> where do you suppose he went while they were talking that one over
[05:07:29] <wood_quinn> I imagine he chose his battles.
[05:07:41] <wood_quinn> Just like any businessman or politician.
[05:07:46] <nofra> They spent alot of money on it...  It would be crazy to kill it because 15-50 nerds have WAY MORE MONEY than 1-14 kids
[05:07:50] <wood_quinn> You can't win 'em all, so you might as well let some go.
[05:08:20] <wood_quinn> nofra: 15-50 nerds have way less money than the parents of 1-14 kids.
[05:08:23] <nofra> wood_quinn: I'm sure Lucas was happy to unload it
[05:08:25] <Skywise> theres gonna be a daily animated show of things across the star wars empire done in simcity
[05:08:50] <nofra> wood_quinn: 15-50 nerds have less money but will spend a higher percentage
[05:08:57] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[05:09:08] <Skywise> disney is quite apt at fleecing both the parent and child
[05:09:13] <wood_quinn> Have you ever been a 1-14 kid and begged your parents for a toy?
[05:09:21] <nofra> The 30yr old nerd who collects SW crap will spend far more than the parent who buys thier kide 4 dolls
[05:09:42] <wood_quinn> You mean the parent of the 30 year old nerd.
[05:09:42] <Skywise> i'm sure there gonna gonna be a sw pavillion at the theme parks
[05:10:13] <nofra> I think the complaining that Lucas got from the fan for I-III combined with the big cash payout made it easy for him to sell
[05:10:21] <nofra> At the end of the day, he
[05:10:22] <wood_quinn> That's not a fair comparison, man. The 30 year old has a whole basement to store his toys in. The kid only has his room!
[05:10:27] <nofra> he's all about the $$$
[05:10:29] <Skywise> they're gonna sell hats, suntan lotion to the adults and souvenirs to the kids

[05:18:42] <wood_quinn> Was never a fan of that character.

[05:20:23] <nofra> Well, you did notice that they learned their lesson with NG and made the next 3 series full of fighting and less hugging
[05:20:41] <Skywise> do peace ships explode when you blow them up?

[06:28:36] <wood_quinn> He should have brought a USB hard drive and used that to boot Linux.

[06:35:05] <ananke> Jdogzz: windows 7 these days is a fairly stable platform
[06:35:59] <Jdogzz> Depends on what your definition and comparative object of stable are:)
[06:36:08] uNmowed (~Moka@94.245.168.150) joined ##slackware.
[06:36:19] <ananke> Jdogzz: based on your sample of 1, i don't think there is any room to talk about definitions
[06:36:44] <aceofspades19> when windows 7 gets bluescreens its usually a hardware or 3rd party driver problem
[06:36:57] <Jdogzz> That wasn't just my laptop, that was also my Dad's computer, my old desktop, and the dozens of computers at my high school computer labs.
[06:37:13] <ananke> Jdogzz: 'was'. how long ago, and what operating systems?
[06:37:22] <aceofspades19> inb4 windows 98
[06:37:44] <Jdogzz> About a year or two ago, and all Windows 7. Windows XP wasn't too bad with BSoD.
[06:39:03] <ananke> Jdogzz: our helpdesk manages hundreds of windows 7 systems. BSoD is something they see less than once a month, on a single system.

[06:40:00] <ananke> then again, i have little faith in a high school lab IT management
[06:40:02] <Jdogzz> Again, totally surprised by that:) Maybe we should switch computers...
[06:40:07] <aceofspades19> in my experience doing tech support I found most bluescreens were driver or hardware related

[06:40:15] <ananke> aceofspades19: yep
[06:40:20] <aceofspades19> very rarely was it the actual operating system crashing
[06:40:23] <byteframe> most bluescreens are blue related, derp.
[06:41:24] <wood_quinn> Is a Windows bluescreen a symptom of the same things as a kernel panic?
[06:41:37] <aceofspades19> and no matter how good microsoft is at coding, they can't fix third party drivers or broken hardware
[06:41:42] <Jdogzz> The IT guy at my high school was pretty good with his job, at least the teachers didn't have BSoDs on their computers (except my Dad's school computer). They spent most of their time asking me to help them get PPs working or bypassing the school's firewall to get on youtube.
[06:42:35] <ananke> wood_quinn: BSoD is the windows equivalent of a kernel panic
[06:42:51] <wood_quinn> Alright.
[06:43:14] <shonudo> well, sort of, except you're already booted and it's a massive data dump
[06:43:36] <aceofspades19> shonudo: not always, windows can bluescreen on boot
[06:43:38] <shonudo> not quite sure kernel panic and bsod actually compare
[06:43:39] <ananke> shonudo: uhmm, you do realize that a kernel panic can take place at any time, not just bootup
[06:43:55] <shonudo> ananke, yeah
[06:44:14] <ananke> and like aceofspades19 said, BSoD can also take place during bootup
[06:44:24] <Skywise> they compare in the way they both mean you are done computing for the moment
[06:44:43] <shonudo> lol
[06:44:45] <shonudo> indeed
[06:45:06] <aceofspades19> BSOD *is* a kernel panic for the NT kernel, its just the linux kernel and the NT kernel are designed differently
[06:45:34] <wood_quinn> And the NT kernel decided it needed to be blue.
[06:45:36] <wood_quinn> 'cuz.
[06:45:57] <Jdogzz> "when it is called, the machine crashes, and you holler down the hall, 'Hey, reboot it.'"
[06:45:59] <Skywise> blue is just the color it shat

[11:26:00] <bedtime> i've tried using slapt-src but i cannot seem to configure it to accept the main slackware source repo. it only wants to accept slackbuilds
[11:29:57] <KaMii> for what purpose?
[11:31:06] <bedtime> to install packages from source
[11:31:32] <KaMii> just use sbopkg for slackbuilds and slackpkg for slackware

[11:32:07] <bedtime> yeah, i guess i might have to do that. i was hoping for a one stop solution
[11:33:27] <KaMii> none exist that im aware of
[11:33:33] <KaMii> whats wrong with two tools?
[11:33:36] <bedtime> okay :/
[11:33:47] <bedtime> KaMii, just a preference
[11:34:26] <KaMii> i can see a lot of conflict and problems with one tool
[11:34:33] <wizbit> its not a good idea to mix them both, keep them separate

[11:35:01] <KaMii> keeping third party separate from stock really helps with clean-up and upgrades and stability
[11:35:20] <wizbit> aye indeed
[11:35:25] <petar^> guys, i have this quite general question: is it true that keeping your laptop battery charget to 50% will increase its life? and if so, is it possible to do this in Linux?
[11:35:32] <bedtime> okay, well, i got alot to learn about slackware
[11:35:56] <KaMii> petar^: is it a new computer using a new battery?
[11:36:08] <petar^> yes

[11:36:13] <petar^> ThinkPad
[11:36:13] <KaMii> then it doesnt really matter
[11:36:24] <KaMii> battery technology has changed a lot
[11:36:29] <petar^> hope so
[11:36:41] <petar^> and how about discharging it completely like once a month?
[11:36:42] <KaMii> batterys only last about 4-5 years anyway
[11:36:51] <KaMii> yea, i would not recommend doing that
[11:36:57] <petar^> no?
[11:36:58] <KaMii> theres no reason to do that anymore
[11:37:01] <petar^> oh
[11:37:20] <petar^> i goodled around and came upon many oppising advices
[11:37:27] <petar^> googled
[11:37:49] <KaMii> it all depends on what kind of battery you have
[11:38:02] <KaMii> but generally, you dont need to do that kinda stuff anymore
[11:38:16] <KaMii> like i said, a battery is really only good for 4 - 5 years anyway
[11:38:27] <petar^> ok, and i guess it doesnt matter if I keep the lappyplugged in all the time?
[11:38:30] <petar^> yes
[11:38:45] <KaMii> all my laptops always remain plugged in
[11:38:52] <KaMii> for me the battery is just a built in UPS
[11:38:55] <petar^> now i feel better
[11:38:57] <petar^> yes
[11:39:07] <petar^> btw, slackware worked like a charm
[11:39:19] <KaMii> I rarely use my laptops on battery only
[11:39:50] <KaMii> if im in an area that doesnt have a power outlet, i enjoy nature and ignore my computer
[11:40:08] <petar^> this sounds like a nice change

[15:00:17] <TheM4ch1n3> um
[15:00:39] <pink_mist> look at your lilo.conf, and check your /boot to see which one it loaded..
[15:02:09] <TheM4ch1n3> readlink /boot/vmlinuz
[15:02:09] <TheM4ch1n3> vmlinuz-huge-3.2.29

[15:02:55] <bedtime> i get: vmlinuz-huge-smp-3.2.29-smp
[15:03:05] <bedtime> so huge i assume

[15:04:39] <bedtime> well, i've just used Gentoo before, so i know thats different, but i found its not really that long a process
[15:05:35] Action: TheM4ch1n3 trusts Pat and the dev team
[15:05:37] <pink_mist> well sure, I compile my own kernels all the time, but mostly to get newer ones so I can play around with them ... on my servers I don't do that at all unless they have some exotic hardware that require newer kernel
[15:05:53] <bedtime> the difference though is that gentoo uses whats called 'genkernel' and that kinda sets you up for the most part. you just need to tweak a little and maybe add your wireless or video card
[15:06:30] <bedtime> maybe i'll just leave it then

[17:01:54] <sylphie> I would want ipfilter because I am using 13.37 with a 2.6.x kernel, and it is superior to the alternatives escpecially in it's usability
[17:02:15] <pim_> Hey I get this error message: [Sat Jan 12 17:52:00 2013] [error] [client 130.89.133.222] File does not exist: /srv/httpd/htdocs/pics/lightbox/js/scriptaculous.js, referer: http://slacker.student.utwente.nl/pics/pics.html
[17:02:27] <Skywise> does the file exist?
[17:02:38] <pim_>  I was wondering why there is a /srv directory
[17:02:51] <Jdogzz> And to answer your original question, it appears that it would be looking for autoconf.h in the linux subfolder in wherever you extracted the source to.
[17:02:52] <pim_> I always do everything in /var/www/httpd
[17:02:53] <sylphie> the autoconf.h file does not exist at all
[17:02:53] <Skywise> its something new, i don't like it either

[17:05:09] <Skywise> i don't like spreading files all over the place
[17:05:21] <sylphie> iptables is a lot of arcanity for the same results as rather simple ipfilter configs, and then I can share those same configs with my other bsd machines which do have ipfilter
[17:05:37] <Skywise> i think /srv is for static server files or some such nonsense, as if there needs  to be such a place

[17:10:12] <pim_> that is a very useful man page

[17:14:52] <pink_mist> sylphie: but having a compile rely on that is crazy
[17:15:07] <thumbs> there's different schools of thought on the matter.
[17:15:34] <thumbs> I still think /var/lib/mysql is wrong :)
[17:15:37] <Skywise> FLYSWATER, i wouldn't try to repair the drive, i would see if it works on another system, if it does then theres an error in your vm
[17:15:51] <sylphie> thank you pink_mist, I found it in that directory
[17:16:05] <FLYSWATER> Skywise, ive tried it on three different systems
[17:16:43] <Skywise> do you get the same error?
[17:17:21] <FLYSWATER> Yes it gets reconized... but it does not show up in my computer or show up as it use to on slackware

[21:54:08] <Urchlay> TheM4ch1n3: it can be, if I'd included any command line options. I just threw that in there for testing (it's gone now, already)
[21:54:34] <TheM4ch1n3> um, ok
[21:54:57] <TheM4ch1n3> I always 'su -' so I don't really use sudo

[21:55:07] <Urchlay> s/suso/sudo/

[22:05:12] <Urchlay> ...apparently it does, "su - -" is fine.
[22:05:41] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: yes, it does
[22:05:56] <Urchlay> yeah, I tried it
[22:06:15] <Urchlay> dunno why I bothered to even ask the question, it was actually less typing to just try it myself.

[22:11:28] <Urchlay> commas
[22:11:33] <Urchlay> although it works the other way too
[22:14:00] <Jdogzz> Thanks:) Looks like I have fluxbox all nice and tidy now.

[23:29:21] <Urchlay> the prodigy... would clash with my current mood I think (been listening to pink floyd all day)
[23:29:43] <Urchlay> (from what I know of them, the prodigy doesn't really do "mellow", do they?)
[23:33:26] <MLanden> Urchlay: if one considers downtempo/chillout mellow...perhaps..thinking of Prodigy's later stuff
[23:36:30] <TheM4ch1n3> no

[23:42:00] <KaMii> im a firestarter
[23:42:24] <MLanden> TheM4ch1n3: indeed..was thinking like Narayan
[23:42:45] <TheM4ch1n3> pyro mechanic
[23:44:51] <KaMii> meh, i think all this transcoding will take about 2 weeks to complete
[23:45:30] <Urchlay> what are you trying to do?
[23:45:32] <wood_quinn> Probably more than that.
[23:45:47] <KaMii> Urchlay: transcoding everything so it will play on my rasberry pi
[23:46:07] <Urchlay> you get the license key for the hardware decoder?
[23:46:10] <KaMii> i have about 750 gigs worth of my little ponies and fairy princess tv shows you know
[23:46:23] <KaMii> Urchlay: im not paying for software that should be free
[23:46:35] <Urchlay> the fact that 750 gigs of that stuff exists, is kind of disturbing
[23:46:48] <wood_quinn> 2160p
[23:46:53] <KaMii> plus, the transcoding is cutting the file sizes down, and im not losing any quality, so... i think i will keep it
[23:46:57] <Urchlay> ok, so software decoding? you ever get it to play at full framerate?
[23:47:25] <KaMii> im just putting it all over to .h264
[23:48:10] <KaMii> the pi cant do software decoding.... it would take you about 10 hours to watch one episode of southpark
[23:48:19] <wood_quinn> The Tor project really bugs me.
[23:48:30] <wood_quinn> Why would you call a piece of software "Arm"?
[23:48:33] <Urchlay> well, it can't do hardware decoding until you pay for the chip license (which you just said you wouldn't do)

[23:48:52] <KaMii> Urchlay: it can do .h264 on the hardware level
[23:49:00] <Urchlay> so if it's not using software or hardware, what? you smeared it with magic pony snot?
[23:49:11] <KaMii> because thats all free, but the mpeg, they want you to pay for

[23:49:14] <Urchlay> oh, h264 doesn't need a license key? that's good to know
[23:49:50] <KaMii> so i figure, since my transcoding is lowering the file sizes, and not lowering quality, im happy to do it
[23:50:01] <KaMii> putting my i7 to good use
[23:50:37] <KaMii> i just wish I couuld run two instances of handbrake, one for the cpu, and another on the gpu
[23:51:00] <Urchlay> is it all cartoons, or live action too? you probably are losing quality but you'll never notice, for cartoons.
[23:51:13] <KaMii> Urchlay: all kindsa stuff
[23:51:24] <KaMii> but i havent noticed any quality loss
[23:51:26] <TheM4ch1n3> KaMii: moving your porn collection to your RPi ?
[23:51:33] <KaMii> im sure theres a little, but, what do I care?

[23:51:54] <TheM4ch1n3> lol
