[00:08:59] <lombardo> hello
[00:09:13] <lombardo> when is the new slackware coming out?
[00:09:36] <eviljames> Slackware 14.0 has been released.
[00:09:43] <lombardo> when is 15.0 coming out?
[00:10:10] <eviljames> When it's ready.
[00:10:12] <hpg> when it's ready

[00:10:24] <lombardo> when will it be ready?

[00:10:37] <kaleun> 14 just came out, basically.
[00:10:57] <lombardo> hrm
[00:11:20] <eviljames> Yeah, in terms of how often Slackware gets released, 14.0 is all brand new & shiny.
[00:11:27] <Jdogzz> Shiny:)
[00:11:28] <lombardo> serious distributions out there issue a new edition every other 6 months on a fixed date you know......
[00:11:50] <kaleun> Oh, right.. yeah.. the thing is.. Slackware is, like, not very serious.
[00:11:53] <eviljames> hahahahahahaha
[00:12:09] <eviljames> lombardo: seriously flawed distributions time their releases according to the calendar, rather than technical readiness.
[00:12:28] <lombardo> people need new versions my friend
[00:12:41] <eviljames> No, they don't.  They need machines that work every time.
[00:12:44] <lombardo> somebody has to deliver
[00:12:58] <eviljames> bah, let arch users bleed.
[00:12:59] <lombardo> people need something to occupy their minds
[00:13:12] <hpg> the most of them have serious problems after releasing their new version, like Mint 14 ...
[00:13:13] <lombardo> arch? what is it like?
[00:13:15] <eviljames> Hopefully something more important than point releases of random libraries.
[00:13:16] <Jdogzz> You can have your mind occupied and we'll get work done:)
[00:13:22] <bedtime> lol
[00:13:50] <kaleun> Well, like, go and, like, use those other distros that you think are better.
[00:14:10] <eviljames> Indeed, the people who are serious about their computing will still be here when you come back.
[00:14:21] <kaleun> This is sewious.
[00:14:26] <lombardo> kaleun, what is a better distro?
[00:14:42] <eviljames> They're pretty much all better, you should go ask #arch why it's better than Slackware
[00:14:52] <kaleun> lombardo: For you, Ubuntu for sure.. rapid release cycle and lot's of new stuff to play with constantly.
[00:15:08] <kaleun> And I do mean constantly.

[00:15:24] <kaleun> They have, like, new updates every week.
[00:15:28] <kaleun> Sometimes everyday.
[00:15:32] <kaleun> So yeah..
[00:15:37] <lombardo> kaleun, thats what i need
[00:15:48] <lombardo> is arch like that too?
[00:15:55] <kaleun> Yeah.. pretty much.
[00:16:02] <eviljames> yeah, it'll break as often as ubuntu.  maybe more often if you use really bleeding edge stuff.

[00:16:12] <bedtime> arch has even more updates per day in my experience
[00:16:13] <lombardo> hm
[00:16:19] <kaleun> Hm yeah.
[00:16:22] <kaleun> Good point.
[00:16:45] <bedtime> arch has a steep learning curve though, just like slackware
[00:17:05] <kaleun> Ubuntu is kind of hard though.
[00:17:11] <kaleun> It is confusing to us new people.
[00:17:11] <eviljames> better yet, get yourself a conflicting bunch of AURs in there (or PPAs in Ubuntu-Speak) and let the package manager fight itself
[00:17:12] <bedtime> :/
[00:17:13] <hpg> bedtime, even more
[00:17:19] <eviljames> It's kinda like apt-get-kung-fu but uglier to watch.
[00:17:25] <Jdogzz> lol
[00:17:32] <lombardo> i installed it the other day, but deleted right after... it doesnt even have its own automated lilo installer script.. you are supposed to be doing it manually... and i didnt even know so i couldnt boot into it
[00:17:40] <bedtime> setup in arch is more difficult but maintenance in arch is easier
[00:18:17] <bedtime> lombardo, why are you installing lilo on arch and not grub?
[00:18:25] <lombardo> i mean, whichever heh
[00:18:31] <eviljames> If you're only booting Linux, lilo is the sane choice.
[00:18:31] <lombardo> i didnt spend much time with arch

[00:19:29] <lombardo> but their netboot iso is very impressive... 1 mb, and right after boot it connects to DHCP.. it was very impressive for me
[00:19:47] <bedtime> lombardo, arch, gentoo, slackware... are distributions that are tailored for the advanced linux user. usually with a few years of experiance under their belt
[00:20:11] <lombardo> right, arch didnt look very easy
[00:20:23] <eviljames> Slackware: as user friendly as a rattlesnake.
[00:20:36] <lombardo> actually slackware is the only system i dont get lost....
[00:20:50] BrokenCog (~BrokenCog@pdpc/supporter/active/brokencog) joined ##slackware.
[00:20:51] <lombardo> i dont understand debian... and ubuntu is a complete mystery to me behind the GUI
[00:20:58] <bedtime> try ubuntu, mint, or fedora. actually, fedora is quite easy and is bleeding edge. its coming out in a few days. brand new version
[00:21:20] <lombardo> slackware has a beautiful simplicity to it
[00:21:47] <kaleun> Uh huh yup
[00:22:15] <bedtime> sorry to say lombardo, but you seem confused. it seems you want the technical distro but you dont seem to give it enough of a chance to learn. its like you're trying to run when you cant even crawl. can you see this ?
[00:22:34] <lombardo> bedtime, right, i will try arch again
[00:22:47] <kaleun> :-|
[00:22:48] <lombardo> i wonder if it boots with UEFI
[00:22:54] <TommyC> arch -- the crawl stage? :O
[00:23:22] <bedtime> it took me years to be able to understand slackware, not to mention arch. these are meant for advanced users
[00:24:03] <bedtime> well, to get to the point where i was ready to try these distros
[00:24:22] <bedtime> sigh
[00:24:44] <lombardo> RC scripts of slackware are much easier to control than debians.... theirs is much more complicated.... with debian you get the feeling that everything will fall down if you manually edit anything too... and the same for ubuntu too

[02:30:08] <kullix> hello all
[02:32:21] <kullix> using dd is pretty simple for making bootable iso on a thumb drive right?
[02:32:47] <kullix> i always have to use unetbootin or something, and i just need to learn it on dd, but i always have trouble, cuz it doesnt boot
[02:33:25] <tsccof> kullix: only ISO files created using isohybrid are able to be dded
[02:34:14] <wood_quinn> Pretty much any Linux distro anymore offers a USB installer.
[02:34:19] <kullix> oh i didnt know that. well im running Slackware, of course, but i need to make an easy distro, such as Fedora, for a buddy of mine who is sick of windows
[02:34:41] <wood_quinn> Dunno about Fedora, but Ubuntu has USB ones.
[02:34:56] <tsccof> kullix: dd should be just fine. fedora has been using isohybrid for a while now, so you are good with the default LiveCD iso
[02:35:24] <kullix> i followed the directions but still not go, its probably something simple though, its just me :P
[02:35:28] <tsccof> kullix: in fact I remember installing Fedora 14 once using dd
[02:35:35] <kullix> oh ok
[02:35:57] <tsccof> kullix: in general - dd if=<path to iso> of=<device node of your thumb drive>
[02:36:20] <kullix> oh ok cool
[02:36:20] <wood_quinn> If your friend wants an easy Linux, why are you offering Fedora?
[02:36:24] <kullix> that simple lol
[02:36:36] Lky (~Lucky@unaffiliated/lky) left irc: Quit: Lost terminal
[02:37:05] <wood_quinn> Unless you're willing to explain things to him when he's looking at Ubuntu docs and it's not the same it'll be a hassle.
[02:37:05] <kullix> wood_quinn: you know that did cross my mind, considering what you have to do to install flash player. i know he doesnt want to deal with that
[02:37:58] <kullix> so would you guys recommend Ubuntu then? i mean he's straight out of Windows 7 and doesn't want to do much command, he's just fed up with all the windows errors
[02:38:27] <kullix> im familiar with ubuntu, i just went back once i found Slackware a while ago L)
[02:38:30] <kullix> :) *
[02:38:40] <kullix> i mean didnt go back, dammit
[02:38:48] <Jdogzz> I would suggest Linux Mint before I suggest Ubuntu after their recent privacy debacle.
[02:38:49] <tsccof> I'd recommend Linux Mint for a totally new user
[02:39:16] <kullix> ohh good, i was hoping i didnt have to deal with Ubuntu
[02:39:38] <wood_quinn> I'd recommend Mint to, because its motto is "We're not Ubuntu!"
[02:39:55] <kullix> haha thats awesome!
[02:40:01] <kullix> alright im sold on that, thanks guys
[02:41:03] <tsccof> Mint also seemed to be a more stable system in my experience
[02:41:19] <tsccof> I have seen some bad stuff coming from Ubuntu
[02:41:34] <Jdogzz> Their last release kind of tarnished my view of them in that regard, Mint froze for no apparent reason with a light load.
[02:41:42] <tsccof> ugliest error I found was the screen wouldn't refresh after going to runlevel 1
[02:41:44] <Jdogzz> And this was after they claimed to have fixed that bug.
[02:42:04] <kullix> oh man
[02:42:28] <tsccof> supposedly a plymouth issue, the one I had on ubuntu, but hey, it's their system
[02:42:39] <Jdogzz> But they're pretty diligent about fixing their bugs, they don't release several new releases while leaving the same obvious bug unpatched.
[02:43:14] <tsccof> Jdogzz: do you mean mint or ubuntu?
[02:44:30] <Jdogzz> Mint of course:)
[02:44:55] <Jdogzz> In Ubuntu I can think of at least one bug that almost any new user will find out of the box.

[02:45:18] <tsccof> Ubuntu has a lot of value in terms of getting new users to the UNIX land
[02:45:40] <tsccof> and them they mature and move along to the really good stuff
[02:45:57] <tsccof> it's a valuable thing, but not an entirely great system in general, imho
[02:46:01] <tsccof> what do you think?
[02:46:03] <kullix> Linux Mint KDE should suffice for a fresh windows switcher, right?

[02:46:58] <gnisho> My experience with ubuntu is watching people with the right mindset and plenty of experience waste countless hours trying to make ubuntu's half broken tools work properly because "It's the distro that's getting support."
[02:47:00] <tsccof> I have to say Debian kicks Ubuntu's arse in terms of quality
[02:47:20] <malus> Anyone have an opinion on LFS (Linux From Scratch) project?
[02:47:21] <Jdogzz> kullix: Actually you might let your friend decide that with a live cd of the different ones. I've heard Cinammon is the best desktop they have in their releases.
[02:47:27] <wood_quinn> I prefer software that was released from upstream before three years ago.
[02:48:29] <tsccof> wood_quinn: from Debian, you mean?
[02:48:30] <kullix> Jdogzz: interesting, will look into that thanks
[02:48:48] <Soul_keeper> what is your guy's favorite network benchmarking tool, if any ?
[02:49:02] <wood_quinn> Depends what you want to benchmark.
[02:49:07] <Soul_keeper> i'm wondering if there is a good one for latency specifically
[02:49:14] <wood_quinn> I use ping.

[02:49:34] <Soul_keeper> probably not even worth benchmarking I suppose
[02:49:50] <wood_quinn> tsccof: I just don't understand Debian's stance on stability vs. new software.
[02:50:13] <wood_quinn> Or rather, I don't understand why they lean so far to the stability that most of their software is ancient.
[02:50:25] <wood_quinn> I much prefer the way Pat does things.

[02:52:52] <tsccof> it works awesomely well, it's by far the most flexible software management system we have for linux at the moment.. that and portage

[02:54:26] <tsccof> my only real complain about debian is that it should be more vanilla... that would help getting support from upstream developers... because using php 5.4.4 with a bunch of patches for fixing bugs is not the same as running PHP 5.4.10 with the same bugs fixed
[02:55:35] corretico (~luis@190.211.93.38) left irc: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[02:56:15] <wood_quinn> Plus, since upstream developers know how heavily patched things are on your average Debian-based distro, good luck getting a bug report through.

[03:58:23] <wood_quinn> What software, out of curiosity?
[03:58:39] <Sylphie> ipfilter , both 4.1 and 5.1
[03:58:45] <wood_quinn> Ah.
[03:58:54] <wood_quinn> Well Linux doesn't typically use ipfilter anymore.
[03:58:58] <wood_quinn> It uses iptables.
[03:59:09] <Sylphie> iptables is too arcane to be practical, and netfilter is worse
[03:59:13] <Skywise> yeah, same syntax
[03:59:35] <wood_quinn> For basic tasks, I find iptables to make sense.
[03:59:46] <tsccof> I use iptables all the time
[03:59:58] <Skywise> well you can make it complicated if you want too
[04:00:17] <Sylphie> really compkucated
[04:00:42] <tsccof> Sylphie: as I said, kernel headers in general expose its API.. even if you find the header file you are looking for, it no longer makes sense, unless you are running a kernel 2.2.X as well
[04:00:42] <Skywise> but i use mine as a nat which isn't all that complicated, but its not simple either
[04:01:24] <Sylphie> tsccof, that's the answer I was expecting, but I thought I'd ask on the off chance
[04:02:33] <tsccof> Sylphie: if you upgrade your kernel headers packages, and then go and try to compile some software using glibc, and what glibc included from the old headers actually differs from what is in memory(the kernel), you have to either rebuild or upgrade glibc

[04:03:24] <tsccof> Sylphie: the same happens here.. if this header file you are looking for is kernel API-dependant, it won't work... you are running 2.6.X or 3.X
[04:03:58] <Sylphie> from what I've been reading, iptables will be discontinued soon anyways in favor of netfilter
[04:04:17] <tsccof> Sylphie: suppose this header declares some kernel functions... the ipfilter builds, but can't call these functions since they are no longer available in 2.6.X or 3.X

[04:04:46] <Sylphie> I see what you're saying, it's just unfortunate
[04:04:59] <tsccof> I recommend you use iptables or netfilter
[04:05:12] <tsccof> since you just said iptables will be discontinued, maybe jump for netfilter already
[04:05:23] <Sylphie> iptables is already planned on being phased out
[04:05:41] <tsccof> scott71: I didn't get your lilo.conf... paste it somewhere online
[04:05:45] <Sylphie> netfilter makes you practically reinvent the wheel for every config

[04:52:14] <shonudo> it's an inherited f'up
[04:52:43] <FrankD> yeah, but the new GPUs don't share much of the codebase with the old GPUs
[04:53:15] <FrankD> theyre dropping support for 3000/4000 series iirc
[04:53:36] <tsccof> nvidia has great support for legacy cards
[04:53:42] <FrankD> yeah
[04:53:53] <tsccof> I replaced my ATI with an nvidia specifically because of this.. fglrx wouldn't support my old radeon
[04:54:36] <FrankD> easier to get VDPAU working too rather than the abstraction layer with VAAPI you have to run with AMD stuff
[04:54:53] <shonudo> amd needs to get it's game up

[10:55:56] <jrodger> Has anyone looked into doing a security package type install for Slackware?
[10:56:01] <wood_quinn_> Not for me. And it kept happening to start while I was in the middle of playing Minecraft so I ditched it.
[10:56:23] <KaMii> jrodger: define security package type install

[10:56:56] <wood_quinn_> I could.
[10:56:59] <KaMii> and why are you _ after your name?
[10:57:02] <KaMii> ghost?

[10:57:52] <wood_quinn> Master-Passeli: It already is by default, and I even ionice upped Minecraft.
[10:57:58] <wood_quinn> I blame Java.
[10:58:04] <KaMii> how often do you guys slocate anyway?
[10:58:06] <Master-Passeli> java?
[10:58:08] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Nope. I just run a middle relay.
[10:58:13] <Master-Passeli> how java is related?
[10:58:17] <wood_quinn> Master-Passeli: It's an easy scapegoat :)
[10:58:27] <jrodger> Kamii: I've been doing security courses / work and find that distros like backbox & pentoo are available but I don't feel the adoration as I do for Slackware but I need some of the packages that these lesser distros have

[10:59:01] <KaMii> its not a 'secure' distro
[10:59:21] <KaMii> and besides you only boot into blackbox using a live dvd to run those tests
[10:59:25] <KaMii> so, just use it
[10:59:33] <wood_quinn> Cat's moaning in his sleep. Should I poke him awake to make him stop?
[10:59:41] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[10:59:46] <KaMii> lol, awww leave him alone
[10:59:50] <jrodger> The pen testing stuff is what I'd like to see available on Slackware so I don't need keep rebooting into them
[10:59:54] <KaMii> maybe hes dreaming of chasing mice and hes winning
[11:00:14] <KaMii> jrodger: qemu/kvm
[11:00:17] <wood_quinn> jrodger: All of the software available on your average penetration testing distro is also available on Slack.
[11:00:30] <KaMii> or that, just grab the sbo
[11:00:31] <wood_quinn> Much of it might already have buildscripts on SBo.
[11:00:37] <wood_quinn> Damnit.
[11:01:33] <jrodger> woodquinn: I don't suggest poking the cat, Dad's a vet and I've seen cats that get startled awake.....although it was fun watching them lap the room at 3feet high around the walls
[11:02:10] <jrodger> True, I could list the packages and build them myself....might give that a go...., cheers

[15:09:25] <BrokenCog> ah, but that is a big IF.
[15:09:44] <nofra> Ya....  We have ALOT of COBOL here but I work with none
[15:09:47] <smed> I hear there is a "MicroFocus" mode that would be handy for me.
[15:10:06] <smed> I dont either, been holding off for 10 years because, well, it's COBOL.....
[15:10:21] <smed> but I'm starting to wonder if it wouldn't behoove me to invest some time on it.
[15:10:25] <nofra> Eh, I use Perl (or BASH) for everything I need
[15:10:39] <nofra> It's quick and easy
[15:10:44] <smed> our ERP application is COBOL.
[15:11:11] <smed> our support provider is raping us and trying to migrate all its users to another ERP application
[15:11:16] <smed> so I see support ending in the near future.
[15:11:22] <nofra> We're a government agency that had everything on a 370, we have ALOT of COBOL
[15:11:37] <smed> knowing COBOL and understanding our application bette would buy me a ticket for life here, first class.
[15:11:45] <smed> oh yeah - I'll bet.
[15:11:52] <nofra> smed: Sounds like you have a task....
[15:11:59] <smed> congrats - it's the dead language nobody wants to kill.
[15:12:05] <nofra> load up OpenCOBOL and go to town
[15:12:16] <smed> I might tinker with it in the near future.
[15:12:41] <nofra> just don't expect to write a 3d MMORPG in it
[15:12:43] <BrokenCog> what happens when the server it runs on goes kaput?  all things COBOL are out the window.
[15:12:59] <nofra> Huh?
[15:13:06] <nofra> Put it on another server
[15:13:32] <nofra> We're running alot of our COBOL stuff on x86 machines
