[02:09:02] <KaMii> is it possible to make a guest virtaual qemu session connect its network through a proxy on the host system?  like if tor is running on the host on port 5856 can you force the guest's network traffic through that port?

[03:14:44] <shonudo> but the vlc thing, i don't know what's up with that
[03:14:54] <Skywise> me neither, its got some habits that bug me
[03:15:32] <n1x4> load by file extion --> add to playlist
[03:15:33] <Skywise> like it won't just queue files up if you use their interface, it begins to play what you selected or it just stops playing what it was
[03:15:45] <shonudo> well, win can't be that much different -- there must be file associations somewhere
[03:15:53] <shonudo> good luck with that
[03:16:46] <shonudo> in soviet russia, win does what YOU want
[03:16:53] <Skywise> theres even an option that says enqueue files when in one instance mode and i have allow only one instance
[03:17:19] <Skywise> and vlc can't play ape files right
[03:17:31] <shonudo> okay, that soviet russia thing is a joke; the expected would be "in soviet russia, you do what win wants"
[03:17:36] <shonudo> but that's what happens here
[03:17:46] <Skywise> you have to seek to :01 to start it playing for each ape file
[03:17:53] <shonudo> it's f'ed
[03:18:06] <shonudo> that's not any good
[03:18:10] <Skywise> yeah, those guys are asking for trouble
[03:19:02] <shonudo> let the devs know about it, i guess
[03:19:30] <Skywise> i'd rather sit and fume and just expect them to know its a problem
[03:19:51] <shonudo> ah, like a bad relationship
[03:20:43] <Skywise> yeah, cause i have another player i like better, but it doesn't work with internet radio, so i use vlc mostly
[03:20:45] <shonudo> don't understand it trying to play an oddball file like that
[03:21:02] <shonudo> unless you open that file with vlc
[03:21:06] <shonudo> which isn't what you did
[03:21:15] <Skywise> it shouldn't even load anything it doesn't support, even then it should be masked
[03:21:23] <Skywise> but yeah, i just told it to load a folder
[03:21:33] <Skywise> it should filter out the non playable files

[04:53:32] <D1ver> So, newbie kernel config question..
[04:54:52] <D1ver> if I grab the config for generic-3.2.29, I should be able to apply it to 3.2.37 without any issues right? (or testing/config-generic-3.4.11 to 3.4.28?)
[04:56:40] <jgeboski> yes, those are just stable trees, no new options will be present
[04:57:15] Rat409 (~greg@bb-205-209-95-37.gwi.net) joined ##slackware.
[04:57:22] <D1ver> ok, great thanks.
[04:57:41] <jgeboski> if you're going from "major" versions, use `make oldconfig`
[04:58:04] <D1ver> so 3.2.x -> 3.4 would be a major version?
[04:58:10] <jgeboski> correct
[04:58:14] <D1ver> cool

[05:03:22] <D1ver> so is 'slackware best practice' to build new kernels as releases become available, or do most people just stick with the default stock kernel?
[05:04:01] <KaMii> i would say it depends on the person and the need
[05:05:14] <jgeboski> I'm personally one to use the latest, however, there's absolutely no need most of the time

[05:07:54] <D1ver> yea fair enough. There isn't anything the default kernel isn't doing for me.. but other distros seem to release minor kernel updates/patches, which i assume contain security updates, so i was curious
[05:09:29] <draven> does slackware announce any security issues for the kernel, or should we follow the kernel dev for notes regarding any need to update the kernel?
[05:09:31] <d4wnr4z0r>  other distros patch their kernels seven ways to sunday, which creates for them a huge maintenance burden
[05:09:35] <KaMii> well if its a major security issue, there will be a slackware patch released, im sure... otherwise.  most are probably going to be driver updates

[06:15:32] <KaMii> there was no liquid in it, so it must be finie
[06:15:35] <Sod> ah
[06:15:39] <KaMii> yea, i made fajitas
[06:15:46] <KaMii> and no fire or burning
[06:15:55] <KaMii> except i burned my finger... they get hot
[06:16:05] <Skywise> i'm not sure how you can tell when spoiled food goes bad, but i think if nothing else it would be stale
[06:16:40] <KaMii> i think it would smell and have mold growing on it
[06:16:48] <Skywise> maybe
[06:16:56] <KaMii> i googled it
[06:17:06] <KaMii> they said it will smell, have mold growing and be in liquid
[06:17:11] <KaMii> and none of that is the case
[06:17:16] <KaMii> so... if i die... you know why
[06:17:35] <Skywise> no, i'm just pretty sure it doesn't keep for 6 months
[06:18:00] <KaMii> i have a magic refrigerator?

[06:18:17] <Skywise> well, those things just can't spontaneously grow
[06:18:24] <KaMii> and sour cream is just rotton milk anyway
[06:18:33] <wood_quinn> If you've never opened it, it could quite possibly be fine.
[06:18:33] <Skywise> if none landed in it while it was open, they can't colonize it
[06:18:40] <wood_quinn> I personally wouldn't chance it though.

[12:54:37] <elderK> Hey guys.
[12:54:51] <elderK> What's theusual way these days to setup a tiny install of Slackware?
[12:54:52] <elderK> Like say,
[12:54:58] <elderK> X11, development tools, firefox
[12:55:01] <elderK> and that's about it.
[12:55:27] <elderK> I can hand pick and get something running but I'm exploiting the fact that programs (or plugins) with missing dependencies aren't used by me.
[12:55:40] <ventYl> usually you install everything
[12:55:47] <ventYl> especially if you are newbie
[12:56:26] <elderK> Why in God's name would you install everything?
[12:56:32] <elderK> I do not need Apache, I do not need MySQL, etc, etc.
[12:56:40] <elderK> The same for Samba, Procmail and hte rest.
[12:56:43] <ventYl> because it's fast and you are sure you have all depencies
[12:57:04] <elderK> Note that I did say "tiny" install.
[12:57:09] <elderK> I mean, <4G installed.
[12:57:17] <elderK> That's without the inclusion of swap, of course.
[12:57:34] <ventYl> you still can remove useless thing afterwards
[12:58:11] <ventYl> probably you'll experience less problems this way than with approach installing minimal install first and then adding required libraries
[12:58:14] <pink_mist> elderK: the thing is, 99.999% or the time when people have not done a full install, and come in this channel asking for help because something isn't working, it's because they have missed a dependency ... so this channel rather dislikes people who don't do full installs
[12:58:19] <pink_mist> it gets tiresome quick
[12:58:57] <shonudo> it usually gets impossible quick
[12:59:06] crn_ (~crn@host109-150-192-19.range109-150.btcentralplus.com) joined ##slackware.
[12:59:12] <pink_mist> elderK: but if you're comfortable with doing it, you're mostly on your own
[12:59:27] <pink_mist> shonudo: especially when they don't install 'tar'
[12:59:47] <shonudo> pink_mist: that was the one i was thinking of too
[12:59:52] <shonudo> that was... different
[13:00:02] <pink_mist> indeed ;)
[13:00:04] <elderK> Well, yes.
[13:00:17] <elderK> I usually write a few scripts that determine the dependencies.
[13:00:35] <elderK> What libraries are missing? Create an index from the install media, to tell me what files are provided by what package.
[13:00:51] <elderK> Install what I need, with supervision ,so that I know that I'm not installing say, QT only for wpa_gui, when I don't use it.
[13:01:11] <elderK> But that itself doesn't save you from the craziness - X11, being modular and all, can be a real bitch.
[13:01:26] <elderK> X can run along mostly happy without a lot of stuff that could possibly be needed.
[13:01:26] Divel (~Daniel@unaffiliated/divel) left irc: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[13:01:29] <ventYl> some depencies can't be determined like this
[13:01:59] <elderK> Exactly.
[13:01:59] Divel (~Daniel@unaffiliated/divel) joined ##slackware.
[13:02:17] <elderK> That's why I was wondering if anyone knew of a reference? Like, that says what's needed by what when it comes to X.
[13:02:19] <elderK> Or something.
[13:02:35] <ventYl> but, afaik, there's external depency record file containing internal depencies of slackware packages somewhere
[13:02:40] <elderK> Otherwise, it's very trial-and-error. And that's fine - I've made small systems before with this approach. Just, it's time consuming and I was wondering if there's a better way.
[13:02:41] <ventYl> or at least it was
[13:02:51] <ventYl> for use with tools like slapt-get
[13:03:08] <elderK> Yeah.
[13:03:12] <elderK> Swaret, too.
[13:03:25] <pink_mist> sorry elderK, but *I* at least don't know of anything like what you're asking for ... trial and error would be your best bet I think
[13:03:57] <elderK> :( Damn.
[13:04:10] <elderK> The dependencies needed now are WAY more than they use to be, ConsoleKit, DeviceKit, etc.
[13:04:40] <elderK> Afaik, simple things like dwm (tiling window manager) don't need ConsoleKit or DeviceKit.
[13:06:10] <ventYl> probably nobody really knows what these depencies are

[13:09:20] <ventYl> foreign packages usually have information about depencies embedded in way it's full backwards compatible with plain slackware package format
[13:09:34] <ventYl> the only thing one have to do is to create these informations
[13:11:03] <hiptobecubic> Man, the scrolling behaviour in rxvt is *fucking stupid*.
[13:11:44] <hiptobecubic> normally it automatically jumps to the bottom when there's new output. fine. there's an option scrollTtyOutput though
[13:11:45] <elderK> hiptobecubic: what behavior? YOu can customize it quite extensively.
[13:11:55] <elderK> Scroll on keypress, on buffer, etc.
[13:11:57] <hiptobecubic> If you set it to false, then it won't jump on output

[13:12:15] <hiptobecubic> BUT IT WILL STILL SCROLL THE TEXT "UNDERNEATH" YOU

[13:12:27] <hiptobecubic> and you have no hope of reading anything
[13:12:32] <elderK> less?
[13:12:36] <elderK> Xoff?
[13:12:37] <hiptobecubic> you just move your sliding window up
[13:12:38] <elderK> Xon?
[13:12:54] <hiptobecubic> and the text slides by underneath it
[13:13:02] <hiptobecubic> why would anything *ever* want that? EVER?
[13:13:13] <elderK> Good point.
[13:13:18] <hiptobecubic> hey I really want to know what it looks like two screens above the bottom at all times
[13:13:20] <elderK> There are a few other scroll related things?
[13:13:33] <elderK> Same here, hip. Very useful when compiling things :)
[13:13:57] <hiptobecubic> that's exactly why i want this to be sensible. I start some long build and i want to know if the configure part spit out something important
[13:13:59] sencha (~brad@184-222-35-142.pools.spcsdns.net) joined ##slackware.
[13:14:01] <hiptobecubic> but i can't go look
[13:14:08] <hiptobecubic> because the text never stops moving
[13:14:10] <hiptobecubic> no matter what
[13:14:38] <hiptobecubic> you can pause compilation with ctrl+z (sometimes) but that is hard a solution

[13:14:39] <elderK> :( I wish I could hel pman.
[13:14:47] <elderK> Yeah, that IS a shit solution.
[13:14:51] <elderK> Have you tried using GNU Screen?
[13:15:07] <elderK> Runninga buil din there, oyu can scroll up as much as you like - and it's FROZEN until it's done
[13:15:10] <elderK> like, the "copy" mode,
[13:15:18] <elderK> you can navigate until your hearts content :)
[13:15:32] <hiptobecubic> I don't run everything in screen. Maybe i should
[13:15:41] <elderK> I started to do that for this reason, tbh.
[13:16:14] <hiptobecubic> although I don't want to. It was hard enough getting everything to work properly when i switched to urxvt instead of xfce4-terminal (which does this scrolling thing sensibly, btw)
[13:16:48] cmyster_ (~cmyster@94.159.255.145) joined ##slackware.

[13:16:57] <hiptobecubic> i hope not
[13:16:59] <hiptobecubic> lets see
[13:17:06] <elderK> Make sure to have scroll with tty, off.
[13:17:09] <elderK> well
[13:17:10] <elderK> scroll on output

[13:17:17] <elderK> If you're at the bottom, you see, it should scroll anyway.

[13:18:36] <hiptobecubic> but when i want to "unstick" it from the bottom and just look at something while it continues outputting down below, there's no hope
[13:18:45] <elderK> keeps scrolling?
[13:18:58] <elderK> :( Yeah.
[13:19:21] <elderK> Sorry man, that's all I can offer you :(

[14:46:01] <nofra> Zordrak: I have vbox running on 14....  it's doable
[14:46:08] <kikinovak> Zordrak: just install the 32-bit compatibility layer, and it will work. Means you can install 64-bit guests.

[15:23:03] <jorgito> hello, after turning on my slackware 14 64, after several minutes the whole system hangs
[15:23:39] <jorgito> sorry,found in google the possible cause
[15:25:17] <nerdix> smed, I know a computer science teacher who uses slackware in class for his students, slack is a very good base to learn about Linux and to start own modifications based on it
[15:25:56] <smed> someone earlier was decalring that they are teaching a class on Systems Administration and using Slack 14......
[15:26:13] <nerdix> smed, you know how things are done in slackware, you basically should't have problems to get things working in other Linux distributions as well
[15:26:14] <smed> I'm wondering what school, in particular....out of curiousity
[15:26:28] <smed> but you might not be able to find a job as a Windows admin....
[15:26:49] <smed> I was mainly curious as to why they chose to use Slack as a tool to teach systems administration....
[15:26:59] <smed> when it completely ignores the Windows world.
[15:27:09] <smed> which seems, short-sighted.
[15:27:30] <smed> and for the record - I dont disagree...it's just very contrary to my experiences.
[15:27:52] <nerdix> smed, why not at least thos guys will have a understanding about ports, routing, protocols and system configuration...
[15:28:46] Soul_keeper (1000@wsip-70-166-30-4.sd.sd.cox.net) joined ##slackware.
[15:28:56] <smed> sure, but will those same students actually have an inkling of what to do in on a Windows server.
[15:29:36] <smed> it just seems weird for a school to make that decision, they are effectively ignoring half of the job postings out there for a Sys Admin.
[15:29:40] <smed> probably more than half.
[15:29:50] <nerdix> smed, on the other hand windows senior engineers seems to lack of some knowledge what happens behind the fancy gui tools they're using, Slackware users tend to have a better idea about what's going on under the hood...
[15:29:59] <smed> seem?
[15:30:11] <smed> I've worked with so many who are completely undereducated
[15:30:17] <smed> that's besides the point.
[15:30:40] <smed> any Linux Admin who works in the field could tell you that Windows Admins usually lack a LOT of skills a Linux admin takes for granted.
[15:31:00] <smed> a perfect example is to survey a dozen Windows admins and quiz them on their TCP/IP skills - most are nearly clueless.
[15:31:01] <nofra> smed: Like how to spell ls
[15:31:21] <nerdix> smed, ther ARE exceptions but you are right
[15:31:28] <smed> what did I spell wrong?
[15:31:38] <smed> usually I'm a good speller...
[15:31:46] <nofra> smed: It was a joke... not you
[15:31:49] <smed> ahh
[15:32:02] <nofra> Drink less coffee
[15:32:22] <smed> well in any event....I think it's intriguing that a school somewhere chose to use Slack to teach Systems Administration
[15:32:42] <smed> however I'm not sure you're fully preparing those graduates for the workplace
[15:32:44] <nofra> I think it's refreshing
[15:33:03] <smed> they will be excellent Linux administrators......but Windows administration will be confusing and foreign
[15:33:10] <nofra> smed: I think Slackware would better prepare
[15:33:18] <smed> and good luck trying to escape Windows in the wild, it cannot be done.
[15:33:24] <nofra> Think of how much you learn just to get soundcards to work
[15:33:38] <nofra> lsmod lspci rmmod modprobe
[15:33:39] <smed> until a Windows Domain controller has a problem...then what will they do?
[15:33:55] <nofra> smed: Click on an icon to fix it
[15:34:01] <smed> hah - not that simple.
[15:34:06] <fuzzix> smed: Install Samba and LDAP
[15:34:15] <smed> Windows doesn't necessarily give you all the tools you need - you need to know where to find those tools
[15:34:35] <smed> and you also need to know, that you might need to go looking elsewhere for some of those tools.
[15:34:52] <smed> which is not common knowledge, unless you are a seasoned Windows administrator.....
[15:35:05] <smed> then you are aware that your toolkit is missing key ingredients.
[15:35:21] <smed> it's a strange paradigm that will be frustrating for non-Windows admins.
[15:35:35] <wood_quinn> 's/ might//'
[15:36:10] <smed> Linux admins usually have the tools they need to troubleshoot.
[15:36:23] <wood_quinn> "What do you mean it doesn't ship with sed?"
[15:36:24] <smed> Windows admins *often* do not

[15:49:23] <hpg> hackedhead, but why there are no such error messages under Linux Mint?
[15:49:56] <wood_quinn> Because Linux Mint isn't Ubuntu.
[15:50:04] <hpg> LOL
[15:50:15] <hackedhead> hpg: maybe the drivers in use are different?
[15:50:17] <smed> nofra - they live in the neighors shed, which the neighbors leave open all year round
[15:50:25] <hackedhead> hpg: compare the kernels being used?
[15:51:01] <hackedhead> smed: maybe you should be shooting things that aren't even on your property to begin with?
[15:51:06] <hackedhead> shouldn't*
[15:51:07] <hackedhead> lol
[15:51:17] <smed> well I live in the city, I shouldn't be shooting things period.
[15:51:20] <hackedhead> lol
[15:51:23] <hpg> hackedhead, both are 3.2.x - if Mint counts the same way as Slackware does ...
[15:51:34] <wood_quinn> It probably doesn't.
[15:51:36] <hackedhead> the .x may be important
[15:51:38] <wood_quinn> It's not Ubuntu.
[15:51:45] <smed> but I do have a particularly quiet air-rifle that wouldn't arouse any suspicion
[15:51:58] <nofra> Yeah, I'm in the don't shoot cats/dogs camp
[15:52:04] <smed> and I could take a head-shot with little trouble at that range.
[15:52:23] <Skywise> you  should call pest control, if you shoot 'em you could get charged with animal cruelty

[15:53:35] <smed> our shelfters are full...animal control is useless - it's a long story
[15:53:40] <nofra> BUT you better make sure that they aren't your neighbor's outdoor cats...
[15:53:41] <smed> bottom line, I'm not going to shoot them.
[15:53:48] <smed> but it's crossed my mind.
[15:54:35] <nofra> I know that if they go to animal control, they will probably be put to sleep BUT, it's still 'more correct' than for you to decide to put them down.
[15:54:56] <smed> actually - we have a no-kill shelter...
[15:55:00] <smed> it's pretty amazing really
[15:55:19] <nofra> No-kill shelters are bad because they fill then they turn people away
[15:55:20] <smed> but they are ful, recent news articles have appealed to the public for more funding to expand.
[15:55:27] <nofra> They are ALWAYS full
[15:55:29] <smed> nofa - exactly
[15:55:37] <Sandman1> hm
[15:55:45] <nofra> So it turns into stray welfare
[15:55:49] <Sandman1> installpkg has a -tagfile flag
[15:55:54] <smed> our animal control guys wont take the cats unelss someone reports possible rabies or erratic behaviour
[15:56:07] <smed> it's been discussed.
[15:56:31] <smed> once the young males become mature and start to wander, they will be in the road.
[15:56:40] <smed> which would be this Spring.
[15:56:45] <nofra> smed: Prolly
[15:56:50] <nofra> That's life

[16:01:06] <hackedhead> yeah, no kill shelters only sort of work, they need to have a huge adoption market/marketing to be anywhere near sustainable.
[16:01:20] <hackedhead> so they have actual turnover.
[16:01:28] <hackedhead> but mostly that doesn't happen.
[16:01:45] <smed> we rescued our dog, so my wife has been involved with a rescue for a while, good people, sad situation that never seems to get better.

[17:15:16] <Skywise> tag files are for packages on the install disk, slackpkg is for additional and/or update packages
[17:15:33] <Sandman1> i have a folder called tagfile/{a,ap,etc} with a file tagfile that i edited
[17:17:25] <nofra> Sandman1: Slax?
[17:17:46] <nofra> tagfiles are a pain..  I like Slackpkg templates
[17:18:21] <Sandman1> I will have to check it out
[17:18:24] <Skywise> i'm gonna go get a sandwich
[17:18:56] <Sandman1> Does slax support PXE
[17:18:59] <wood_quinn> Sandman1: What problems are you having?
[17:19:09] <Skywise> we don't know about slax
[17:19:25] <Sandman1> after selecting my path for my tagfiles it just skips to the end saying installation finished without installing anything
[17:20:34] <Skywise> are your paths correct?
[17:20:42] <nofra> Slax does have a tiny footprint
[17:20:52] <Sandman1> hm

[19:35:15] <hackedhead> if its like icecast

[19:37:31] <pink_mist> ananke: and what backend supports streaming the artwork to said clients?
[19:37:39] <ananke> pink_mist: plex. itunes.
[19:37:46] <hackedhead> pink_mist: plex is a server as well.
[19:37:50] <pink_mist> is plex both? oh
[19:37:52] <pink_mist> I see
[19:37:57] <ananke> plex is a client/server model
[19:37:59] <hackedhead> but um. plex, itunes...
[19:38:08] <hackedhead> that it?
[19:38:14] tribeca (~naitso@adsl-ull-144-105.47-151.net24.it) left irc: Quit: bye
[19:38:33] <ananke> hackedhead: i do admit, i can't name others off the top of my head
[19:38:47] <hackedhead> itunes is questionable, because it advertises itself as a library manager, not just a streaming daemon...
[19:38:57] hoobop (~user@unaffiliated/hoobop) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[19:39:02] <hackedhead> plex is a legit alternative.... btu that's "one" not "tons"
[19:39:17] <hackedhead> so saying that it's on mpd that it doesn't support it, is pushing it at best
[19:39:27] <ananke> hackedhead: i think the point here was that being a 'daemon' has nothing to do with artificially limiting functionality
[19:39:39] <hackedhead> i mean, i wish it did. but it's hardly "lacking a common feature" if we can only name two that do it.
[19:39:48] Jospeh^Sod (~Sentinel@74.121.252.200) left ##slackware.
[19:40:06] <hackedhead> ananke: depends on what you mean by 'artificial'
[19:40:07] <ananke> still, the fact is that such solutions do exist
[19:40:17] <hackedhead> ananke: the mpd goals are pretty well explained.
[19:40:19] <ananke> hackedhead: artificial, meaning without merit in this case
[19:40:25] <ananke> hackedhead: i'm not debating it
[19:40:36] <fuzzix> ananke: Yeah, though my wackiest use of RDP was to dialup to a windows domain across town, RDP to a jump off NT box to telnet to a red hat box. I suggested they upgrade to ssh, allow remote access from us but that was deemed "insecure"
[19:40:37] <ananke> hackedhead: i'm fully aware of what mpd can do, and what it claims to do
[19:40:53] <ananke> hackedhead: what i don't agree is pink_mist's claim that just because it's a 'daemon', it cannot do it
[19:41:04] <hackedhead> fair enough. that's true.

[19:41:22] <hackedhead> there's no technical reason they couldn't implement an artwork comm protocol.
[19:41:25] <hackedhead> had they a desire.
[19:41:49] <ananke> bingo
[19:42:01] <wizbit> daemon: daemonized!
[19:42:57] <pink_mist> ananke: I did amend my statement to specify that I meant a 'music player daemon' ... it's meant for playing music ... gotta be careful about scope creep
[19:43:22] <ananke> pink_mist: and plex is meant to play music [and video].
[19:43:23] <pink_mist> if you want to do more with it, rename it
[19:43:34] <fuzzix> ananke: Again, in a pinch, TightVNC with reasonable compression might do the trick.
[19:43:56] <ananke> fuzzix: yeah, but it's just not as elegant/easy as X11 or RDP :)
[19:44:04] <ananke> i wish NX was more common

[19:44:59] <wizbit> IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[19:45:00] <d4wnr4z0r> NX is nice, though generally I find x11 tunnelling to be sufficient for most needs

[21:00:49] <Sandman1> Slackware has helped me so much, I have learned a _TON_ and I can do a lot

[21:19:58] <eviljames> Someone have a link that explains which particular mfg runs we're talking about?
[21:20:13] <wood_quinn> And the function of the manufacturing constraints is to reduce the need for innovation.
[21:20:31] <smed> so, that bitchin Antec case I've been saving for a Summer project is a waste of time???

[21:25:09] <machicola> evanton, that was great. seems like his life has been one big roll of this thing leading to that
[21:25:24] <machicola> and , i like that it started late, makes me not feel so bad :P
[21:25:28] <wood_quinn> Refusing to create new technologies because it's too damn hard is a marketing ploy.
[21:25:29] <hackedhead> wood_quinn: yes. which is why later intel runs will be going back to pins for at least one more product cycle after the BGA one
[21:25:33] <nofra> I got FOUR killers

[21:27:50] <Sandman1>  BGA meaning?
[21:27:55] <eviljames> wood_quinn: You cannot prove a negative - only affirm a positive.  So the claim that cold fusion has yielded nothing is thus far true.  The claim that it has yielded something is unproven (and for the moment false, but that fact is subject to change)
