[01:10:04] <wood_quinn> I suggest you ask your mother to tell them it's 8PM and time for you to go to bed so they need to be quiet.
[01:10:07] <TommyC> guzzan0: There's a USB installer.
[01:10:08] <ananke> Demon_Fox_: sounds like you need to go visit 4chan, instead of asking here

[01:13:19] <TommyC> but that would be like saying "Wal-Mart is a worse Target."
[01:13:21] <ananke> TommyC: if 4chan is merely a 'worse reddit', then hitler is just a 'worse obama'. it's a joke at your understatement
[01:14:03] <ananke> saying 4chan is a 'worse reddit' is an understatement of the year. reddit has nothing on 4chan in terms of low life scum concentration

[01:18:51] <Skywise> we have to stop people from wanting to committ mass murder or domestic terrorism

[01:19:15] <Demon_Fox_> cover up being the least likely

[02:04:03] <ewong_> yeah..  less pain.. and I think I just installed 14.0 ontop of a 13.37 installation..  *sigh*
[02:04:43] <macavity> then you need to consult with the CHANCES_AND_HINTS.TXT and UPGRADE.TXT files
[02:05:22] <macavity> as you need to remove quite a few packages that has either been renamed, removed or split into several smaller ones
[02:05:36] <doug713705> now that 14.0 has been installed on top 13.37, upgrading it to 14.0 would not work as expected
[02:05:47] <wood_quinn> 13.37 comes with 1.2.5
[02:05:54] <wood_quinn> So sounds about right.
[02:06:29] <ewong_> er I meant installed 14.0 x/xap on top of a 13.37 system
[02:06:57] <macavity> that will not work as expected
[02:07:05] <macavity> .. unless you dont expect it to work :P
[02:07:50] <ewong_> heh..
[02:08:03] <wood_quinn> < wood_quinn> As long as the slackware/x{,ap} you have is for the version of Slackware you're running.
[02:08:47] <doug713705> sounds like shit has happened /o\

[02:10:48] <doug713705> that was expected

[02:11:32] <darwin> I had a multilib Slackware 14 system... I converted it back to pure 64-bit and tried to build some stuff that apparently cannot work on multilib, because some of it, or that package, is not implemented properly, but the package has some bugs that the maintainer does not have in his installation... what sort of things could be left around from a multilib system if I already deleted and rebuilt all the relevant packages?

[02:17:49] <doug713705> darwin: IMHO if you removed all -compat32 package, resinstalled the stock 14.0 64bits gcc and glibc package collection and rebuilt the third party libs needed by your app, things should work.
[02:19:34] <doug713705> But it sounds strange to me that an app can work on a 64bits system but not a multilib one, especially when this system is Slackware.

[04:04:24] <Skywise> nice
[04:04:42] <adioe3> oh, typo, 100 down Mbit
[04:05:06] <adioe3> funny fact is that the mtel costs ~25 euros whereas my current contract (16/1Mbit) costs >30eur
[04:05:20] <macavity> i just got 30/30mbit the other day
[04:05:27] <Skywise> yeah, they never lower the cost or improve the speed
[04:05:30] <macavity> adioe3: let me guess, fiber vs adsl?

[04:05:39] <adioe3> macavity, you guessed correctly
[04:05:58] <adioe3> a friend and me are the only ones in the building who want the fiber
[04:06:12] <adioe3> so we'll have to kiss the ISPs ass a bit to pull the cables into the building
[04:06:22] <macavity> same here.. adsl has coverage in the cities and is slow and and expensive.. fiber has coverage in the "rural" areas, and is cheap and fast as hell
[04:07:02] <adioe3> yeah, with 10 mbit up (or more) you can easily host a private server at home
[04:07:09] <adioe3> i could keep my git stuff at home
[04:07:17] <adioe3> + second use for the raspberry
[04:07:27] <macavity> and they are running a "no hookup fee" campain, so i took the bait
[04:08:07] <adioe3> i'm not from germany and my german is like my latin (dead); had a couple guys from T-Com trying to sell me 50Mbit contract for 50+ euros
[04:08:23] <adioe3> took quite some time to decypher that Geschwindigkeit is bandwidth :D
[04:08:26] <macavity> here they only offer symetrical.. 30, 60, and 90.. next year they will ditch the 90 for 100, and then offer 200 and 300 too

[04:13:09] <adioe3> offtopic, would an 800watt power supply bump my electricity bill more than a 600watt one or is that dependent on what's running on a machine?

[05:22:16] <adioe3> she had this odd thing about ornaments and decorations
[05:22:24] <BrokenCog> freekin wierd.  the only package which has a problem is tmux ... I'v tried a coulpe others and they all build just fine in /tmp ... tried rm -rf *tmux* in tmp and /var but still the same.  ah well.  ... chmod 777 tmux* didn't help either.
[05:22:29] <adioe3> she'd put small things, flowers and whatnot on every table in her vicinity
[05:22:52] <BrokenCog> I'm done for the day... laterz.
[05:22:54] <DarthEaron> can anyone help me get wine running in slackware 14 64 bit
[05:22:57] <adioe3> later
[05:22:59] <Urchlay> adioe3: that's not really a terrible character trait. Unless she does it to your desk too...
[05:23:13] <adioe3> she put shit on my desk while i was on vacation
[05:23:21] <adioe3> found a rainforest on my desk when i got back
[05:23:45] <adioe3> and my desk *always* has no more than 4 items (mouse, kbd, coffee and phone)
[05:23:50] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: the dead-simplest way to get wine running in slack14 64, go here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/files/Slackware%20Packages/1.5.21/x86_64/
[05:23:52] <adioe3> and that's the way i like it
[05:24:11] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: download the .txz file and use installpkg to install it. It should Just Work(tm).
[05:24:48] <Urchlay> adioe3: heh, I'm the guy who has to use a trackball because my desk is always covered in crap. Usually important or at least interesting crap though...
[05:26:14] <Skywise> its the neat desk thats a sign of a sicko
[05:26:25] <FLYSWATER> flys my master
[05:26:26] <Urchlay> usually tons of harcopy. I never ever print anything for myself, people would always hand me printouts, maybe with notes in ballpoint pen, and I never knew what to do with them (can't throw away, might need again, but no filing cabinet in the office...)
[05:26:30] <adioe3> Urchlay, i conditioned everyone in my office to send me stuff via email
[05:26:39] <adioe3> unless its something i must sign
[05:26:58] <adioe3> Urchlay, all you need is a big box
[05:27:02] <Urchlay> adioe3: the CEO was one of those guys who had his secretary read his email and print out the important stuff... I exaggerate, but not much
[05:27:44] <Urchlay> weird attitude for CEO of a tech company: he didn't want to ever learn or even touch anything technological.
[05:27:51] <adioe3> i am still trying to condition the project manager at my current job to not call me *just after* sending me an email
[05:27:56] <Urchlay> ugh
[05:28:15] <Skywise> i dunno, you think henry ford turned a wrench?
[05:28:32] <adioe3> he's one floor below and i can *literally* hear him when he talks on the phone
[05:28:38] <Urchlay> Skywise: I bet he did at some point in his career. And I bet he kept up with the technology

[05:30:29] <LSD`> Urchlay: doesn't sound too terrible a way to be for a tech company CEO, tbh.
[05:30:42] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: oh cool,so i know there is a slash command to make out conversation just between us, what is tht?
[05:30:42] <Urchlay> Skywise: Ford Motors also was a giant corporation with multiple levels of management, and *somewhere* in the management heirachy there had to be some technical types (or we wouldn't remember who hell hell henry ford was, in this century)
[05:31:02] <pink_mist> DarthEaron: don't do that. Urchlay might not want to take it in PM.
[05:31:02] <adioe3> DarthEaron, what IRC client are you using?
[05:31:11] <adioe3> *giggle*
[05:31:13] <pink_mist> DarthEaron: most clients work with /query though
[05:31:24] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: /msg... but don't use it. It's better if questions & answers are in the channel (in case I give you a wrong answer, everyone else will correct me!)

[05:32:39] <Urchlay> LSD`: he was a micromanagement type. This was a 10-person company to start with, and he would insist on making technical decisions... without listening to the experts he hired (he deliberately didn't know about tech, fine, he should hire people who do and listen to them, right?)
[05:33:09] <adioe3> Urchlay, nope, the CEO manifesto says to do the opposite of what the techies say, always
[05:33:14] <DarthEaron> lol thanks guys but it was not ment for now, just for future use...okay so when i try wine now in terminal i get the follinw output..

[05:33:34] <Urchlay> you're about to paste a bunch of crap in here, right?
[05:33:37] <LSD`> Urchlay: it would be a balancing act, for sure, but we can all cite examples of what happens when management gets too out of touch with the customer base
[05:33:55] <DarthEaron> bash: /usr/bin/wine: No such file or directory
[05:33:56] <adioe3> DarthEaron, paste here: http://pastebin.com/ and then paste us the link you get
[05:34:06] <Urchlay> oh, that's only one line, he's OK
[05:34:23] <Urchlay> I was thinking of typical wine output, with 30 lines of debugging info
[05:34:36] <adioe3> LSD`, that happens to very tech savvy people too, just look at gnome
[05:34:44] <DarthEaron> lol not dumb enough to do that, not that much a noob...well i probably am
[05:34:49] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: you downloaded wine-1.5.21-x86_64-1sg.txz, and said "installpkg wine-1.5.21-x86_64-1sg.txz"
[05:35:17] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: well, "new" doesn't mean "dumb", you didn't know about PMs so you might not know about that either. No offense.
[05:35:29] <DarthEaron> yes, i can do a screen shot into pastebin right?
[05:35:46] <adioe3> DarthEaron, nope, make a screenshot and upload it to an image service (i recommend imgur.com)
[05:35:49] <Urchlay> of a terminal (select all the text, copy, paste), yes
[05:35:58] <Urchlay> of anything graphical, no
[05:36:31] <DarthEaron> what do you mean PM's?
[05:36:38] <Urchlay> "private messages"

[05:40:08] <ejm> hey, I fscked my /etc/fstab up, and I need to chroot from a live cd to fix it.  how do I mount my linux partitions?

[05:40:50] <notklaatu> mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/hd && chroot=/mnt/hd
[05:40:56] <notklaatu> assuming sda1 is your linux partition
[05:41:02] <notklaatu> i do not know because i'm not in your computer.
[05:41:04] <ejm> k thank you so much.
[05:41:14] <DarthEaron> yes i did, and im about to give pastbin url if you wanna see, but it did normal install
[05:41:24] <ejm> I know the hdds, but I couldn't remember the right syntax
[05:41:28] <notklaatu> cool
[05:41:31] <Urchlay> ejm: if you don't have /etc/fstab, and if you have multiple partitions and can't remember which is which, you might have to mount each one and look at it to see WTF it is
[05:41:43] <ejm> yeah
[05:42:00] <DarthEaron> http://pastebin.com/c8eDpgH9
[05:42:28] <ejm> I'm trying to fix my arch install.  I didn't know a thing about systemd, and I couldn't get anything to mount other than my linux hdd.  So I couldn't mount my ntfs drives or usb
[05:42:41] <notklaatu> wait why do you need to chroot? can't you just mount the drive and edit fstab ?
[05:43:02] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: that looks normal. After that, if you type "wine someprogram.exe" (where someprogram.exe is a windows exe that actually exists), it gives you "no such file or directory"?
[05:43:26] <ejm> Yeah I guess that would work.  I wasn't sure how to go about this as I didn't want to reinstall over 2 lines messed up in /etc/fstab
[05:43:27] <adioe3> ejm, docs has that covered: http://docs.slackware.com/howtos:slackware_admin:how_to_chroot_from_media?s[]=chroot
[05:44:03] <adioe3> ejm, also relevant: http://docs.slackware.com/slackbook:working_with_filesystems?s[]=fstab
[05:44:26] <adioe3> ejm, although archwiki is the new gentoo-wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fstab
[05:44:32] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: http://pastebin.com/a9y8qUrd
[05:44:49] <ejm> I hope this worked.
[05:45:01] <adioe3> DarthEaron, do you have wine in /var/log/packages ?
[05:45:03] Haldrik (~haldrik@unaffiliated/haldrik) joined ##slackware.
[05:45:05] <notklaatu> think positive!  oh who am i kidding, just reboot and cross your fingers.
[05:45:07] <adioe3> it should be named wine-....
[05:45:26] <adioe3> notklaatu, computing is 10% smarts and 90% faith ;)
[05:45:30] <notklaatu> haha
[05:45:39] <ejm> nuts
[05:45:44] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: if you "ls -l /usr/bin/wine", what do you see? (should be 1 line of output, you can paste it in here)
[05:46:03] <DarthEaron> adioe3: i just ran ls on /var/log/packages/ and itlisted wine in there
[05:46:07] <notklaatu> ejm: what exactly is the symptom? you sure it's etc fstab that's borked ?
[05:46:29] <adioe3> DarthEaron, can you copy the output of "cat /var/log/packages/wine*" to a pastebin?
[05:46:53] <adioe3> DarthEaron, also paste here the output of "echo $PATH"
[05:46:58] <Urchlay> he already pastebin'ed the results of installpkg (which look fine)
[05:47:11] <ejm> well, I'm not sure
[05:47:12] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 7836 Jan  6 10:00 /usr/bin/wine*
[05:47:23] <Urchlay> ok, /usr/bin/wine exists, then
[05:48:04] <ejm> I wanted to automount my windows drives, and it worked the first time with my 1st drive, and I should have left the fstab alone.
[05:48:05] <Urchlay> so the "no such file or directory" from bash, is kind of an odd error
[05:48:12] <DarthEaron> give me a minuiet guys...i gatta start X server back up.
[05:48:15] DarthEaron (~zp@69-92-79-116.cpe.cableone.net) left irc: Quit: leaving
[05:48:16] <adioe3> DarthEaron, what does "echo $PATH" say ?
[05:48:21] <adioe3> offa he goes
[05:48:26] <notklaatu> ejm: what'd you add to automount the partition?
[05:48:31] <pink_mist> Urchlay: would happen with a 32bit bin with non-working multilib on x64
[05:49:02] <pink_mist> and since wine needs to be 32bit, that's quite likely the case
[05:49:12] <ejm> sorry /dev/sda2 /win1 ntfs-3g defaults 0 0
[05:49:33] <ejm> and then /dev/sdb2 /win2 ntfs-3g defaults 0 0
[05:49:37] <Urchlay> hrr, right, I was assuming that since the package is for x86_64, the /usr/bin/wine (which is just a preloader that loads the relevant bits of wine) would be 64-bit native. But it's not.
[05:50:04] <ejm> I should have said /dev/sda2 /media/win1 since that worked fine.  So, now arch won't reboot
[05:50:15] <Urchlay> so I was wrong: I thought recent wine 1.5.x didn't need multilib, but I thought wrong
[05:50:56] <notklaatu> ejm: comment that line out?
[05:51:12] <ejm> no I didn't.
[05:51:23] <ejm> Should it have a # before it?
[05:51:43] <Urchlay> ok, when he gets back I'll have to apologize
[05:51:47] <notklaatu> well if you're trying to boot and that line is breaking your boot process, yeah put a hash in front of it and see whathappens.
[05:52:04] <ejm> k will do that now
[05:52:30] <adioe3> ejm, i doubt a win mount would break your boot (unless maybe you borked up the partitions)
[05:52:51] <ejm> Can I just say thank you guys for helping me?  I've tried using the arch channels and....they're not usually as friendly.
[05:52:57] <ejm> and it worked!
[05:53:19] DarthEaron (~zp@69-92-79-116.cpe.cableone.net) joined ##slackware.
[05:53:22] <pink_mist> congrats :P now abandon arch completely and become a proper slacker like the rest of us :P
[05:53:24] <adioe3> ejm, try mounting by hand and see what happens
[05:53:34] <DarthEaron> you guys still here?
[05:53:51] <ejm> nuts
[05:53:52] <adioe3> DarthEaron, i think Urchlay has a solution for ya?
[05:54:14] <ejm> well I was able to reboot fine.  Maybe I didn't change the permissions right
[05:54:25] <adioe3> ejm, paste your fstab somewhere?
[05:54:39] <adioe3> also, output of fdisk -l
[05:54:49] <DarthEaron> adioe3: okay sounds good to me, oh for some reason i am banned from this channel when i run irssi as root but not as standard user
[05:55:01] <adioe3> DarthEaron, don't run irc as root, megabad idea
[05:55:08] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: I made a mistake. I was under the (mistaken) impression that newer 1.5.x wine for x86_64, didn't require a multilib system. I was wrong.
[05:55:09] <adioe3> (security considerations)
[05:55:14] <ejm> ka hang on a second.
[05:55:44] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: miltilib? ive heard of it from google but i never needed it on debian
[05:55:47] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: so you'll have to multilib-ify your system. http://slackware.com/~alien/multilib/
[05:56:00] <Urchlay> you maybe had it on debian already, without having to install anything

[05:56:28] <adioe3> DarthEaron, you need to install 32-bit libraries so you can run wine, bob wrote a lovely wiki page about it here: http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=slackware:multilib (he also maintains slackware's multilib packages)
[05:57:09] <adioe3> DarthEaron, basically you need to download those packages and install them but i'd recommend reading that page completely so you know what you're doign

[05:57:21] <ejm> ok pastebin.com/u/ezzep123#_=_

[05:58:11] <adioe3> ejm, this is output of a make command... i'm confused, didn't you have a problem with fstab?
[05:58:14] <ejm> oops
[05:58:18] <ejm> forgot to paste
[05:58:23] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: im sorry no, DarthEaron has always been myinternet pressence from age like 12 and im 19 now

[06:00:44] <ejm> I'm not sure
[06:01:02] <DarthEaron> he had all the kids in the band running linux (FREADKING AWESOME teacher)
[06:01:04] <Urchlay> linux 9.10?

[06:02:46] <DarthEaron> it was time, oh and why no irc as root?
[06:02:58] <adioe3> ejm, couldn't help but notice you have the same UUID for root and home
[06:03:01] <Urchlay> that worked for teaching myself to really touch-type, too. Got a keyboard with removable keycaps (separate from the actual keys), removed them all, used it for everything for a month

[06:04:46] <ejm> ok gotcha
[06:04:47] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: in general, programs that don't need root access to work, shouldn't be run as root. Especially ones that talk over the network. If there's a bug in the program that can be exploited by whatever's on the other end (the IRC server in this case, which bazillions of other people have access to), it could lead to horrible code being run on your system. If you're running as root, horrible code gets runs with root access.
[06:05:09] <Urchlay> (root = god, more or less. You already knew that much I think)
[06:05:27] <adioe3> i was taught that root = lotsa fun user
[06:06:03] <wood_quinn> There should be a channel ban on the darkstar hostname too.
[06:06:13] <pink_mist> wood_quinn: why? 0_o
[06:06:14] <Urchlay> heh
[06:06:20] <adioe3> wood_quinn, you enjoyed 1984, didn't you?
[06:06:20] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: i did, and also i knew that you should not but i saw an almost over reaction to running it as root so i was thinking there was a well known vulnerability on irc clients...Im Sec+ certified from CompTIA by the way
[06:06:34] <wood_quinn> pink_mist: Just a joke.
[06:06:40] <DarthEaron> wood_quinn: whats wrong with darstar?
[06:06:56] <adioe3> DarthEaron, that's slackware's default hostname :)
[06:07:00] <wood_quinn> Let's also do some port scans while we're at it.
[06:07:09] <adioe3> nmap is outlawed in my country
[06:07:19] <wood_quinn> Actually, each connection requires three hours of penetration testing.
[06:07:27] <wood_quinn> Great idea.
[06:07:38] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: ok, eh, on paper anyway, you know better than I do why it's a bad idea. When you get kicked, the kick message actually tells you to reconnect as another user, so it's not really a show-stopper for anyone.
[06:08:07] <Urchlay> adioe3: tell me you're joking

[06:08:25] <pink_mist> Urchlay: if someone else just joined as root and got kicked, all I'll see is that I'm banned without knowing why :P
[06:08:27] <ejm> ok ready?  pastebin.com/k2e8dsSx
[06:08:35] <wood_quinn> Chances are they're just as unfamiliar with IRC and they won't come back.
[06:08:37] <adioe3> Urchlay, nope, http://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html
[06:08:43] <Urchlay> pink_mist: ah, right, the ban lasts a while
[06:09:20] <ejm> has anyone installed steam on slackware? that's the only thing I would have in my way of installing slackware?
[06:09:32] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: yeah i know i should switch from running root, thing is i have no sensitive info on my computer, anything money related i use 3G connection to do on my phone... the only reason i have not switched from root is because im lazy and i dont feel like exporting and re-importing my VM
[06:09:35] <wood_quinn> Why would you want to install DRM on Slackware?
[06:09:45] <ejm> really, I wouldn't have my fstab mucked up if arch had an installer
[06:09:51] xev (~xev@unaffiliated/xev) joined ##slackware.
[06:09:58] <Urchlay> ejm: the only person I know who tried is KaMii (who seems to be asleep right now). Dunno if she actually got it working or not though.
[06:10:03] <adioe3> ejm, if you don't mind me asking, which of these is your root (i assume /dev/sdc2) and which is home (???) partition?
[06:10:07] <d4wnr4z0r> ejm: yes, easily done using alienbob's packages and instructions
[06:10:08] <ejm> k
[06:10:14] <adioe3> ejm, or they are not actually two partitions but one?
[06:10:21] <ejm> one of the partitions is swwap
[06:10:32] <pink_mist> ejm: I know there's a topic on linuxquestions.org under the slackware subforum about steam on slack
[06:10:33] <ejm> 2 partitions--one is swap and the other is /
[06:10:36] <pink_mist> you might want to check there
[06:10:43] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: you could just mv the VM image and config file to your non-root user's directory.
[06:11:02] <wood_quinn> Running the game on Linux probably violates the ToS anyway.
[06:11:08] <ejm> not anymore
[06:11:13] <ejm> they have a native steam installer
[06:11:26] <Urchlay> if the price of playing a game is that I have to use steam, I can do without that game
[06:11:31] <ejm> I'm not going to get into the whole DRM argument unless you really want to.
[06:11:41] <DarthEaron> Urchlay:...I need sleep. I knew that i did it about a year ago runing BT4
[06:11:44] <adioe3> ejm, try replacing your fstab with this: http://pastebin.com/rb4Dsac5
[06:11:46] <Urchlay> (that doesn't have anything do with with the OS I use, I wouldn't run it if I were using windows)
[06:11:50] <wood_quinn> ejm: Nah, we do that argument on Thursdays and Sundays.
[06:11:55] <ejm> lol!
[06:12:38] <wood_quinn> Steam is a great idea in general, but when you throw in the obligatory DRM I lose interest.
[06:12:41] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: I dunno what "BT4" is (my brain thinks BT = BitTorrent, obviously wrong)... but if you did it on one linux distro, you can do it on another.
[06:12:49] <adioe3> wood_quinn, sounds about right, being irritated on thursdays because its not fridays and on sundays because tomorrow is monday...
[06:12:51] <wood_quinn> Same way with stuff like Netflix and iTunes.
[06:13:20] <adioe3> steam is evil, 10 times more if you have a younger brother
[06:13:37] <ejm> yeah, netflix is a really dumb thing.  I mean, we use a roku that uses linux to use/watch netflix
[06:13:37] <Urchlay> never used netflix... itunes would annoy me even without DRM... it doesn't play nice with other apps (it moves & renames all your files, assuming you will never ever care to use any other player)
[06:13:41] <adioe3> i have about 40+ games on that thing i'll never play
[06:14:05] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: BackTrack4, and i just didn't think of it till you said something
[06:14:14] <ejm> itunes is evil on movies now..not so much on music anymore imo.  I refuse to buy movies unless it's on a dvd.
[06:14:18] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: I was just referring to managing your library of <stuff> somewhere offsite.
[06:14:28] <DarthEaron> anyone hear get netflix running on slackware?

[06:15:41] <Urchlay> ejm: yeah. Having the physical media is nice. Although when I buy DVDs, I use them once (to rip), put back in case, and watch the ripped copy. More convenient.
[06:16:06] <adioe3> Urchlay, doesn't everybody? if for nothing else, not to scratch the dvds
[06:16:22] <ejm> the last movie I bought off of itunes refused to play on my tv because it wasn't dhcp complient.  Thank you very much Intel.
[06:16:40] <ejm> I complained to itunes and they refunded me
[06:16:46] <ejm> I mean apple, not itunes
[06:16:56] <wood_quinn> TV? DHCP?
[06:17:09] <wood_quinn> Intel?
[06:17:14] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: adioe3: How often are you guys on this channel? im logging of soon but ill havesome time tommorow
[06:17:15] <wood_quinn> Lol :)
[06:17:18] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: get netflix running on slackware, using what? wine? maybe possible (or not). A VM? should be easy enough. Natively? doubtful. There *is* a silverlight for linux, but no idea if it actually works (or is actually complete)
[06:17:20] <ejm> my hdmi cable wasn't dhcp certified by itunes.
[06:17:25] <adioe3> DarthEaron, there's always somebody here
[06:17:50] <adioe3> lol, "certified by itunes", sounds like a nigerian scam
[06:17:58] <ejm> And that is why I will use AMD.  I don't care if an i5 can whip my A8-3870 in Adobe photoshop because I don't use photoshop.

[06:18:06] <DarthEaron> i could watch netflix on debian, but not on slack
[06:18:27] <adioe3> DarthEaron, do they have a linux client? i dunno, i'm in germany (= no netflix)
[06:18:33] <Skywise> thats a matter of skill level, not distro
[06:18:40] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: I'm here a good bit, so's wood_quinn and pink_mist. These other guys are less-frequent visitors (or maybe they just lurk more)
[06:18:44] <adioe3> ejm, i've *always* been using AMD and always been happy with it
[06:18:54] <ejm> and then warner bros. wonder why people choose TPB over the boxed set
[06:19:13] <ejm> I think the fusion series, if used for the purpose it was built for, is amazing.
[06:19:14] <adioe3> yesterday i noticed TPB has an "I'm feeling lucky" button :D
[06:19:24] <Urchlay> adioe3: I even liked my old amd "586" (which was a 486 @ 133MHz)
[06:19:28] <DarthEaron> adioe3: you could proxy your traffic and watch netflix that way
[06:19:55] <ejm> I'm amazed that AMD has kept going with how much it has to work with now.
[06:19:56] <adioe3> ejm, my FX-8150 is a lovely monster which i wouldn't change for anything
[06:19:57] <Urchlay> I mean, in 1995 or whatever year it was. Back when the pentium was new and expensive.
[06:20:32] <ejm> 2/3 the performance of an i7 for 1/2 the price? or something like that on tom's hardware
[06:20:37] <adioe3> in my history i had two intels: a Pentium MMX @ 200MHz (on which Windows ME worked perfectly which was very odd) and a core 2 duo on a laptop which is now fried.
[06:20:44] <wood_quinn> ejm: Heh.
[06:20:53] <wood_quinn> Try 2/3 the performance for 1/10 the price.
[06:20:59] <ejm> yeah
[06:21:07] <wood_quinn> Your average AMD CPU is about what, $300 nowadays?
[06:21:07] <adioe3> ejm, well, 8core @3.6GHz is about enough performance for me
[06:21:09] <DarthEaron> my first Desktop was in 2009 and it ran windows 98
[06:21:20] <wood_quinn> Intel's are in the thousand range.
[06:21:21] xev (~xev@unaffiliated/xev) left irc: Quit: leaving!
[06:21:36] <ejm> are we talking the i7 EE? Yeah, those are pricy.
[06:21:56] <adioe3> is the price bump because of the GPU on CPU or just the branding?
[06:21:58] <DarthEaron> what do you guys think of getting a macbook?
[06:21:58] <Urchlay> I used to jump back & forth between intel and AMD. Been strictly AMD since maybe 2001... except my netbook (intel atom). Not religious about it, anyway
[06:22:02] <wood_quinn> Not to mention at least AMD uses sensible naming schemes.
[06:22:18] <adioe3> DarthEaron, we use macs at work. they do the job although not very tinkerable
[06:22:23] xev (~xev@unaffiliated/xev) joined ##slackware.
[06:22:27] <wood_quinn> i7 = hexacore, no wait it's a type of core, no it's a hexacore, no wait...
[06:22:31] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: I'd be willing to get a macbook provided I wasn't the one paying for it :)
[06:22:34] <d4wnr4z0r> macbooks are good hardware. I would have to reload one if I bought one, personally.
[06:22:38] <ejm> funny
[06:22:38] <adioe3> afaik i7 = 4 core x 2 threads ?
[06:22:56] <adioe3> or are they now true 8-core ?
[06:22:59] <Urchlay> I can't even remember which are the crappy apple laptops, macbooks or ibooks
[06:23:12] <wood_quinn> adioe3: I have no clue, and that's my point heh.
[06:23:14] <d4wnr4z0r> Urchlay: *books
[06:23:16] <d4wnr4z0r> :)
[06:23:25] <ejm> you know what????? I'm goint to install slackware.  At least slackware keeps it simple with a damn installer!  Not having an installer IMO is going against the KISS philosophy!
[06:23:34] <Urchlay> I know one line of them was horrid (saw one once with a cracked motherboard, apparently just caused by the weight of the user's hands)

[06:24:48] <ejm> yessirree thank you slackware folks for showing me my error of going with a different linux.
[06:25:03] <Urchlay> know someone with a new-ish imac (maybe 2011), it looks like the backlight is multiple tubes, and one is dead (the bottom left corner of the screen looks like it's not backlit)
[06:25:07] <d4wnr4z0r> I tolerated osx for a bit, but I ended up running virtualbox with a slack VM on one screen and a BSD VM on the other screen and never using os x directly.
[06:25:14] <DarthEaron> okay, goodnight guys thank you all.

[06:26:22] <ejm> oh yes...I love how slackware has so much documentation
[06:26:38] <adioe3> that's very ironic because the docs used to be scattered around much :)
[06:26:42] <ejm> I just have to get the 6670 drivers installed right.
[06:26:51] <adioe3> ejm, nvidia?
[06:26:52] <d4wnr4z0r> slack has no oddities. it is a mirror; one looks in and sees one's own oddities looking back.
[06:26:52] <ejm> either that, or I just jump on ##slackware

[06:27:09] <adioe3> tho slack is the only distro that has useful README files ON THE FRIGGIN CD
[06:27:19] <ejm> YESSS!
[06:27:32] <Urchlay> they still are, unless docs.slackware.com is starting to include stuff from the various other places
[06:27:43] <adioe3> Urchlay, i think they're piling all the good stuff there
[06:27:47] <ejm> The installer.txt file on the arch disc is one that assumes you remember correct command syntax
[06:27:49] <Urchlay> nice
[06:28:13] <Urchlay> reminds me, I still gotta actually write the couple articles I've been bouncing around in my head
[06:28:14] <adioe3> i saw a lot of howtos up on there and lotsa people who wrote the original scattered docs gave permission to put their stuff up there too
[06:28:21] <d4wnr4z0r> arch heh
[06:28:24] <d4wnr4z0r> arch is funny
[06:28:36] <d4wnr4z0r> I think that may be its entire reason for existence; it makes one laugh.
[06:28:45] <adioe3> bleeding-edge becomes just bleeding when you have actual work to do.
[06:29:18] <Urchlay> d4wnr4z0r: I never used arch... does pacman use an ascii pac-man eating dots, as a progress bar? (that would make me laugh)
[06:29:53] <adioe3> i tried it once, took me whole 40 mins to fsck it up beyond recognition
[06:29:54] <d4wnr4z0r> Urchlay: no, but it really should
[06:29:57] <ejm> looks like apt-get
[06:30:12] <adioe3> never did understand the logic behind pacman's switches laso
[06:30:14] <adioe3> also*
[06:30:18] <ejm> it's like installing gentoo, but without messing with cflags and such
[06:30:24] <adioe3> what was the install one? pacman -S program ?
[06:30:25] <adioe3> or sth
[06:30:30] <d4wnr4z0r> pacman is not as bad apt-get. though it's dumb in other ways.

[06:31:12] <adioe3> systemd is evil (or so i've heard)
[06:31:37] <adioe3> what was the idea behind systemd, faster boot times?
[06:31:45] <d4wnr4z0r> about the only thing arch definitely does correctly is providing headers instead of stuffing them in separate -dev(el|) packages
[06:31:53] <ejm> no...more like scheduling stuff that I don't worry about
[06:32:15] <ejm> and then something about doing stuff that sysinitv couldn't do
[06:32:22] <d4wnr4z0r> systemd can provide faster boot times, and also managed a ton of other crap that has nothing to do with system init
[06:32:27] <ejm> yeah

[06:44:55] <d4wnr4z0r> the best way to deal with arch is to look at it a bit. you'll then find it's exceedingly silly and will have no choice but to laugh at it.
[06:45:06] <Urchlay> (at least, I was. Great show, but the ending sucked)
[06:45:31] <ejm> I'm in season 3 right now.  I want to watch the original series w/Loren Green after I finish it all.

[06:49:19] <DarthEaron> Thanks it works
[06:50:20] <ejm> is there an irc app you recommend that's free? using an ipod touch.  I'll pay if I have to, but would rather not.
[06:50:32] <Urchlay> ejm: I met a guy last week who looks exactly like Tigh in the new series. He'd never even heard of the show...
[06:50:38] <ejm> oh wow!
[06:51:09] <ejm> I was playing Fallout: New Vegas, and the doctor, who is a nice guy, sounded like Tigh.  Turns out it was him.

[06:51:56] <Urchlay> that's kinda like the old command & conquer game, where James Earl Jones plays the general of the good side in the cutscenes
[06:52:09] <Urchlay> "No, don't listen to him, he's Darth Frigging Vader!"
[06:52:38] <DarthEaron> Let your emotions flow through your uvula
[06:53:24] <Urchlay> his voice is scary to me, no matter what he's in. If I ever met him I'd probably run away.
[06:53:47] <DarthEaron> You mean James Earl Jones?
[06:53:50] <Urchlay> yeah
[06:54:06] <DarthEaron> Ha ha ha he played on an episode of house once
[06:55:37] <Urchlay> I never like meeting actors anyway. What I *really* want is to meet the characters (who are of course fictional, so the actors turn out to be kind of a lame substitute)
[06:56:17] <d4wnr4z0r> most people don't realize that's what they actually want.
[06:56:20] <ejm> So I bought a dsl modem/wireless router from Century Link.  It runs quite hot for a router.  What are the chances of me being able to open it up and stick a couple of small fans into it?

[06:59:07] <ejm> yeah
[06:59:22] <ejm> I haven't cracked the case open yet since I can't find the screws.
[06:59:41] <ejm> I have a Pentium III cpu fan here that I think would fit.

[07:00:26] <ejm> that's what I'm going to check tomorrow.
[07:00:29] <Urchlay> in extreme cases, I know a guy who has a light touch with a hacksaw :)
[07:00:34] <ejm> I'm pretty sure they're there.
[07:01:09] <ventYl> or it's like crappleware
[07:01:22] <ventYl> glued together like japanese girl after bukkake
[07:01:36] <Urchlay> he's been known to fix dead wallwarts by gently sawing them open and soldering a new cord to replace the old one (that invariably breaks inside the case, just before the "strain relief" grommet that never works)
[07:01:55] <ejm> lol
[07:02:08] <Urchlay> it used to be a more useful skill than it is now
[07:02:18] <ejm> I've been wanting to get a SSD for a while.  so freaking fast. so much freaking money..
[07:02:22] <DarthEaron> I'm actually logging off this time. By the way from now on if you were talking to me you have to put in my name That way my phone will go off.

[07:03:51] <Urchlay> ejm: you could use tmpfs. Faster, cheaper, and only missing one little feature (permanent storage!)
[07:04:06] <ejm> using my ram as a HDD?
[07:04:19] cmyster (~cmyster@94.159.255.145) joined ##slackware.
[07:04:25] <Urchlay> yeah. Not useful for your root partition, but very useful for /tmp
[07:04:51] <Urchlay> especially if you build lots of slackbuilds
[07:05:09] <ejm> yeah
[07:05:22] <ejm> considering I bouth 1866mhz ram, I should try it
[07:06:28] <Urchlay> I even thought about having /home/urchlay on my netbook be a tmpfs. Populate it from some other dir at boot time... but it'd be a pain in the ass to retrain myself to remember that new stuff in my home dir will disappear on reboot
[07:06:43] <ejm> yeah
[07:07:01] <ejm> using an hp mini110 myself right now.
[07:07:10] <ejm> slow as hell until I put linux on it
[07:07:43] <Urchlay> at this point though, /home/urchlay is the only place where disk writes happen during normal operation. Everything that logs, either has logging disabled, logs to /tmp/somewhere, or directly to a tty.
[07:07:51] <Urchlay> no crond or atd running
[07:07:56] <ejm> fast?
[07:09:16] <Urchlay> well, it's a dinky little atom, "fast" doesn't describe it... a bit faster than it would be, plus the hard drive can actually powersave (don't bother with powersaving on a stock slackware install, it'll keep waking up just seconds after it goes to sleep, and wear out the drive)
[07:09:45] <Urchlay> I mean, don't bother with hard disk powersaving
[07:10:13] <ejm> lol I put arch on my netbook....everything works great.
[07:10:35] <Urchlay> including letting the drive unpark the heads and/or spin down?
[07:10:40] <ejm> I've been wanting to put slackware on it instead, but everything is working, and it's not taking ages like MS7 or suse.
[07:11:08] <Urchlay> (have you actually watched "smartctl -a" output, see if it's logging excessive stop/start cycles? you won't notice until the drive dies, if you don't pay attention)
[07:11:24] <ejm> no, haven't tried.
[07:11:33] <ejm> the suspend/hibernate all work right.
[07:11:38] DarthEaron (~zp@69-92-79-116.cpe.cableone.net) joined ##slackware.
[07:11:46] <Urchlay> those work fine on my netbook, in slackware
[07:12:09] <ejm> but if I could figure how to get the screen to stop turning off when using vlc, it would be perfect.
[07:12:10] <Urchlay> (it's an asus eeepc 1000, from maybe 2009/2010)
[07:12:11] <ventYl> it mostly works nowadays
[07:12:34] <ventYl> even on archaic hardware
[07:12:42] <Urchlay> the only acpi feature it's missing that I'd like to have, would be hybrid suspend
[07:12:53] <ejm> yeah
[07:13:03] <ejm> I was lucky with mine.  everything pretty much works.
[07:13:18] <d4wnr4z0r> more like especially on archaic hardware
[07:13:26] <ejm> Have you checked out the chromebooks yet?
[07:13:31] <Urchlay> I think hybrid suspend didn't even exist yet, when this thing was new
[07:13:43] <d4wnr4z0r> probably with the chromebooks is that they run chrome os
[07:13:48] <d4wnr4z0r> s/probably/problem
[07:13:49] <ejm> yeah
[07:13:49] <Urchlay> eww
[07:13:56] <ejm> I'm not hip on that
[07:14:03] <ejm> They're sold out on newegg
[07:14:12] <shonudo> has anyone been able to hack one of those?
[07:14:19] <shonudo> cheap as hell; tempted to try
[07:14:22] <d4wnr4z0r> lots of people drinking the google-aid
[07:14:28] <ejm> I just wanted to get one because of the ARM arch.  and I want to replace the netbook with something a bit more gutsier.
[07:15:00] <ventYl> Urchlay: hybrid suspend? you mean that machine goes to sleep to ram bud memory is also saved to disk?
[07:15:00] <ejm> it sucks not being able to play anything beyond 360p or whatever on videos
[07:15:23] <ventYl> but*
[07:15:46] <Urchlay> ventYl: yeah. When I first heard of it, I assumed it was just a software thing (the OS did it), but apparently it's actually an ACPI call that has to be supported by the motherboard/BIOS (and mine isn't)
[07:16:06] <ventYl> i thought that it's SW only thing too
[07:17:17] <cmyster> its both iirc
[07:17:35] <ejm> can't wait to get my hands on an AMD a10-4600m.
[07:17:45] <Urchlay> ejm: if I ever upgrade my eyes, I'll probably start caring about high resolution video :)
[07:17:45] <Urchlay> ventYl: yeah. pm-utils' pm-is-supported tells me hybrid isn't available though
[07:17:57] <ejm> lol

[07:18:18] <ventYl> Urchlay: i never tried actually. for maybe one and half year i do not use suspend to disk at all
[07:18:27] <ejm> I game at a friends house, and he always spoils me with 1080p tv/monitors
[07:18:28] <cmyster> ejm, why?
[07:18:42] <Urchlay> right now I'm only using suspend to disk, because I pulled the battery out of the netbook
[07:18:48] <ejm> the IGPs are massive on the trinitys
[07:19:07] <cmyster> and...
[07:19:09] <ejm> mind you, they're not coding machines like a traditional pc
[07:19:16] <ejm> I just want to get one lol
[07:19:21] <Urchlay> (according to acpitool -B, it's lost 10% of its capacity since I bought it, and most of the time I'm using it while sitting right next to an outlet anyway)
[07:19:21] <cmyster> right :)
[07:20:04] <ventYl> Urchlay: iirc my laptop won't turn on without battery inserted
[07:20:11] <ejm> I was one the suckers who had a terrible budget build.  So I bought the 3ghz llano.  6 months later, Trinity started being released.
[07:20:17] <ventYl> at least last time when i tried it it refused to turn on
[07:20:53] <cmyster> ejm thats always true... wait another 6 months youll have a newer thing
[07:21:12] <ejm> Not really buyer's remorse, but one of the desktop trinity cpus runs at 65watts, instead of 100watts.  It shows on my power bill when I leave my machine on 24/7.
[07:21:53] <Urchlay> ventYl: I've heard of laptops like that, but never actually found one (every laptop I ever tried running without the battery would run fine)
[07:22:25] <Urchlay> how much do you pay per kilowatt-hour?
[07:23:20] <ejm> not sure...just know  that the power bill jumps $10 when leaving it on all the time.  I'll have to check it out
[07:23:24] <wood_quinn> Hooray for flat-rate rent.

[07:27:00] <Urchlay> ejm: that much, for only 35 watts extra?
[07:27:04] <ejm> yeah
[07:27:08] <Urchlay> damn
[07:27:10] <ejm> let me check though.
[07:27:48] <wood_quinn> I think my folks' monthly power bill was in the range of $200.
[07:28:18] <ventYl> Urchlay: maybe it was just some BIOS glicht because that was just after i've installed windows XP on it
[07:28:46] <wood_quinn> 'course they also live in the second largest wind-power-generating state in the US so.
[07:29:43] <ventYl> but another thing i observed was that after playing stalker several hours charger LED indicates that it's charging even if battery was fully charger just before. so maybe i have only weak charger, laptop knows it and refuses to start because under full load it can shut down itself ?
[07:29:55] <Urchlay> what I want is a power strip with an ammeter in it.
[07:30:17] <wood_quinn> ammeter?
[07:30:17] <cmyster> slack phone: http://blog.daum.net/jjiaejjang/101687
[07:30:34] <Urchlay> a thing that measure current, in amps (or more usefully, milliamps)

[07:31:31] <shonudo> that's a horrible looking phone...
[07:31:37] <shonudo> how do you take calls with it?
[07:31:41] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: The problem with something like that is that it uses power.
[07:31:52] <wood_quinn> shonudo: It's a smartphone, it's not designed to make calls.
[07:31:57] <shonudo> heh
[07:31:58] <Urchlay> 8¢ times 0.0035kwh times 24 hrs times 30 days should be $2.02
[07:32:00] <shonudo> how true
[07:32:36] <ejm> weird
[07:32:54] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: were did you get 8cents from....also how did you find the cent signon thekeyboard?
[07:33:26] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: he said $0.08 above. I have my right alt key set as a compose key, so I hit right-alt, c, /

[07:43:05] <wood_quinn> I prefer /notify if I care.
[07:43:18] <wood_quinn> DarthEaron: It's permanent until you turn it off.
[07:43:44] <wood_quinn> Typing /ignore will give you a list of things you're ignoring, and you can use /unignore <number> to remove lines.
[07:44:03] <Urchlay> always thought it'd be nice to have a smart version of that, that shows quits/parts for anyone you've addressed (by tab-completion or query) in the past 5 minutes or so

[07:46:25] <Urchlay> it's only annoying if someone's doing it constantly
[07:46:29] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Probably for the same reason as /msgs

[07:46:55] <Urchlay> I don't get too annoyed at those either. Though I generally respond with "in the channel, please"
[07:47:00] <j4son> people that have nothing more to give a crap about get pissed off at unsolicited /msg
[07:47:18] <wood_quinn> Says the expert on netiquitte.
[07:47:20] <j4son> there is a certain subculture that is even more perverse and care about a CTCP ping
[07:47:45] <wood_quinn> There are certain things that are well established conventions.
[07:48:16] <wood_quinn> You wouldn't call someone on the phone late a night or during the workday just to see if they were awake.
[07:48:19] <j4son> we get it, the 2 seconds it should take you to triage a IRC privmsg is too much to ask

[07:48:44] <j4son> spending it on IRC and all

[07:49:19] <Urchlay> yeah, I think maybe those who get annoyed, get annoyed because they allow their clients to beep or bounce the icon or something.
[07:49:27] <teamedward> unsolicited traffic is still traffic, i'm running a bouncer and even a ping maters if i'm mobile
[07:49:34] <wood_quinn> Spend time in IRC channels where people new to IRC frequent and you'll quickly get tired of the leeches constantly hilighting and /msging you because you are talking but not answering your question.

[07:49:48] <DarthEaron> wood_quinn: on the contrairy, i have called people many times for the sole perpose tosee if they were awake
[07:50:09] <wood_quinn> It's not like I have some dillusion that my time is valuable.

[08:01:49] <Urchlay> I ported uIP (tiny little TCP/IP stack designed for embedded controllers & such) and wrote an IRC client on top of that
[08:02:24] <DarthEaron> thats amazing, i once turned the toaster sideways to make grilled cheeses...
[08:02:38] <Urchlay> it uses SLIP, not PPP, and it doesn't include a dialer (so you pretty much need a linux box or something for the other end of the SLIP link)

[08:05:00] <Urchlay> well, I'm 40. I still think of 40-year-old women as old, trying to retrain my brain though
[08:05:19] <DarthEaron> ive been fooled a few times assuming people were guys, okay this is a test... is anyone watching this conversation a girl?
[08:05:35] <Urchlay> there are no girls on IRC, everyone knows that
[08:05:41] <Urchlay> except KaMii
[08:05:51] <wood_quinn> At least no girls without external genitals.
[08:06:00] <wood_quinn> Except KaMii
[08:06:26] <DarthEaron> on irc, all females are males, all kids are undercover FBI agents

[08:07:41] <DarthEaron> who is KaMii?
[08:08:13] <Urchlay> heh. I used to know a girl who entertained herself by pretending to be 13 on AOL chat (she was really 28 I think). She'd bait guys into hitting on her, private chat, get to where she was pretty sure they were actually fapping... and then tell them "BTW, I'm a 43 year old dude"

[08:17:18] <DarthEaron> i had to work on a womans laptop the other day who was using an OUT-DATED version of aol
[08:17:30] <Urchlay> free AOL floppies would do in a pinch for a slack install floppy set, but don't expect them to work a week later
[08:17:32] <ventYl> other were always unformatted and one had to place labels on it's own and these particular have been formatted and had labels already sticked
[08:18:13] <ventYl> I was curious why the sticker is so thick so i ripped it down and there was AoL driver floppy label underneath
[08:18:13] <Urchlay> ventYl: are you old (and poor) enough to remember buying single-sided 5 1/4" floppies and making them double-sided with a hole punch?
[08:18:22] <DarthEaron> i wanted to use her recovery partitaion and asked her what on her laptop she wanted to keep...i was asked if she would loose her emails
[08:18:22] <Urchlay> haha
[08:18:49] <teamedward> i remember write protecting my floppies with electrical tape
[08:19:16] <ventYl> Urchlay: they were 3,5" floppies. maybe they were formatted maybe not. but i remember clearly that labels were not sticked because everytime I sticked one it end up little bit misaligned :)

[08:20:06] <ventYl> disabling write PIN on EEPROM call cards?
[08:20:22] <Urchlay> being born in the 80s would mean you would have been old enough to want to make free payphone calls right about the time the tricks got harder/impossible to do
[08:20:32] <DarthEaron> i heard they fixed it in the mid 90's
[08:21:04] <Urchlay> no, he's probably talking about the low-tech "needle through the handset cord" hack, that actually used to work until they started encasing the cord in metal armor

[08:25:36] <ventYl> with linux on 486 laptop i was able to put around 2.8 - 3.2 MB on single floppy rootdisk with 1,68 MB format and zipped rootdisk
[08:26:39] <Urchlay> what was that, 1.44M but with extra tracks (or more sectors per track, or both)?
[08:26:43] <ventYl> after that 4MB RAM started to be problem so in turn i put swap on floppy until i was able to put enough libraries and binaries on rootdisk so i could reformat harddrive to ext2 and install system there
[08:26:45] <TommyC> !w Boston, MA
[08:26:47] <TommyC> wrong window

[08:27:42] <TommyC> heh
[08:27:49] <DarthEaron> how could you put more tracks on 1.44?
[08:28:05] <Urchlay> tell the stepper motor to step further in towards the center of the disk
[08:28:21] <Urchlay> some drives had mechanical stops to prevent the head from moving that far though
[08:28:25] <ventYl> i think that they were just more dense
[08:28:29] <Urchlay> nah
[08:28:45] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: how could you tell the stepper motar that?
[08:29:08] <Urchlay> at least, the extended-format floppies I'm familiar with (from the Atari ST) just used more of the disk surface (including the parts that weren't expected to be used, so theoretically failure could be more likely)
[08:29:51] <DarthEaron> goodnight guys
[08:29:54] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: in the old days, in DOS, you could directly talk to the hardware at the register level. These days, it would be done by the floppy driver in the kernel
[08:30:21] <ventYl> DarthEaron: different floppy formats were just different setups of stepper motor in floppy. afaik motor controller was software programmable or contained some non-standard step-count so there were formats like 1.54 1.68 1.72 and 2.88 MB floppy disks
[08:30:41] <Urchlay> my Atari ST floppy drive was one of the rare ones that had a mechanical stop, and couldn't go past track 80
[08:30:46] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: i ran dos a lot and i never knew this
[08:30:53] Sentient-Sod (~Sentient_@74.121.252.200) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[08:31:01] <ventYl> DOS required non-standard 3rd party driver or something like that
[08:31:16] <Urchlay> which sucked for me (pirated games tended to come as compressed files that would fit on an 83-track disk but not 80-track)
[08:31:43] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: if you weren't into hardware hacking and/or assembly programming, you didn't really need to know that I guess.

[08:31:54] <ventYl> Urchlay: i think that in DOS it was done by denser tracks because DOS wasn't able to find filesystem on 1.68 floppy even if it was formatted as FAT
[08:32:26] <Urchlay> denser tracks would be a lot more work (and would depend on the tolerances in the drive itself)
[08:32:36] <Urchlay> but maybe
[08:32:37] <DarthEaron> anyone know a channel to talk about trying to run a computer insdie a car
[08:32:46] <Crosma> I remember most BIOSs in the later DOS days had support for 2.88 floppy drives, but I never saw one.
[08:33:13] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: what, like a laptop in your car, maybe with a cig-lighter adaptor to charge it?

[08:33:45] <Urchlay> Crosma: I actually did see a couple of those drives (made by IBM, the eject button was blue and had a little '2.88M' logo on it).
[08:34:02] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: no like a desktop underneath the seat, ive seen it done safly amd reliably, just dont know how they powered it
[08:34:04] <Urchlay> pretty much nobody but IBM ever used them
[08:34:23] <ventYl> Urchlay: google says that it had 80 tracks and 21 sectors per track so it's definitely denser
[08:34:27] <Urchlay> well, one (kinda dumb/inefficient) way would be to use an inverter
[08:34:44] <Crosma> Yeah, I'm pretty sure all the larger sizes were just denser.
[08:35:09] <Urchlay> ventYl: oh, I thought you meant the tracks were closer together (so you'd fit 83 tracks into the same space as 80 tracks, but with the same # of sectors per track)
[08:35:33] <ventYl> Urchlay: that was what i means originally :)
[08:35:36] <ventYl> meant*
[08:35:41] <ventYl> i feel dumb after weekend
[08:35:52] <ventYl> maybe that vodka double shot caused it :S
[08:35:57] <ventYl> shots
[08:36:16] <Urchlay> more sectors/track (that kind of denser) was doable on PC hardware, but DOS didn't know how to use them as part of a filesystem
[08:37:33] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: we could talk about running a computer inside a car right here (it would be closer to on-topic than the current conversation about archaic floppy disk formats, especially if you plan to run slackware on your car-PC)
[08:38:34] <ventYl> it depends. if sector length was same only gaps between them were smaller than it should be able to read at least something from it. if sectors were shorter in order to fit three more per track then DOS had no change to read anything

[08:39:41] <Urchlay> yeah, that I dunno
[08:40:08] <Urchlay> floppies were originally FM, later MFM. Did anyone ever do a PC floppy controller that used RLL encoding?
[08:40:26] <Urchlay> (for hard drives, that would give you 50% extra capacity on the same media)
[08:40:47] <ventYl> maybe IBM 2.88?
[08:41:10] <ventYl> i don't think that their floppies were that much different
[08:41:31] <Urchlay> dunno. I know the media was different for 2.88 (you couldn't use a 1.44 just by poking an extra hole, would fail)
[08:42:28] <Urchlay> people used to call it "quad density" which implies twice as many tracks, but it might have just been a marketing term

[08:44:19] <ventYl> and last floppy drive i have is in ancient laptop which is slowly dying (?)
[08:44:42] <ventYl> Urchlay: that's DMF format. similar to 1.68MB floppy format
[08:46:09] <Urchlay> I've still got 4 or 5 of the 5¼" drives from the atari 800 and XL series
[08:46:11] <ventYl> i saw windows 95 without internet explorer on 14 floppies. windows 98 had also installation files on CD divided in way they could be put on 1.68MB floppies
[08:46:25] <ventYl> but it required 70+ floppies :)
[08:46:25] <Urchlay> at least 2 of them work perfectly (or did, last time I had them hooked up)
[08:47:05] <Urchlay> and the others at least sort-of work (one gets lots of read errors, another will read but not write)
[08:47:21] <Urchlay> but I no longer have any of the disks for them, so they gather dust :(

[09:02:21] <KaMii> so you can read 50 shades of grey on your 50 shades of grey monitor
[09:02:35] <Urchlay> why do you keep saying 50?
[09:02:52] <KaMii> Urchlay: have you not heard of 50 shades of grey?
[09:03:04] <Urchlay> apparently not. Band? TV show?
[09:03:04] <KaMii> its a book series
[09:03:21] <wood_quinn> A very masculine one.
[09:03:22] <KaMii> and not a very good book series... but somehow it turned viral

[09:03:54] <KaMii> i think the author has a crush on that fb guy, mark zuckabergerface
[09:04:11] <wood_quinn> Because nerds are hot.
[09:04:29] <KaMii> its about this immature boy that is a self made billionare by his 20's but he loves BDSM with lots of women
[09:04:49] <Crosma> Actually, 50 Shades of Grey was a Twilight fan fiction originally.
[09:04:49] <wood_quinn> Because whips are hot.
[09:04:50] <KaMii> then he falls in love with this cougar and she ties him up and beats him
[09:05:02] <wood_quinn> Because cougars are hot.
[09:05:08] <KaMii> idk im making this all up, except for the self made billionare 20 year old boy
[09:05:16] <KaMii> oh and yea its full of bdsm
[09:05:20] <wood_quinn> Because lies are hot.
[09:05:20] <KaMii> i didnt make that up
[09:05:38] <Urchlay> ok, wikipedia actually has the reason why it sucks: "The Fifty Shades trilogy was developed from a Twilight fan fiction ..."
[09:05:39] <Urchlay> twilight already sucks, and fan fiction sucks in general...
[09:05:39] <KaMii> idk, i read the cover, and some reviews, and LMFAO how that book ever made it.. idk

[09:09:00] <DarthEaron> hi KaMii!!
[09:09:04] <KaMii> they just try to be all creepy , but really they are just failiures at it
[09:09:28] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Tombstones try to be creepy?
[09:09:30] <KaMii> wood_quinn: well, none of them were fat, all had some kind of eating disorder and really needed to gain weight
[09:09:39] <Urchlay> then you got the 2 guys I knew who were trying to start a death metal band, and wanted to write lyrics in a graveyard... dumbasses spent the night at the civil war memorial (which has *no dead bodies in it*, just headstones)
[09:09:48] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Oh my bad, I'm thinking of emos.
[09:09:56] <KaMii> lmfao

[09:10:37] <KaMii> wood_quinn: yea, emo's... they are just all suicidals that wanna be goth, but shop at hot topic and dress like wannabe twilight characters saying they are vampires
[09:10:49] <ewong_> it's not a good idea to upgrade packages within X Windows, right?
[09:10:59] <wood_quinn> ewong_: Why not?

[09:11:28] <wood_quinn> There is a gender.
[09:11:38] <wood_quinn> It's called "male."
[09:11:56] <DarthEaron> lol doesnt make a difference, if its something pertainins to the interface i think it would just require a reboot
[09:11:56] <KaMii> but i dont see an issue, if you upgraded something that would change x, it wont really do anything until you restart x again
[09:11:57] <Urchlay> KaMii: eh? I don't think I quite would have phrased it that way. I might have said "gender is irrelevant" (imagine me with a Borg eyepiece saying that...)
[09:12:14] <wood_quinn> Gender is futile.
[09:12:24] <wood_quinn> "Now bend over."
[09:12:29] <KaMii> Urchlay: i often imagine you with some borg parts
[09:12:36] <KaMii> borg leg, borg arm
[09:12:39] <wood_quinn> Borg beard.
[09:12:40] <Crosma> Borg penis?
[09:12:41] <DarthEaron> borg?
[09:12:42] <KaMii> lol
[09:12:44] <KaMii> borg beard
[09:12:48] <KaMii> ftw
[09:12:56] <Urchlay> hm, I could probably make a borg fake-beard
[09:13:00] <KaMii> DarthEaron: cyborg
[09:13:12] <KaMii> Urchlay: do it, then show it off when the jehovas come back
[09:13:20] <DarthEaron> haha borg hat
[09:13:35] <KaMii> make it with fiber cables
[09:13:38] <ewong_> I do a |sh ./setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg| and I get an "ImportError: cannot import name md5"

[09:14:03] <teamedward> i wish we had more jehovas in this area for me to greet in my nonchalantly and inadequately tied bath robe
[09:14:08] <KaMii> whats a .egg file?
[09:14:26] <wood_quinn> You want to delete that.

[09:17:08] <KaMii> i thought they used leather straps to sharpen razors

[09:18:26] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: yes the bootloader i guess its funneir when your on run level 3 and irssi takes the entire screen
[09:18:48] <core_saint> lol
[09:18:48] <KaMii> teamedward: i doubt they had access to a mirror very often
[09:19:27] <teamedward> were they even able to refine coca to powder back then?
[09:19:39] <core_saint> DarthEaron, that is some weird sense of humor
[09:19:52] <DarthEaron> core_saint: what do you mean?
[09:20:13] <Urchlay> anyway if I were dressing as a civil war soldier, I'd be a desk jockey, one of those guys at headquarters who never gets shot at or has to go a day without all the modern conveniences (of 1863)

[09:24:34] <DarthEaron> **dorms
[09:24:41] <Urchlay> but if you're gonna microwave a disc, don't waste a slackware one. Use something you hate.
[09:24:57] <KaMii> like ubuntu, osx, or windows
[09:25:07] <Urchlay> (preferably a stamped DVD, not a burn, they don't look as cool after nuking)

[09:26:09] <DarthEaron> microtoasty
[09:26:22] <KaMii> i have sims 3 songs stuck in my head

[09:26:46] <DarthEaron> im playing Blink182 on tty1 right now

[09:27:29] <KaMii> Urchlay: with my cooking abilities you really think I would mess that up?
[09:27:57] <Urchlay> aren't you the one who tried to boil water, and burned it instead?
[09:27:58] <DarthEaron> KaMii: You cook well?
[09:28:06] <wood_quinn> Very well.
[09:28:14] <KaMii> Urchlay: lol... yea
[09:28:18] <teamedward> i only burn the pans when i go out for a smoke and lose my appetite
[09:28:22] <DarthEaron> wood_quinn: you can testify to her cooking?
[09:28:23] <wood_quinn> Her parents were going to pay for French chef school.

[09:32:01] <ewong_> found out my problem..  upgrading python and mercurial required an upgraded openssl lib
[09:32:02] <Urchlay> I'd kind of like a kindle running slackware
[09:32:06] <KaMii> my grandma has one, shes in love with it
[09:32:29] <KaMii> oh, we gots updates?
[09:32:30] <Urchlay> (no idea if that's even remotely possible to do, I just like the screen)
[09:32:31] <teamedward> no i wasn't able to do anything other than read the poorly formatted tech books i bought on a whim
[09:32:41] <DarthEaron> you should fix it yourself? cant you do the recovery thing?
[09:32:44] <wood_quinn> I would like a good looking book reader, as long as my book library was mine.
[09:32:51] <teamedward> broken == cracked
[09:33:09] <Urchlay> actually. Do they make it possible to just plug a kindle into a USB port and copy files over to it?
[09:33:15] <teamedward> yes
[09:33:16] <DarthEaron> ....its usually the power button and the volume down key
[09:33:17] <KaMii> teamedward: do you have all the sims addons?  or whaever they call them?
[09:33:27] <Urchlay> well then it wouldn't be completely useless as-is, I guess
[09:33:28] <teamedward> there is usb connectivity urchlay
[09:33:37] <KaMii> oh.. its just firefox

[09:35:04] <KaMii> is that too much to ask?
[09:35:11] <wood_quinn> 15?

[09:35:26] <wood_quinn> Fifteen.
[09:35:27] <wood_quinn> Got it.
[09:35:39] <teamedward> i already tried making it into a bootable drive to no avail
[09:35:41] <KaMii> Urchlay: bushy with what?
[09:35:43] <teamedward> :X
[09:35:52] <Urchlay> at least, I've sent him a couple emails in the past months, and not gotten any response at all (not even "I don't have time to look at this right now")
[09:36:00] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea, same here
[09:36:05] <wood_quinn> He's probably on vacation.

[09:36:13] <Urchlay> lucky bastard
[09:36:16] <teamedward> no kamii, no addons for the sims yet, i only just now got it
[09:36:20] <DarthEaron> i wonder if itspossible to do x11 forwarding over irc
[09:36:21] <wood_quinn> He's probably on two vacations.
[09:36:39] <KaMii> teamedward: oh, i got the all
[09:36:51] <KaMii> lots of bugs as usual... yay EA... fix yer shit!
[09:36:55] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: theoretically? sure, why not? In practice, I don't think any such software already exists (you'd have to design & code it)
[09:37:47] <Urchlay> would be more useful to do general purpose TCP forwarding (X11 forwarding is just a special case of that)
[09:37:47] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: sound interesting....okay im actually going to bed now, imma run poweroff rught after /quit so this time actually goodnight
[09:37:48] <KaMii> why would you want to forward x11 on irc?
[09:37:55] <ventYl> Urchlay: in fact. maybe there's tcpoverirc or something similar
[09:38:14] <Urchlay> actually yeah, maybe there is. I haven't checked, just sorta assumed there wasn't
[09:39:00] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Narwhals.
[09:39:22] <DarthEaron> hmmm....put a terminal up thereso that everyone can see what your doing....like vnc but unable to take control so you can type on terminal and everyone with on the channel can see what your doing in terminal
[09:39:27] <ventYl> i just want to make work accelerated driver
[09:39:37] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: for that, you could use screen
[09:39:55] <ventYl> DarthEaron: that's bullshit because X is bidi so if i can see i can also control
[09:39:58] <KaMii> meh, just use your webcam and skype
[09:40:12] <DarthEaron> Urchlay: i have used screen to keep a program alive that i have run via ssh but nothing other than that
[09:40:18] <Urchlay> DarthEaron: or actually, vnc itself. vnc has an option to allow view-only connections (ignores their mouse/keyboard)
[09:40:20] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Because webcams are hot.
[09:40:29] <KaMii> but who would really want to connect to other ppl's x session?
[09:40:39] <teamedward> which of the add-ons add the most actual gameplay kamii? idc about outfits and styles so much as interesting interactions
[09:40:44] <Urchlay> KaMii: well, to spy on them maybe?
[09:41:00] <DarthEaron> ill think on it but i really do need to go to bed now. goodnight guys
[09:41:03] <wood_quinn> KaMii: Because spies are hot.
[09:41:16] <DarthEaron> im hot
[09:41:19] <KaMii> teamedward: well i really like ambitions, pets, vacation

[09:42:26] <wood_quinn> Becase... meh.
[09:42:28] <KaMii> but i like them all really
[09:42:42] <KaMii> im trying to figure out that superstar one, but theres bugs in it
[09:42:55] <wood_quinn> Does Sims 3 require a network connection to play?
[09:43:04] <KaMii> and becoming famous is more of a PITA than anything else
[09:43:08] <Urchlay> can you do a mod for the sims that turns your sim people into meth addicts?
[09:43:12] <KaMii> wood_quinn: no, but they want you to
[09:43:16] <wood_quinn> Ah ok.
[09:43:27] <KaMii> Urchlay: uhhh, no but they have naked mods and penis mods
[09:43:28] <wood_quinn> How resource-intensive is it?
[09:43:43] <KaMii> wood_quinn: well it loves to eat up 3 gigs of ram
[09:43:54] <KaMii> its a huge hog
[09:44:05] <wood_quinn> Hmm. I might see if I can play it anyway.
[09:44:07] <Urchlay> actually the game sounds pretty boring to me
[09:44:08] <KaMii> they really suck at their programming
[09:44:25] <wood_quinn> The Sims needs a pussy mode.
[09:44:30] <KaMii> Urchlay: its more of an experience, less of a game
[09:44:31] <wood_quinn> Oh. Um that came out wrong.
[09:44:33] <wood_quinn> Super-easy mode.
[09:44:37] <KaMii> wood_quinn: they have that too
[09:44:38] <wood_quinn> LOL
[09:44:47] <KaMii> the have anatomical body meshes you can download

[09:45:02] <KaMii> well ea doesnt, but third party people do
[09:45:13] <wood_quinn> I remember Sims 2 sex.
[09:45:15] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[09:45:16] <KaMii> the sims really sucks if you dont use mods
[09:45:37] <wood_quinn> Your neighbors would come over, and while the guy was in your living room watching TV you could sleep with his wife.
[09:45:44] <wood_quinn> And it didn't even matter.
[09:46:00] <KaMii> the mods really help to clear up a lot of EA's bugs, but im pretty sure they are just crude workarounds, not sure yet if it helps contribute to more resource hogging, but i would think yes
[09:46:13] <teamedward> mm i'd like to see a different variety of wall modes, such as being able to fit a fish tank in there and all my perfect litle fishies swimming about
[09:46:15] <KaMii> wood_quinn: yea, that was a mod at work
[09:46:30] <KaMii> teamedward: well use the cheats
[09:46:37] <wood_quinn> Were there mods for Sims 2?
[09:46:38] <KaMii> enabletestingcheats true
[09:46:43] <KaMii> constrainfloorelevation true
[09:47:07] <KaMii> i hack the crap out of my sims, their houses, and their world
[09:47:30] <teamedward> they must get deja vu all the time
[09:47:37] <KaMii> but i spend more time building houses and enabling cheats than playing the game
[09:47:44] <wood_quinn> So would I.
[09:47:53] <wood_quinn> You can get some cool stuff.
[09:47:54] <Demon_Fox_> KaMii, We all do
[09:47:55] <KaMii> you can make some cool houses
[09:48:03] <Urchlay> does it have disasters, like the old simcity?
[09:48:12] <teamedward> personal disasters
[09:48:19] <KaMii> yea, just personl disasters
[09:48:19] <Urchlay> unleash a hurricane or godzilla on your simulated world?
[09:48:26] <wood_quinn> Your house can burn down.
[09:48:27] <KaMii> which is whats bugged in superstar
[09:48:39] <Urchlay> being eaten by godzilla is a personal disaster :)
[09:48:41] <wood_quinn> Or your Sim can have a hissy fit and refuse to eat lol.
[09:48:45] <KaMii> because the paparazi lie about you all the time and your constantly getting debuffs
[09:48:49] <wood_quinn> Or you can force it to piss itself.
[09:50:01] <Urchlay> sims are too dumb to get up and go to the bathroom without being told to?
[09:50:08] <teamedward> i've done that yep, not one of my proudest moments
[09:50:09] <KaMii> one of my sims is a self absorbed singer, shes a level 4 celebrity, and the paparazi keep spreading rumors about her, and everytime she loses a friend she gets a massive hit to social, it totally disappears
[09:50:10] <wood_quinn> You can turn off free will.
[09:50:13] <Urchlay> that's even dumber than the units in games like warcraft 2
[09:50:32] <KaMii> Urchlay: not anymore, the sims 3 free will is much smarter
[09:50:50] <KaMii> but its too smart, so you really should turn down their free will, because they will just ignore what you say
[09:51:00] <Urchlay> (RTS games, you'll have a group of 5 units, and one of them gets attacked... in the old games, his buddies will just stand there and do nothing)
[09:51:09] <wood_quinn> "Go to work? Fuck that. I'ma shit the couch."
[09:51:21] <KaMii> lol
[09:51:31] <KaMii> just build houses
[09:51:50] <KaMii> then give your sims millions of simoleons using cheaats
[09:52:01] <KaMii> then raise their skills using mods

[09:52:31] <KaMii> i had one sim... he sorta impregnated the entire town, lol
[09:52:32] <wood_quinn> I made a sim once and forced him to work out 24/7.
[09:52:38] <Urchlay> give them infinite health and ammo, and give their rocket launchers the same firing rate as the chaingun
[09:52:41] <wood_quinn> It was hilarious. He was so damn pissed.
[09:52:41] <Urchlay> oh, wrong game
[09:52:52] <wood_quinn> But buff as heck.
[09:52:57] <KaMii> haha
[09:53:05] <KaMii> mr steroids?
[09:53:26] <teamedward> shoulda  name him Lance Armstrong
[09:53:30] <KaMii> lmfao
[09:53:34] <Urchlay> after he's been on roids for a while, you uninstall the penis mod?
[09:53:39] <KaMii> did you watch his interview with oprah?
[09:53:40] <wood_quinn> Oh yeah saw that on the news earlier.
[09:53:49] <wood_quinn> Not the interview. The drug news.
[09:54:10] <teamedward> yeah, armstrong is a dick, he screwed over so many people to protect his wallet
[09:54:10] <KaMii> i didnt see the oprah interview, was wondering what he said, or if she was brave enough to call him out
[09:54:40] <KaMii> did he ever really have cancer?
[09:54:45] <KaMii> or was that a lie?
[09:55:21] <teamedward> i didn't watch the whole thing not sure if that came up
[09:55:24] <wood_quinn> We'll soon find out.
[09:55:32] <teamedward> but everything about the drugs and the coverup he affirmed were true
[09:55:33] <KaMii> all those people that bough livestrong bracelets hoping they would be worth money as a collecters item.. lol now its worthless
[09:56:05] <wood_quinn> Not to mention how many people he's let down.
[09:56:12] <wood_quinn> What a prick.
[09:56:37] <KaMii> wood_quinn: this is why i never idolize celebrities
[09:56:42] <KaMii> they are all full of shit
[09:57:00] <KaMii> actor are the worse, they lie for a living, they pretend to be someone else
[09:57:05] <KaMii> why would i look up to them?
[09:57:21] <wood_quinn> I admire people's accomplishments.
[09:57:33] <wood_quinn> In Armstrong's case, that's been a huge letdown.
[09:57:49] <KaMii> nike hates him
[09:58:11] <wood_quinn> Of course, we'll soon see a bunch of "Oh he'd just gotten through cancer! Of course he *had* to use steroids. It was fair!" crap.
[09:58:32] <KaMii> i dont think so
[09:58:38] <KaMii> no one will say that
[09:58:48] <teamedward> already cropping up along with "he had to cause everyone else was too!"
[09:59:05] <KaMii> sports is fake anyway
[09:59:11] <wood_quinn> Yeah those bikers and their roids.

[10:00:05] <wood_quinn> Genitals just cause water friction.

[10:00:33] <teamedward> lol
[10:00:38] <KaMii> so you want eunic male hairless men?

[10:01:40] <KaMii> how can men be in sports if they dont have balls?
[10:01:50] <wood_quinn> The same way women can.
[10:01:50] <KaMii> most sports men watch involve balls
[10:01:56] <KaMii> lol
[10:02:05] <wood_quinn> The balls just have to be soft and big.

[11:23:57] <jelly> wood_quinn: jacklk has been a bit of a nuisance in #debian already and stated he actually had a slackware, not a debian question, so I redirected him here
[11:24:48] <adaptr> a nuisance in debian ? that takes some doing - what did he do ? proclaim the Policy is dumb ?
[11:24:58] <adaptr> (it is, btw)
[11:25:09] <core_saint> jelly, how would you compare slackware and debian?
[11:25:25] <jelly> core_saint: I wouldn't.
[11:25:37] <wood_quinn> Slackware is Slackware and Debian is
[11:25:40] <core_saint> lol
[11:25:50] <wood_quinn> (making sure my spelling was all good)
[11:25:53] <wood_quinn> Debian.
[11:25:59] <core_saint> i meant i guess you use them both... what are you using them for?
[11:26:15] <jelly> core_saint: I don't use Slackware at all.

[11:30:52] <core_saint> i can't believe that people still use vim
[11:31:26] <Master-Passeli> core_saint: why?
[11:31:39] <core_saint> it just seems so clunky
[11:31:40] <wood_quinn> Because emacs is so much cooler.
[11:31:55] <jacklk> nano beats them both
[11:31:59] <core_saint> and emacs does seem so much easier to use
[11:32:08] <jacklk> wood_quinn: Why were you asking? :)
[11:32:09] <wood_quinn> emacs has IRC.
[11:32:13] <wood_quinn> And web browsing.

[16:45:28] <Zordrak> plus, on a very low security system, you can set sudo up with NOPASSWD so that you dont need a password at all to swap to root

[18:51:27] <DarthEaron> so im getting a solid state drive today... i have / and /home on differenct partitions, can i move / to the ssd so i dont have to reinstall and keep /home on the sdd?
[18:51:41] <DarthEaron> **keep /home on the reagular harddrive?
[18:52:38] <mmlj4> with unix you can do just about whatever you like with your drives and partitions
[18:53:22] <mmlj4> but that SSD is going to be way faster than your spinning drive... you might take that into account
[18:53:44] macavity (~macavity@37.75.172.53) joined ##slackware.
[18:53:50] <DarthEaron> that was the point, to boot fater, but how to i move /
[18:54:06] <mmlj4> which brand of SSD did you get?
[18:54:18] <DarthEaron> intel
[18:54:21] <mmlj4> good
[18:54:25] <thumbs> ah, you overpaid
[18:54:52] <DarthEaron> well it 60 bucks for a 32gb ssd that was 3GB/s throughput
[18:56:05] <DarthEaron> Also i F**king hate listening to my drive spin... one of those things that bugs the crap out of me
[18:56:28] <thumbs> oh, that's a small one
[18:57:07] <mmlj4> you can try copying the various directories in / that you want on the new drive by using cp -a
[18:57:14] <DarthEaron> ist sole purpose was to store bootup stuff and other thigns i use often, everything else i can put in /home on the other drive
[18:57:25] <mmlj4> leave /boot on the old drive, probably
[18:57:33] <mmlj4> then edit fstab
[18:57:35] <DarthEaron> what about the MBR?
[18:57:47] <mmlj4> you can leave that too
[18:58:08] <DarthEaron> so the mbr would be on the hdd and point to / on the ssd?
[18:58:14] <mmlj4> you want /usr for instance on the SSD? then put it on the SSD
[18:58:23] <mmlj4> why bother moving the MBR?
[18:58:44] <mmlj4> leave MBR and / on the old drive
[18:59:19] <DarthEaron> lol imma just use my 1tb external for backing up stuff, then just reformat everything

[22:15:04] <smed> I recall the company I worked at taking delivery on an SGI Irix workstation about that same time frame....
[22:15:17] <Urchlay> remember what the price tag was?
[22:15:19] <smed> it came with a flight simulator installed and a beautiful 19" monitor at the time
[22:15:31] <smed> the engineers got nothing done that week.
[22:15:37] <unix> now unix based openbsd its hackerproff :))
[22:15:40] <Urchlay> yeah, I used to use one of those monitors (on a regular PC running linux), they were pretty sweet
[22:15:44] <smed> dunno - I worked for a memory MFR, SGI prolly sent it for free.
[22:16:00] <smed> or one of the distributors....
[22:16:08] <Urchlay> what was it, an Indy?
[22:16:15] <smed> the engineers had to reverse-engineer the memory modules that came with it.
[22:16:24] <Urchlay> wonder if my old indy still boots
[22:16:42] <smed> I think it was an indy, but to be honest - it was 20 years ago
[22:16:56] <smed> and I killed all of those brains cells
[22:17:00] <Urchlay> what, they gave you a free workstation, said "make memory for this", and didn't give you any specs?
[22:17:18] <smed> I wasn't an engineer - I was a documents control clerk ;)
[22:17:40] <smed> I'm still not an engineer, but at least I'm not copying autoCAD drawings anymore.
[22:18:32] <smed> stil, the flight simulator that ran on it was sweet.
[22:18:39] <Urchlay> I believe it
[22:18:54] <smed> I wonder if it was microsoft's FS......but how would that run on IRIX?
[22:19:16] <smed> I recall the engineers playing with it for a very long time....they got in trouble with their boss
[22:19:23] <eviljames> hotmail ran on freebsd for years... so why not?
[22:19:25] <Urchlay> MS could have ported it. They ported IE 4 and 5 to Solaris (I actually got it to run on a sparcstation 10)

[22:19:57] <Urchlay> IE on solaris was pretty painful to actually use, it was more one of those "I did it to see if I could" things for me
[22:19:58] <smed> Unfortunately, I dont know the details, but I recall looking over their shoulders for quite some time and it looked just like MS FS.
[22:20:26] <smed> I think the take-away piece from this story is that the graphics were like nothing I'd every seen before.
[22:20:41] <smed> and this is a time when everyone was running MS Windows for Workgroups v3.1
[22:20:41] <Urchlay> yeah, SGI was ahead of the curve, in graphics
[22:20:51] <Urchlay> not so much in OS design and security :)
[22:21:07] <smed> going back to my desktop after watching that SGI made it feel like playing with ColorForms(tm)

[22:25:40] <DarthEaron> Awesome wine is running
[22:25:44] <JarJar> hi, im in bit of a jam… for some reason my default keyboard layout has changed, and i have to reset after every boot.
[22:26:32] <JarJar> i think this could have something to do with the rc.keymap not being run, but at this moment i cant confirm the latter
[22:27:11] <Urchlay> if that's all, try "chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.keymap"
[22:29:47] <DarthEaron> ls
[22:29:52] <JarJar> i've just checked the rc.keymap already has the proper acces rights

[22:31:18] <Urchlay> (now why don't I have rc.keymap?)
[22:31:41] <JarJar> wel it's loading the be-latin1 map, and the map is located in /usr/kbd/keymaps i think...
[22:32:03] <JarJar> maybe your happy with the us keyboard layout
[22:32:21] <JarJar> appearantly its first initiated on changing the layout
[22:32:34] <Urchlay> I am (I'm in the US), but I thought the rc script should still exist (maybe without +x). Apparently not.
[22:32:51] <JarJar> but it worked fine for months, and suddenly im stuck with us on an azerty keyboard :)

[23:09:09] <Urchlay> he wants to run netflix
[23:09:13] <DarthEaron> it will work for a few seconds then it will crash
[23:09:22] <KaMii> wine cant do netflix
[23:09:31] <Urchlay> wonder why not
[23:09:37] <KaMii> silverlight
[23:09:50] <KaMii> you need .net4.0

[23:10:14] <DarthEaron> well that was alot of work for nothing...sad times
[23:10:24] <KaMii> if you want netflix, use qemu/kvm or virtualbox and a full install of windows

[23:13:48] <DarthEaron> really? so will windows 7 run smoother in this?

[23:14:08] <KaMii> Urchlay: why are you playing AoE on qemu-kvm when it works just fine in wine?
[23:14:17] <Urchlay> because it doesn't work just fine in wine
[23:14:31] <KaMii> works for me
[23:14:56] <Urchlay> or anyway it didn't, last time I tried it a couple years ago. Maybe it would work OK with a newer wine, but why do I want to change how I run it, when it's working perfectly?
[23:15:20] <Urchlay> and for anyone paying attention to my ramblings... fsv doesn't run on 32-bit either

[23:16:30] <KaMii> i cant remember when I did... because i did it a long time ago and stopped playing the game and deleted it, but it worked
[23:16:32] <Urchlay> KaMii: eh, I don't really care. I got it running fine on qemu years ago, after spending a couple frustrating weeks trying various wine hacks. Not interested in spending more time trying to tweak wine to run it, when it already runs fine.
[23:16:34] <JarJar> Urchlay, what errors do you get
[23:16:39] <JarJar> or whats the issue ?

[23:41:36] <theborger> what is everyone using for a wifi router now days?
[23:41:59] <NyteOwl> a 6AL^ and a coat hanger :p
[23:42:07] <NyteOwl> er 6AL6
[23:42:44] <KaMii> my motorola cable modem surfboard.. but im about to put wifi on my linksys
[23:42:54] <Urchlay> KaMii: well, it shows your actual filesystem, and you can navigate around and get the permissions/size/timestamp/etc of files. I'd call it a toy (I can get the same info much faster in bash, or even the file manager for KDE or XFCE)
[23:43:12] <theborger> NyteOwl: what is that? i can't find it
[23:43:15] <Urchlay> ...it still segfaults, but not until you exit it.
[23:43:22] <KaMii> Urchlay: ooooh, so its the pre-curser to KDE's Dolphin
[23:43:27] <NyteOwl> theborger: LOL a 6AL6 is a vacuum tube :p
[23:43:33] <Urchlay> well, maybe
[23:43:55] <theborger> NyteOwl: that is what i was like WTF lol
[23:43:58] <NyteOwl> theborger: just being snarky, sorry :)

[23:46:09] <JarJar> they've implemented the vdsl connection in such a way it only works with their branded sagem routers
[23:46:53] <JarJar> althought i have heard rumours about a fritzbox working on the vdsl line of my isp
[23:47:36] <KaMii> hahah i want this feature of HollywoodOS in linux:  The proprietary FitYouBastard(TM) compression codec
[23:47:59] <KaMii> 3 weeks worth of full screen, high definition video with NICAM digital surround sound can easily fit onto a single floppy disk.

[23:51:54] <Urchlay> don't expect accuracy
[23:51:57] <KaMii> can we sue for false advertising?
[23:52:06] <Urchlay> anyone can sue anyone for anything
[23:52:09] <KaMii> i bet it wont work with the alien technology
[23:52:11] <Urchlay> doubt you'd win

[23:52:42] <Urchlay> alien motherships all use Mac OS X
[23:52:43] <KaMii> it was lmfao funny
[23:53:07] <KaMii> Urchlay: you should download the rifftrax commentary and re-watch it
[23:53:12] <Urchlay> might, sometime

[23:53:37] <Fay> hey all
[23:53:41] <KaMii> alien is my favorite movie, and when i say they did a rifftrax for it, I had to get it
[23:53:48] <Fay> hey KaMii!
[23:54:01] <KaMii> JarJar: no rifftrax are audio commentaries by the guy that did mystery science theater
[23:54:05] <KaMii> hi Fay
[23:54:13] <JarJar> so that means getting the dvd out of the box
[23:54:16] <JarJar> to much work :D

[23:55:12] _`_ (~kittysnif@unaffiliated/happy) joined ##slackware.
[23:55:17] <KaMii> JarJar: the reason mystery science theater is no more on tv is beacuse he was losing money trying to get the rights to show old b grade movies that no one ever watched... hollywood was being dicks, as usual, so he stopped mstk3000 and started doing audio commentary, and told people to just buy his commentary for a few bucks and rent the movie
[23:55:34] <KaMii> JarJar: or you can just torrent them....
[23:55:41] <KaMii> its a b grade movie, like anyone will care
[23:55:52] <KaMii> well alien isnt a b grade movie, but... you get the idea
