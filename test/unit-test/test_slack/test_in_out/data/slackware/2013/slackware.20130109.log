[00:00:01] <icarus> anyone savvy with taking iphone mount images?
[00:00:10] <icarus> i have one mounted using ifuse under a directory
[00:00:18] <icarus> but its not mounted in /dev
[00:00:20] wharfrat (~wharfrat@unaffiliated/dedhed) left irc: Ping timeout: 240 seconds
[00:00:24] <icarus> so fdisk -l shows nothing
[00:01:01] <eviljames> that's bad.
[00:01:08] <eviljames> oh, iphone - nvm.
[00:01:11] <icarus> yeah
[00:01:24] <icarus> ifuse is basically like a fuse module using a libiphone lib to mount it
[00:01:25] <eviljames> iphone uses some crazy crypto over usb, so it likely won't show up in /dev
[00:01:37] <icarus> df -h shows it though
[00:01:46] <wood_quinn> What's the problem then?
[00:01:49] <icarus> shows all 16 gigs as thought it were in dev, which is strange to me

[00:02:45] <icarus> ive tried taking an image with dd, but i i cant find any valid mount points
[00:02:56] <icarus> /mnt/iphone/ is a directory, so it just gives me an error
[00:03:05] <eviljames> AFAIK you can't.
[00:03:18] <wood_quinn> If you could, you wouldn't use a mount point.
[00:03:22] <wood_quinn> You'd use the device node.
[00:03:25] <eviljames> Then again, I don't use iDevices, so I could be talking out of my ass.
[00:03:26] <icarus> hmmm
[00:03:28] <wood_quinn> Nerd? Node.
[00:03:28] <eviljames> icarus: rsync
[00:03:40] <icarus> eviljames: yeah, that would sync whats in the directory
[00:03:49] <icarus> but im looking to take a full on image of the 16 gig mount
[00:03:59] <icarus> ifuse works like fuse, so it has the "-o mount options"
[00:04:06] <wood_quinn> Doesn't iExtort have a backup function?
[00:04:12] <eviljames> Unlikely to happen.  Maybe with some libiphone hackery you could get block-level, but it's still going tobe painful.
[00:04:16] kermit (unknown@pdpc/supporter/bronze/kermit) joined ##slackware.

[00:04:33] <icarus> fuse allows for things to be mounted into dev as far as i know?
[00:04:43] <wood_quinn> icarus: No...
[00:04:48] <wood_quinn> You don't mount anything in /dev

[00:05:08] <wood_quinn> eviljames: Aptly named, for it's solidness.

[00:06:12] <wood_quinn> Forensics on a SSD :(
[00:06:21] <icarus> wood_quinn: yeah, ive got that down, im just confused because it shows up as a block device with "df -h"
[00:06:25] <wood_quinn> Doesn't sound like something I'd want to do.
[00:06:33] <icarus> which is probably like someone said, libiphone hackery
[00:07:04] <Urchlay> you can't just use dd to dump the contents of the ssd into a file, and do your attempted forensics on that?
[00:07:04] <wood_quinn> When you FUSE mount something, IIRC, df will show it as a block device.
[00:07:24] <eviljames> Urchlay: No, it doesn't present a block device to the OS
[00:07:26] <Urchlay> oh, an iphone
[00:07:30] <Urchlay> right
[00:07:35] <icarus> Urchlay: im trying to do that, but i cant get dd too recognize a /dev device
[00:07:42] <eviljames> IIRC it's some kind of crypto-usb-bullshit
[00:07:43] <icarus> a valid dev device*
[00:07:44] <Urchlay> yeah, not likely to work
[00:07:55] <icarus> i have it mounted though, i can browse the directories, etc
[00:08:13] <icarus> the imaging is key though, and rsync wont do it, has to be a full disk image
[00:08:14] <wood_quinn> So you've tried what df shows as the if= ?
[00:08:28] <Urchlay> right, but your box is talking to it at a much higher level than raw block access I bet
[00:08:30] <icarus> wood_quinn: all it shows for if is if=ifuse
[00:08:35] <icarus> wood_quinn: but curious, let me try
[00:08:37] <wood_quinn> Ok.
[00:08:42] <Urchlay> I suppose it works like gphotofs or mtpfs
[00:08:50] <eviljames> icarus: That really shouldn't work.
[00:08:53] <wood_quinn> Nah.
[00:08:57] <eviljames> Urchlay: Yeah, very much like that.
[00:09:09] <eviljames> Except even crazier, and Apple.
[00:09:29] <Urchlay> hopefully it works better than mtpfs, I haven't had wonderful results with it
[00:09:29] <icarus> ifuse, no such file or directory
[00:09:54] <eviljames> Urchlay: afaik, nobody has.  I've never had it work properly yet.

[00:12:59] <Urchlay> for this player, the mtp and block dev modes don't access the same storage. I had to copy all the files using mtpfs, switch the device to blockdev, format it (using the device's built in util, not linux mkfs), then copy everything back to it

[00:19:59] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[00:20:04] <wood_quinn> KDE knows best.

[00:20:47] <slurry> Ahh..
[00:20:47] <wood_quinn> I can't afford to use all of it for KDE's AI.
[00:21:05] <Urchlay> that kind of behaviour ("the desktop controls the whole system") is what keeps me running old-style window managers like windowmaker

[00:21:58] <Urchlay> the lest it could do would be to save the original brightness on startup and restore it on exit

[00:22:33] <Urchlay> right, and I want dumber
[00:22:33] <wood_quinn> It has compositing and applets!
[00:22:46] <Urchlay> windowmaker has applets (they're called dockapps)
[00:22:54] <Urchlay> and I have no use for compositing
[00:22:58] <wood_quinn> You can stop and start your mail server with KDE by clicking desktop icons!
[00:23:05] <wood_quinn> And assorted reasons.
[00:23:33] <Urchlay> (what would I do with it, get a headache trying to read the text in one semi-transparent window while the text in the window under it is visible? no thanks)

[00:25:51] <Skywise> wow, ff18 is out
[00:26:06] <Urchlay> the old aterm fake-transparency was better. All you could see through the terminal was the wallpaper, not the window underneath it.
[00:26:11] <Skywise> i'm not sure if i'm gonna get it or wait a few minutes for ff19
[00:26:22] <Urchlay> (of course if you use a cluttered looking wallpaper it's just as bad)
[00:26:33] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: That was actually a pretty neat looking feature.
[00:26:45] <wood_quinn> Skywise: Might as well get it now.
[00:26:52] <wood_quinn> You can't upgrade from 17 to 19.
[00:27:08] <Urchlay> why the version number inflation anyway?
[00:27:11] <icarus> things i have determined, just for frame of reference:
[00:27:19] <wood_quinn> 'cuz Chrome does it.
[00:27:27] <icarus> i can take an image of the iphone, but i must jailbreak it, then ssh in and dd over sftp
[00:27:28] <wood_quinn> Same reason for the 4 -> 7 move.
[00:27:33] <wood_quinn> Except less sane.
[00:27:36] <Urchlay> oh, this is the same silly crap as 15 years ago?
[00:27:37] <icarus> this ifuse technique wont do it
[00:27:42] <wood_quinn> 's/less/not/'
[00:27:42] <Skywise> keepin up with the chromeses
[00:27:44] <icarus> just wnated to let you guys know for future reference
[00:28:06] <Sandman1> icarus, lol
[00:28:25] <Urchlay> icarus: the act of jailbreaking and installing sshd or whatever you have to do to it, will probably wipe some of the data you're trying to recover from deleted files... ugh
[00:28:57] <TommyC> I must ask, since I don't have an iPhone, what exactly is jailbreaking?
[00:28:59] <Urchlay> a safe solution probably involves time travel. But if you could do that, you would have done it already
[00:29:04] <wood_quinn> TommyC: Rooting.
[00:29:04] <TommyC> And why is it beneficial for a regular non-techy user?
[00:29:08] <Urchlay> TommyC: basically, getting root on the device
[00:29:11] <TommyC> That's it?
[00:29:14] <TommyC> ._.
[00:29:32] <Urchlay> lets you install stuff from places other than the approved app-store stuff, for one thing
[00:29:38] <wood_quinn> You can get free apps, as well as access to a completely different app store.
[00:29:40] <Sandman1> So you can install unsigned applications is a jailbreak
[00:29:46] <Urchlay> (or so I'm told. I don't own an iphone nor want one)
[00:29:51] <Sandman1> its a pain in the ass to have to do and you should just get an android or something that you can "use"
[00:30:05] <wood_quinn> Also, in the past Apple has included hardware that wasn't accessible in the software.
[00:30:15] <TommyC> oh okay
[00:30:15] <wood_quinn> Past jailbreaks have enabled said access.
[00:30:48] <icarus> TommyC: allowing root access, basically
[00:30:55] <TommyC> Yeah I got that.
[00:31:04] <wood_quinn> I can be fun.
[00:31:06] <wood_quinn> It
[00:31:11] <wood_quinn> I, too, but I mean it.
[00:31:14] <Urchlay> heh
[00:31:26] <wood_quinn> You can run a little web server and junk.
[00:31:28] <TommyC> what about Androids?
[00:31:30] <wood_quinn> Torrent client, etc.
[00:31:30] <Sandman1> yeah I can on my android
[00:31:32] <Sandman1> without root

[00:32:28] <Urchlay> err, not apple, google
[00:32:39] <wood_quinn> Apple would sue Google.

[02:29:49] <gnisho> Maybe.  If you're converting from ext3 to ext4 on-line compared to copying to a new filesystem you'll get somewhat differing results.  There  are probably other similar scenarios..
[02:30:38] <wood_quinn> It's probably a non-issue, just curious.

[04:23:06] <wood_quinn> nofra: VirtualBox and VBoxHeadless are the two things you want.
[04:23:16] <nofra> What's headless?
[04:23:22] <wood_quinn> Like it sounds.
[04:23:30] <KaMii> its something that doesnt have a head
[04:23:36] <nofra> Oh...
[04:23:40] <KaMii> like the headless horseman
[04:23:46] <nofra> I thought maybe it was miss tails or something
[04:23:56] <wood_quinn> You can connect to it later using RDP (or if you've already installed and have remote access set up, that)
[04:24:22] <nofra> Rather use ssh
[04:24:39] <nofra> I just want text only boxes....
[04:24:46] <nofra> Don't need no fancy X
[04:24:58] <wood_quinn> Then set up the VM using the GUI and from then on use VBoxHeadless.
[04:25:10] <nofra> There is no Headless Sbo
[04:25:12] <wood_quinn> Or use VBoxManage and forego the GUI config.
[04:25:24] <wood_quinn> Those are commands, not package.
[04:25:27] <nofra> There's no Vboxmanage SBo either
[04:25:41] <nofra> ah

[04:26:22] <nofra> How about Vbox-addons?
[04:26:36] <wood_quinn> If you want them, you download them and install them.
[04:26:44] <wood_quinn> You can use VBoxManage to do it from the console.

[04:29:20] <nofra> "To compile a headless vbox pass HEAD...." do I wantthis?
[04:30:02] <wood_quinn> There's also VBoxSDL which may allow you to have an interface on the console. But I'm not sure. Feel free to experiment.
[04:30:18] <wood_quinn> nofra: I don't know. Let me look at the README's context.

[04:31:23] <nofra> 4th sentence in the README
[04:31:38] <nofra> It has NO explanation
[04:31:56] <wood_quinn> Ah that's been added to the 14.0 branch.
[04:32:04] <wood_quinn> I'll look at the SBo.
[04:32:15] <nofra> Good plan (since that's what I'm reading)
[04:32:31] <KaMii> lol
[04:32:33] <wood_quinn> I wouldn't make a headless one.
[04:32:58] <nofra> It would be NICE if I could GUI it AND CLI it (like Xenserver)
[04:33:01] <wood_quinn> You don't need to in order to use VBoxHeadless, but if you make it headless you won't have access to a GUI or to the SDL interface.
[04:33:15] <wood_quinn> So don't pass HEADLESS=yes
[04:33:17] <nofra> THATS what I needed, thnx

[05:27:21] <nawcom> i like using slackware on my media players that mainly use xbmc. so ive been curious on plymouth. ive been using framebuffer drivers that support the highest resolution though ive never really tried getting bootsplash to work with anything bigger than 1024x768. mehbeh i should get off my ass and try it
[05:27:26] <KaMii> i dont get it... like a good neighbor state farm is there?  seriously?

[05:27:46] <KaMii> a good neighbor isnt there, they just be a good neighbor by minding their own business and leaving you the hell alone
[05:28:20] <RadicalDev> the decoder that comes with bootsplash supports 16bit consoles only, and the drawing routines screw everything up with anything other than 1024x768

[06:41:16] <d4wnr4z0r> wait, they're not?
[06:42:04] <Master-Passeli> when ravens stopped delivering my mail?
[06:42:10] <pink_mist> Urchlay: actually, there's a reason for why the ravens in GoT are rather better at delivering messages than one would expect
[06:42:11] <Urchlay> nevermore!

[06:42:41] <TommyC> d4wnr4z0r: I just had a few questions, can I /msg you real quick?
[06:42:47] <pink_mist> d4wnr4z0r: no I mean actual underlying reason relevant to the GoT world
[06:42:48] <d4wnr4z0r> TommyC: sure
[06:43:02] <d4wnr4z0r> pink_mist: so... it's in the screenplay? :p
[06:43:11] <Urchlay> Master-Passeli: I dunno what a tramboline is, is it larger than a coconut? Everyone knows you need swallows for that.
[06:43:11] <pink_mist> it's in the books :P
[06:43:18] <d4wnr4z0r> close enough :)
[06:43:35] <Urchlay> (just don't ask whether it's european or african swallows)
[06:43:45] <pink_mist> could be two of them
[06:43:50] <Master-Passeli> Urchlay: well it's family size tramboline
[06:43:51] <pink_mist> they could grip it by the husk
[06:43:58] <wood_quinn> Could be a hybrid.
[06:44:08] <Urchlay> what the heck is a tramboline?
[06:44:23] <Master-Passeli> trampoline
[06:44:26] <Urchlay> ah, OK
[06:44:35] <Urchlay> need a roc to deliver that
[06:45:11] <Urchlay> or a giant pterodactyl (like the airplanes on the Flintstones)
[06:45:27] <Master-Passeli> but back to the slackware. have you tested new firefox 18?
[06:45:31] <Urchlay> I have not
[06:45:37] Oak (~Oak@unaffiliated/alreadygone) left irc: Ping timeout: 255 seconds
[06:45:45] <Master-Passeli> is it really faster than version 17
[06:46:01] <Urchlay> I tend to put off upgrading firefox until it's convenient (like, when I have to reboot or kill the X server anyway. FF runs the entire time X is running, here)
[06:46:35] <Urchlay> as fast as they release the damn things, I sometimes end up 2 or 3 versions out of date just because of my uptime
[06:47:00] <Master-Passeli> :)
[06:47:04] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: You leave Firefox running :P
[06:47:04] <d4wnr4z0r> I upgrade it whenever
[06:47:10] <wood_quinn> Must have 24GBs of RAM :)
[06:47:12] <Urchlay> nah
[06:47:18] <d4wnr4z0r> but only end up restarting into the new version when it crashes because of the upgrade
[06:47:24] <d4wnr4z0r> ff doesn't eat much ram
[06:47:26] <Urchlay> I leave JS disabled and never leave flash animations running
[06:48:01] <Master-Passeli> Urchlay: oh, is webpages even usable nowadays without js?
[06:48:02] <wood_quinn> Ah.
[06:48:05] <Urchlay> (I only ever see flash stuff if I actually click on it in the first place, on sites where I've allowed JS)
[06:48:12] <Urchlay> Master-Passeli: a lot of them are, yes
[06:48:17] <wood_quinn> I leave Firefox open with Facebook, Google+, and Twitter open.
[06:48:17] <Master-Passeli> ok
[06:48:25] <d4wnr4z0r> and many are usable with only a subset of the js they have running
[06:48:28] <wood_quinn> That's why I always end up with zombified firefox processes.
[06:48:36] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: I've never used any of those 3 sites (and doubt I'd enjoy them)
[06:48:53] <wood_quinn> My suspicion is that it's due to the respective JavaScript loops on each site.
[06:49:01] <Master-Passeli> ff with flash and js is really eating all the memory you can give over time.
[06:49:11] <Urchlay> what's twitter besides IRC for mundanes who can't get it together enough to understand real IRC?
[06:49:12] <d4wnr4z0r> Urchlay: you're missing nothing. I've sampled them. they don't taste good.
[06:49:26] <Master-Passeli> i have ulimited my firefox instance because i ended up problem where ff starts to swap because of that
[06:49:54] <Urchlay> Master-Passeli: install noscript, let it block JS by default, and only allow it on sites where you actually need JS
[06:50:03] <Urchlay> (in my case that's basically youtube and not much else)
[06:50:20] <RadicalDev> just run VMs, and take a snapshot of an ideal point in the VMs life

[07:10:05] <RadicalDev> think it's slackware 13.37
[07:16:54] <RadicalDev> grepping for phrases in the sources is an amusing way to pass the time between kernel compilations
[07:17:14] <RadicalDev> sure do wish I could figure out why the fuck I can't sys_open files in the initrd.
[07:18:07] <RadicalDev> on an EFI system, that is. Works fine on non-EFI systems.
[07:18:20] <Urchlay> sys_open... is a perl function (or does something else beside perl use the same syntax?)
[07:18:38] <RadicalDev> it's from linux/syscalls.h
[07:18:43] <Urchlay> ah, nm then

[07:18:57] hubx (~hubx@unaffiliated/nvision) joined ##slackware.
[07:19:37] <RadicalDev> and sys_getcwd gives me a smiley face character when I printk the result.
[07:19:37] <Urchlay> pink_mist: yes, but there's no C library function called sys_open()... there is in the kernel apparently (news to me) but I doubt perl borrowed its function name from the kernel
[07:19:56] <pink_mist> hmm, yeah .. that does sound odd
[07:19:59] <Urchlay> a smiley face character is usually 0x01, for whatever that might be worth
[07:20:09] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[07:20:22] <wood_quinn> Shows where the coders' priorities were.
[07:20:34] <Urchlay> pink_mist: perl's got an open() that came first, then later versions of perl, they needed an open() that behaves more like the C one, so that one was called sys_open()
[07:20:49] <Urchlay> none of this is helping the guy that needs help, sadly
[07:20:52] <pink_mist> ahh, that makes sense I suppose
[07:21:36] <RadicalDev> oh, don't worry about me. usually after a dozen or so non-stop hours I realize I'm using the wrong initrd or something

[07:23:39] <Urchlay> you're using printk's %s, which I presume works like the user printf, treats whatever you give it as a pointer... small negative numbers probably don't point anywhere useful if you dereference them

[07:24:39] jokar (~mohsen@unaffiliated/jokar) joined ##slackware.
[07:24:51] <RadicalDev> yeah, printk works mostly like printf, except output goes to syslog
[07:25:38] <RadicalDev> sys_getcwd(char *buf, int size) -> something, success or not (trying now, actually)
[07:25:53] <RadicalDev> getcwd in userspace returns a char *, but sys_getcwd doesn't apparently.
[07:26:21] <Urchlay> pointer to some sort of directory struct maybe? or to an inode?
[07:26:23] <RadicalDev> anyway, so it's supposed to stick the path in buf and then using %s to print buf should yield something like "/"
[07:26:24] <wood_quinn> If you have a bash script and convert the code to a compiled language, is it usually faster?
[07:26:57] <pink_mist> uh, yes
[07:27:08] <wood_quinn> I Figured as much.
[07:27:27] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: if it's I/O bound, maybe not. Unless you also convert to more efficient ways of doing it (e.g. read a file into memory once and search it multiple times, instead of putting "grep $blah filename" inside a loop)
[07:27:52] <pink_mist> true
[07:28:01] <RadicalDev> it's been a long time since I messed with C, but have been doing a lot of it lately. I usually work in Python, which is fucking awesome.
[07:28:04] <pink_mist> but if it isn't I/O bound, it's usually something like 1000 times faster
[07:28:23] <pink_mist> depending on what you're doing of course
[07:28:29] <Urchlay> if it's doing lots of computations, why write it in bash in the first place?
[07:28:41] <RadicalDev> hmm... so getcwd returned -14
[07:28:49] <wood_quinn> I have two scripts in mind.
[07:28:52] <pink_mist> Urchlay: might be the only language you know
[07:28:59] <Urchlay> errno.h says that error is...?
[07:29:16] <wood_quinn> Both of which would probably be better of being built on other people's native code instead of scripted and then reimplemented.
[07:29:18] <Urchlay> pink_mist: true. wood_quinn I thought knew more than one
[07:32:22] <RadicalDev> what scripts did you have in mind?
[07:32:48] <wood_quinn> Things that grab arrays and reorder them.
[07:34:02] <wood_quinn> An SBo queue generator, a script that takes a URL and determines the uploader, title, and download link to a YouTube video, and one that gives a summary of my video library.
[07:35:42] <RadicalDev> the tuber is something I've been meaning to do for a while
[07:36:17] <RadicalDev> right now I'm converting a couple hundred gigs of flvs to mp4, but all those I downloaded manually
[07:36:31] <KaMii> handbrake?
[07:36:39] <wood_quinn> I'd like to include some parsing to put the video in a subdirectory of the uploader's, and rename it. But I'm generally abhorrent of parsers.
[07:37:11] <RadicalDev> I'm an EDI analyst.. pretty much all I do is parse
[07:37:33] <RadicalDev> I wanted to have a list of things to search for and a regex engine to match results and download them

[07:38:28] <wood_quinn> But obviously, as a Google service, searching for somethign doesn't necessarily return those results.

[07:44:33] <Urchlay> (most of it's a wasteland of crap that's either dumb, compressed so it hurts to watch/listen, or both)
[07:44:55] <RadicalDev> you'd be amazed how fast 1+hr albums in high def add up
[07:45:03] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Oh there's 720p stuff on YouTube who's creators have invested in good mics.
[07:45:18] <KaMii> just rip the audio out for music then
[07:45:25] <RadicalDev> i want the video!
[07:45:32] <wood_quinn> If I had the space I'd permanently archive some odd thousand hours of video.
[07:46:03] <Urchlay> RadicalDev: I used to collect lossless bootlegs (pink floyd mostly, also hendrix and a few others. Not zeppelin or the doors, love them but they were always too wasted to play on most bootlegs I found)
[07:46:37] <Urchlay> they do add up in a hurry, using flac only delays the inevitable "which of these should I delete to make room for more?" questions
[07:47:00] <wood_quinn> Can't say I'd watch them over and over again, but stuff on YouTube has a mysterious way of getting taken down years after the view count stops rising enough for people to miss it.
[07:47:33] <RadicalDev> never delete.. Frys -> 129$ -> 2tb HD -> back in action
[07:47:36] <wood_quinn> Though it's Google; they don't actually delete the videos. You can still get access to them.

[07:48:08] <Urchlay> heh, back when I was actively collecting, 2tb drives didn't exist yet (or maybe they did, but weren't cheap enough for me to care that they existed)
[07:48:25] <wood_quinn> High capacity drives tick me off :)
[07:48:43] <wood_quinn> 'cuz I've never had one. Dunno how anyone can fill 2TB.
[07:48:54] <wood_quinn> I'd probably manage, if I had the space.
[07:49:10] <RadicalDev> the NSA consumes so many drives HD manufacturers built separate wings just for them.
[07:49:22] <Urchlay> I've got 2TB of storage here (not in one drive though, a couple of raid5 arrays) that stays almost-full all the time
[07:49:52] <Urchlay> back when I built it, this was a decent amount of storage (I thought so anyway)
[07:50:05] <wood_quinn> Now if I had some decent bandwidth... then I'd use the space.
[07:50:09] <RadicalDev> yeah, 2TB before 2005 would have been a feat.
[07:50:30] <wood_quinn> So question, MBR can only allocate the first 2TB of a partition, correct?
[07:50:31] <Urchlay> this was more like... 2007?
[07:50:40] <RadicalDev> that's my understanding wood
[07:50:48] <RadicalDev> GPT is the magic solution to that
[07:50:48] <wood_quinn> Or is it the first 2TB of the drive?
[07:51:02] <RadicalDev> it's like the RAM deal with 32bit PCs and windows
[07:51:40] <RadicalDev> but apparently in the 512 bytes or whatever for the MBR, you can only specify up to 2TB of space
[07:51:49] <Urchlay> had 900GB in 2005 (6x180GB in raid5 config), thought that was pretty good
[07:52:12] <RadicalDev> so they use GPT instead, which designates partitions by UUID
[07:52:30] <RadicalDev> and they use a thing called the extensible firmware interface to manage that
[07:52:32] <wood_quinn> 32 bits.
[07:53:15] <Urchlay> designating by UUID... still there has to be some place they store the start/end sectors of the partition though. Probably use a lot more than 32 bits in GPT.
[07:53:18] <wood_quinn> Ah I was just wondering if you could use multiple partitions on a >2TB drive as software RAID and work around that limitation. Guess not.
[07:53:33] <RadicalDev> yeah
[07:53:51] <RadicalDev> but that's what the EFI does.
[07:54:02] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: even if you could, you wouldn't want to (raid on a single drive is noticeably slow, the heads are being jerked back & forth across the platter more than you'd like too)
[07:54:06] <RadicalDev> on your disks you have  /boot and /boot/efi partitions
[07:54:12] <RadicalDev> all the rest is up to you
[07:54:18] <wood_quinn> Looks like recent Windows, Mac OS, and remotely recent Linux kernels support up to 16TB discs.
[07:54:29] <RadicalDev> GPT supports tons of partitions
[07:54:39] <RadicalDev> not like MBR and have to futz with LVMs and whatnot
[07:54:42] <wood_quinn> But there are issues getting bootloaders and BIOSes to support it.
[07:55:02] <RadicalDev> yeah, it was a headbanging moment trying to get slackware onto my brand new laptop
[07:55:23] <RadicalDev> I didn't even know what GPT or EFI meant at the time
[07:55:43] <wood_quinn> Yeah I've heard a lot of people talking about GPT and UEFI.
[07:55:45] <Urchlay> heh, I only sort-of know, from watching people in here having the same problem
[07:55:51] <wood_quinn> It seems like the only people liking it are Windows users.
[07:56:10] <Urchlay> (one day I'll be able to afford a drive big enough to need GPT)
[07:56:20] <wood_quinn> I'll be overjoyed with UEFI when it includes hardware drivers on the board.
[07:56:40] <Urchlay> eh? like, to replace kernel hardware drivers? binary drivers are a nightmare in linux
[07:57:28] <Urchlay> (not that vendor-supplied on-board drivers would ever be provided for any OS but windows, anyway)
[07:57:30] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Maybe it was just a pipe dream, but I had heard when UEFI was getting all it's marketing craze that hardware drivers was it's main advancement over BIOS.
[07:57:51] <wood_quinn> Of course, the development quickly shifted to helpful things like SecureBoot
[07:58:13] <Urchlay> board shipping with a romdisk containing windows drivers doesn't interest me at all
[07:58:25] <RadicalDev> lol, i think the only important thing is secure boot and being able to boot gpt disks
[07:58:34] <d4wnr4z0r> s/SecureBoot/drmboot
[07:58:44] <wood_quinn> Exactly. It's not useful unless the BIOS itself is able to use the hardware and pass on that usability to the OS.
[07:58:46] <RadicalDev> yeah, absolutely
[07:59:05] <wood_quinn> Either way, it didn't happen.
[07:59:10] <wood_quinn> And I'm sure it won't unfortunately.

[08:00:55] <Urchlay> and having to reflash your bios to upgrade a driver... ugh
[08:01:05] <RadicalDev> locked down hard
[08:01:38] <Urchlay> there will always be a need for open stuff. For developers to use, for developing stuff to sell to the users of locked-down systems, if nothing else
[08:02:17] <RadicalDev> yeah, but then they'll make it a felony to code without a license, and licenses are only given to 1 in 100,000 people who apply
[08:02:20] <wood_quinn> Isn't that the truth though.
[08:02:36] <RadicalDev> unlawful possession of a compiler!
[08:02:47] <Urchlay> ...or to anyone who applies and pays the substantial application fee
[08:02:51] <wood_quinn> Ever heard of a melodramatic podcast that talks about listener licenses?
[08:03:07] <wood_quinn> Wish I could remember the name.
[08:03:23] <wood_quinn> It's set in a post-apocolyptic world where no one even knows the year anymore.
[08:03:38] <Urchlay> heh, that sounds like the last episode of "dollhouse"
[08:04:28] <wood_quinn> Gosh I can't eat sweets.
[08:04:32] <wood_quinn> I get darn thirsty.
[08:04:48] <wood_quinn> Still have stuff sitting around from Christmas and New Year's Eve.

[08:25:04] <RadicalDev> I've got slackware going fine

[08:26:24] <TommyC> oh
[08:27:24] <RadicalDev> yeah, in a normal world it would load the image from the root of the initrd
[08:27:32] <RadicalDev> but under an EFI system, it can't find the file
[08:29:19] <Urchlay> you have to pivot_root() into the ramdisk? (and then do it again for the real root partition later?)

[10:34:41] <br4ndon> Hi there
[10:35:01] <br4ndon> I'm running a headless slackware server
[10:35:29] <br4ndon> Is consile-kit-daemon indispensable?
[10:36:31] <ruskie> I don't think I have it at all
[10:36:39] <br4ndon> I've read that it manages users logging and sessions, but turning it off doesn't change anything
[10:36:40] <ruskie> even on the desktop
[10:36:52] <br4ndon> you removed it?
[10:37:01] <ruskie> never installed it more likely
[10:37:16] <br4ndon> Well it comes packed in slackware and enabled by default
[10:37:21] <ruskie> zsh: no matches found: /var/log/packages/con*
[10:37:21] <br4ndon> check your /etc/rc.d/
[10:37:38] <ruskie> no nothing like that in there
[10:37:45] <br4ndon> what the?
[10:38:00] <br4ndon> no rc.console-kit-daemon in here?
[10:38:03] <ruskie> nope
[10:38:12] <ruskie> it's actually: /etc/rc.d/rc.consolekit but no I don't have it
[10:38:18] <ruskie> /etc/rc.d/rc.M:if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.consolekit ]; then
[10:38:28] <br4ndon> ok, thanks
[10:38:30] <ruskie> I also don't have udev
[10:38:35] <br4ndon> so that thing sure is useless
[10:38:56] <ruskie> it's usable in certain circumstances iirc
[10:39:08] <ruskie> in combination with probably apps that support it and such
[10:39:14] <ruskie> I haven't looked into it at all

[10:43:02] <br4ndon> *yes why sorry
[10:43:22] <ruskie> because I had bad experince with it in the past and because static /dev with /devtmpfs to add devices quickly works fine for me
[10:43:39] <br4ndon> hm okej
[10:43:42] <ruskie> and because I don't want to edit a config file for filesystem level operations
[10:45:14] <ruskie> other than a rebuild of lvm and some patching of some init scripts it was an easy change

[10:50:38] <BogdanR> Hi. I am trying to compile something but the gcc linker can't find a header
[10:50:39] <BogdanR> http://pastie.org/pastes/5653678/text
[10:50:53] <BogdanR> What is wrong here?
[10:51:01] <ruskie> do you have both libusb's installed?
[10:51:07] <BogdanR> yes
[10:51:17] <ruskie> and can you find the header file?
[10:51:23] <BogdanR> yes
[10:51:30] <ruskie> ow it's there
[10:51:32] Action: ruskie is blind

[10:51:50] <ruskie> BogdanR, this your code?
[10:52:18] <BogdanR> No, found it on the net but is fairly simple. Let me show you
[10:52:23] <ruskie> no need
[10:52:32] <BogdanR> https://github.com/suzrik/MailNotifier-Linux-Utility/blob/master/mailLighter.c
[10:52:39] <ruskie> add -I/usr/include/libusb-1.0/
[10:52:41] <ruskie> to your build
[10:53:17] <ruskie> or replace libusb.h with libusb-1.0/libusb.h
[10:53:29] <BogdanR> Cool
[10:53:35] <BogdanR> Worked like a charm
[10:53:37] <ruskie> I believe either should work
[10:54:41] <ruskie> glad to hear it
[10:55:42] <BogdanR> I believe pkg-config is a little broken for libusb because pkg-config --libs libusb-1.0 should've also include -L
[10:56:24] <ruskie> why?
[10:56:29] <ruskie> isn't in a standard lib path?
[10:57:19] <BogdanR> Yes it is
[10:57:26] <ruskie> then not really needed
[10:58:00] <BogdanR> I see
[10:58:37] <ruskie> but yeah in certain circumstances it would make sense

[14:21:13] <zltan> i've this very strange problem on slack14. The quality of wireless connectivity (iwl3945) gets worse with uptime. Usually I have to reboot as the latency becomes intolerable even opening google.
[14:21:53] <slava_dp> change the channel
[14:22:04] <zltan> It restored normal after the reboot.
[14:22:43] <zltan> slava_dp: the router?
[14:23:42] <slava_dp> I blame interference
[14:23:51] Action: slava_dp uses iwl3945 and loves it
[14:24:18] <zltan> slava_dp: thanks, can you elaborate?
[14:25:42] <zltan> at first, I thought it was because of a kernel bug so I updated the kernel to 3.7.1 in the slackware-current mirror. Unfortunately the problem still exists
[14:26:25] <zltan> rmmod+modprobe iwl3945 doesn't work either.
[14:26:33] <slava_dp> zltan: try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11575665&postcount=6

[14:52:42] <rbn> hi, anyone had luck compiling virtualbox 4.2.6? the slackbuild is for 4.2.0 on slackbuilds.org and fails with the kernel 3.7.1, and when compiling 4.2.6 myself it aborts complaining about missing pam stuff..
[14:52:50] nofra (~an@adsl-75-54-84-135.dsl.austtx.sbcglobal.net) joined ##slackware.
[14:53:40] <slava_dp> VERSION=4.2.6 virtualbox.SlackBuild
[14:53:52] <BrokenCog> that's because you need PAM stuff.
[14:53:52] <BrokenCog> https://www.virtualbox.org/pipermail/vbox-dev/2010-December/003473.html
[14:54:44] <rbn> yeah.. unfortunately the slackbuild is split into virtualbox and virtualbox-kernel for which the source is hosted by the slackbuild author
[14:55:06] <rbn> ah
[14:55:12] <rbn> thanks about the pam stuff :)
[14:55:16] <rbn> i'll try that
[14:56:18] <slava_dp> I wonder why slackware does not yet use pam. this fact brings many more problems than it solves.

[14:58:29] <rbn> not using systemd will bring many more problems in the future, but thats the reason i've switched from arch on my laptop.. but i'm not going start ranting about systemd ;)
[14:59:50] <slava_dp> heheh. I've gone the opposite way since a while.

[15:00:12] <rbn> yeah, arch in general is fine..
[15:01:10] <slava_dp> and I've been postponing over systemd since september. eventually upgraded my laptop today, works fine.
[15:01:32] <rbn> on my desktop i've got all sorts of fuckups
[15:02:52] <rbn> fancontrol not starting even if it's enabled.. got to start it by hand every time. but i'm also unwilling to look deeper in this poettering-crap, so i shouldn't complain ;)
[15:03:35] <BrokenCog> poettering ?
[15:03:43] <rbn> systemd
[15:03:50] <rbn> pulseaudio
[15:04:34] <slava_dp> what's fancontrol for
[15:04:41] <rbn> controlling fans ;)
[15:05:11] <rbn> i've got a nvidia card, and without fancontrol it sounds like a starting airplane

[20:23:20] <eviljames> Bans are actually really rare in here.
[20:23:34] <Skywise> no, cause the bot deletes 'em
[20:23:59] <eviljames> Well, also maintains them in cases of notorious trolls.
[20:24:09] <eviljames> Any ban like Alan_Hicks just set is dropped after a set timeout iirc
[20:24:23] <eviljames> also, root!*@* is banned
[20:24:24] <Skywise> its supposed to maintain them, but for like the past 2 years its only removed them
[20:24:39] <Skywise> yeah, that ban times out

[20:24:52] <eviljames> g0v will step up to the plate and get rid of 'em

[22:31:11] <KaMii> i thought raid = backup?

[22:31:18] <TommyC> KaMii: No, more of an uptime thing imo.
[22:31:28] <TommyC> wizbit: RAID1 only needs 2 drives iirc.
[22:31:37] <wizbit> TommyC: RAID is not backup
[22:31:48] <wizbit> i would rather use that extra wasted drive as a backup drive
[22:31:53] <TommyC> wizbit: Ah, so you're looking for actual backup.
[22:31:56] <TommyC> Not an uptime sort of thing.
[22:31:57] <wood_quinn> RAID is redundancy, so if a drive fails your data is still there.
[22:32:10] <wizbit> video and music take up the most space in my setup
[22:32:13] <pink_mist> unless it's RAID0
[22:32:14] <BrokenCog> not fro backup, for data loss prevention.
[22:32:17] <KaMii> i have never done raid before
[22:32:35] <wood_quinn> But it's not intended to save you from an accidentally deleted file or a corrupted one.
[22:32:40] <wizbit> its highly unlikely a drive will suddenly stop working, it will probably show read errors first in dmesg
[22:32:43] <jerryzhou1113> when the shell terminal window open it is still root
[22:32:51] <wood_quinn> jerryzhou1113: You need to log out.
[22:32:56] <wood_quinn> As you've been told.
[22:33:00] <jerryzhou1113> ii mean  when it open it is user somethjng like
[22:33:02] <xocel> jerryzhou1113, if you are still logged in as root after closing x. type 'exit' to log out. Then log in as the user and type 'startx'
[22:33:18] <TommyC> wizbit: Well then a script like "mount /dev/sdb1 ; rsnapshot --foo --bar ; umount /dev/sdb1" in  a crond should be enough (imo).
[22:33:21] <KaMii> jerryzhou1113: because you are logged in as root and using x as root, this is not good
[22:33:24] <KaMii> never run X as root
[22:33:29] <wizbit> yep
[22:33:41] <wizbit> why does a backup drive need to be umounted?
[22:33:41] <jerryzhou1113> ok i try
[22:33:45] <KaMii> how is he in here then?  usually g0v kicks people out that login as root

[22:35:10] <wizbit> good point
[22:35:26] <wizbit> i doubt if i need that much space
[22:35:32] <TommyC> Same here.
[22:35:34] <TommyC> 3TB is a lot.
[22:35:34] <wizbit> so why bother with raid
[22:35:48] <TommyC> Plus, if you want to use a partition greater than 2TB, you'll need GPT.
[22:35:50] <wizbit> more electric, more money, more noise
[22:36:08] <wizbit> GPT?
[22:36:12] <KaMii> upload it all to google music

[22:36:19] <pink_mist> or something like that
[22:36:19] <TommyC> ^
[22:36:24] <TommyC> That's exactly right.
[22:36:27] <wizbit> partitions will not be that big
[22:36:38] <Zordrak> Nothing wrong with using gpt
[22:36:47] <pink_mist> instead of MBR, wizbit

[22:38:15] <wizbit> home users DO NOT need raid
[22:38:16] <TommyC> Hmmm? I've heard it called "MBR Partition Table" in many books, in much the same way GPT = "GUID Partition Table"
[22:38:17] <wizbit> i repeat
[22:38:18] <wizbit> home users DO NOT need raid
[22:38:22] <wood_quinn> I'm not under the impression LiLo supports GPT by default.
[22:38:32] <Zordrak> no i think thats right
[22:38:34] <wood_quinn> lilo
[22:38:52] <Zordrak> but then why would you boot from a disk with a >2TiB partition at this point?
[22:39:15] <KaMii> yea, just run luckybackup and run a cronjob
[22:39:18] <Zordrak> Either have a smaller, faster disk for your core OS.. or you parition the disk into OS and Storage

[22:40:09] <KaMii> you can have cron mount your backup, run the backup, then unmount
[22:40:39] <KaMii> i would like to find a 40 GIG wd velociraptor
[22:40:39] Action: TommyC used a floppy disk once for lilo. It was kind of cool since it actually worked.
[22:40:45] <Zordrak> wizbit: incorrect. However, your intention is right. Home users CAN need RAID if they need redundancy meaning that the machine will continue functioning in the case of error (or require speed that cannot be achieved without RAID), but RAID mis mistakenly used for "backup" when it is nothing of the sort.
[22:41:07] <wizbit> aye
[22:41:24] <wood_quinn> Maybe instead of backup, the word "archive" should be used.
[22:41:42] <KaMii> whats the difference?
[22:41:47] <Zordrak> KaMii: i dont think there is a 40GiB velociRaptor. There were 20GiB Raptor and I think 74GiB and 150GiB Raptor IIs but I'm pretty sure velociRaptors are 300GiB+
[22:41:48] <wood_quinn> Because RAID is a backup, it's just hardware backup not data backup.
[22:41:50] <Zordrak> speaking as an owner of 4
[22:41:51] <KaMii> redundancy, backup, archive, same thing
[22:42:06] <Zordrak> KaMii: Go stand in the corner.
[22:42:11] <KaMii> Zordrak: well a 74 or even 160 gig would be fine
[22:42:30] <Zordrak> Redundancy != Backup
[22:42:43] <Zordrak> Redundancy = Keeps working in time of failure.
[22:42:56] <TommyC> it's a good time to know when to backup though
[22:43:01] <Zordrak> Backup = Data still in existence when the shit hits the fan.
[22:43:22] <BrokenCog> Zordrak: backup = data still in existence when Redundancy failed.
[22:43:28] <wood_quinn> I don't really consider backup to be an emergency thing.
[22:43:35] <KaMii> then why do people sell raid backup devices like the drobo?
[22:43:40] <Zordrak> Which is why I have one 6TiB server, and another that's identical. Every <period>, server 2 is booted and duplicates server 1. Then goes back to sleep (off).
[22:43:41] <wood_quinn> I consider backup to be "I used > instead of >>" thing.
[22:43:59] <Zordrak> KaMii: Your question is incomplete.

[22:45:20] <wood_quinn> Point being, if you're worried about losing a disc use RAID.
[22:45:21] <jerryzhou> how many years did you guys use slackware
[22:45:38] <wizbit> 3TB Media Drive --->>  3TB Media Drive Backup   <--- cheap & perfect as long as i dont need more than 3TB worth of space
[22:45:40] <wood_quinn> But if you want your data to be safe, keep a backup [too]
[22:45:45] <Zordrak> I had a RAID61 system supporting an entire company. But RAID61 still has no backup.. hence it was backed up by LTO3 tape.

[22:47:25] <KaMii> meh, imo if you are cloning a server, its a backup
[22:47:41] <jerryzhou> what do you guys use slackware to do?

[22:48:41] <TommyC> Zordrak: I see what you did there.
[22:48:42] <wizbit> if i did decide to swap over in the future, can 3TB drives be used in RAID-6 ?
[22:48:46] <wood_quinn> wizbit: The video on a DVD doesn't take up 4.7GB, so you can store even moar.
[22:48:51] <TheM4ch1n3> wizbit: the space would better be used for raw video processing, become a movie studio ;)
[22:48:55] <TommyC> wizbit: Yes, but RAID6 needs a minimum of 4 physical hard drives.
[22:48:59] <wizbit> 3TB x 4 RAID-6
[22:49:01] <Zordrak> Yes, I also do. Both my TVs run XBMC from a Slackbox
[22:49:20] <Zordrak> wizbit: Why would you run RAID6?
[22:49:32] <NoFriends> 'cause it's 1 better than RAID 5
[22:49:34] <wizbit> Zordrak: RAID6 is the only RAID one should use, forget 5
[22:49:39] <TommyC> O_o
[22:49:40] <Zordrak> FAIL
[22:49:43] <TommyC> What?
[22:49:46] <KaMii> lol
[22:49:49] <Zordrak> Read this: http://blog.tpa.me.uk/high-availability-storage-with-slackware-drbd-pacemaker/
[22:49:53] <TommyC> What are the chances that 2 drives are going to fail, anyways?
[22:49:53] <Zordrak> Read the RAID section
[22:49:53] <wizbit> thats what some experts in this channel told me
[22:49:55] <KaMii> 6 is better than 5, ALWAYS
[22:49:58] <KaMii> lol
[22:50:08] <KaMii> Zordrak: seriously, what are you the raid king?
[22:50:08] <wizbit> KaMii: agree
[22:50:10] <NoFriends> TommyC: Connected to my Crap MOBOs, pretty good
[22:50:12] <KaMii> its getting annoying in here
[22:50:13] <TommyC> RAID6 is like RAID5 except it still works in case TWO drives fail instead of one.
[22:50:34] <wood_quinn> If two drives fail, don't you deserve to lose your data?
[22:50:38] <NoFriends> KaMii: What's better than 6?
[22:50:39] <TommyC> ^
[22:50:42] <KaMii> 7
[22:50:43] <wood_quinn> You clearly don't know how to buy hard drives :)
[22:50:44] Action: wizbit loves RAID convos :D
[22:50:47] <NoFriends> HECK YA
[22:50:48] <Zordrak> Yes 6>5.. point is you dont need 6 unless you are running mission critical because you will have a backup anyway. RAID6 is to prevent you losing business because your engineers cant access their data and you are losing production time
[22:50:52] <Zordrak> KaMii: Yes,
[22:50:55] <BrokenCog> the more drives in an array the more chances one will fail.
[22:51:00] <BrokenCog> hence raid 1 is best.
[22:51:06] <Zordrak> We've covered this.
[22:51:11] <BrokenCog> yes.
[22:51:11] <Zordrak> RAID is not a backup.
[22:51:25] <TommyC> Use RAID5, and save money by not buying a 4th 3TB hard drive.
[22:51:33] <KaMii> ok, NO ONE CARES ABOUT THIS RAID FLAME WAR ANYMOAR
[22:51:35] <TommyC> Plus, you should be using cron to send you e-mails when a drive is about to fail anyways.
[22:51:35] <wizbit> 3TB used in RAID-5 would be _DANGEROUS_
[22:51:45] <Zordrak> TommyC: Or use RAID1 for redundancy, and backup to offline disk or tape

[23:15:11] <Zordrak> wizbit: That was not my home setup. That was the company for which I was employed as the sole Systems Administrator and implemented the entire network (except EDA simulation) in Slackware.
[23:15:19] <nofra> Ya, bridging is dangerous
[23:15:31] <nofra> You can bridge hackers right in
[23:15:32] <KaMii> i hear a lot of *was* in that statement....

[23:25:02] <eviljames> yeah, that's what pre-teens are good at...being respectful.
[23:25:19] <wizbit> KaMii: mythtv-users channel are very helpful
[23:25:19] <KaMii> and wizbit how do you get it to change the channel on your cabel box to record a show?
[23:25:27] <wizbit> KaMii: im from UK
[23:25:30] <wood_quinn> eviljames: It's a widely known fact.
[23:25:35] <wizbit> i dont use cable
[23:25:49] <KaMii> then how do you get it to change the channel?
[23:25:51] <wizbit> KaMii: there are ways
[23:26:00] <wizbit> KaMii: i have a TV card installed in my server
[23:26:19] <KaMii> oh, well that wont help if you want to record off cable
[23:26:23] <wizbit> dvb-usb: Hauppauge Nova-T 500 Dual DVB-T successfully initialized and connected.
[23:26:31] <TheM4ch1n3> wizbit: is it hooked up to a lightning rod / antenna
[23:26:37] <wizbit> TheM4ch1n3: yes
[23:26:37] <KaMii> lol
[23:26:39] <KaMii> hope not
[23:26:53] <KaMii> so its a digital receiver card?
[23:26:57] <wizbit> mythtv is awesome, i could not live without it
[23:27:02] <wizbit> KaMii: yes
[23:27:25] <KaMii> how much hdd space does one hour video take?
[23:27:42] <wizbit> my setup is SD, do you have HD?
[23:27:48] <KaMii> no
[23:28:03] <TheM4ch1n3> wizbit has a mythtv socket behind hes left ear
[23:28:04] <wizbit> let me check

[23:29:54] <KaMii> bye
[23:29:58] <wizbit> mythtv is pretty easy, make sure all the drivers for your hardware is working first
[23:30:05] <wizbit> if thats ok, mythtv will be fine
[23:30:36] <Zordrak> wizbit: not eaxctly simple software though.. last time I checked
[23:30:55] <wizbit> it took me a few years to get my head fully around it
[23:31:01] <KaMii> well this is what i was thinkign of doing, have a mythtv server grab the video, have another machine transcode everything and store it on my media server, then play the video back on my raspberry pi
[23:31:03] <wizbit> you need to learn its way
[23:31:11] <Zordrak> wizbit: though TBH I was waiting for an XBMC front end to MythTV.. then stopped driving, so spent the insurance money on Sky :p
[23:31:37] <wizbit> hmmm
[23:31:50] <wizbit> if your skybox develops a fault, your fu****
[23:31:58] <wizbit> if myhtv develops a fault, you can debug
[23:32:01] <wizbit> and learn
[23:32:15] <wizbit> Zordrak: your from UK?
[23:32:34] <Zordrak> wizbit: sure.. but the stuff I want to keep I let others record and encode for me ;)
[23:32:40] <Zordrak> wizbit: very
[23:32:42] Action: KaMii is wondering if Zordrak is tagdy in disguise....
[23:32:48] <wizbit> eeeeek
[23:32:49] <eviljames> That would be a very clever disguise.
[23:32:50] <wizbit> :-S
[23:32:57] <KaMii> which is why he got past my ignore list
[23:33:03] <eviljames> I'm fairly certain Zordrak dates back much further than Tadgy.
[23:33:12] <Zordrak> eviljames: indeed, thank you
[23:33:20] <KaMii> doesnt mean he had multiple users
[23:33:27] <KaMii> s/had/didnt have
[23:33:33] <thumbs> he does not.
[23:33:55] <eviljames> Zordrak: I knew it was further back, but I don't recall exactly how much further.  Years, at the very least.

[23:47:35] <eviljames> Yeah, I prefer hostnames by a longshot to trying to remember IPs
[23:47:49] <eviljames> and which IP does what
[23:48:08] <KaMii> yea especially when your router is stupid and doesnt let you go static, so it plays musical ip's on you all the time
[23:48:26] <KaMii> fcking pos motorolla
[23:48:45] <Zordrak> I meant from the point of view of wizbit thinking it was a security risk to reveal them.
[23:48:58] <Zordrak> Of course they are of great use to the network itself functionally.
[23:49:12] <thumbs> KaMii: nothing prevents you from configuring each client statically outside the typical DHCP range.
[23:49:22] <KaMii> if he gets inside you network, he can now target a specific server
[23:49:50] <KaMii> thumbs: i tried that, but then the router just wouldnt issue an ip to any system, i think the router is damaged
[23:50:05] Action: thumbs is not convinced
[23:50:29] <KaMii> well i tried, it wouldnt go
[23:51:07] <KaMii> i think i will just hook up my linksys to that cable modem, because my linksys will let me do whatever I want
[23:51:58] <Zordrak> KaMii: Very naive. You dont need or care about the hostnames. One nmap scan and you know what's where anyway.. not to mention that internal to the network, all would resolve via standard DNS queries.
[23:52:30] <KaMii> yea, i know, but now we know what each system does based on their hostname
[23:52:45] <Zordrak> or.... via the open ports services are listening on
[23:52:53] <Zordrak> and the banners for each
[23:53:59] <eviljames> indeed.  Not to mention OS Signatures
[23:54:22] <eviljames> "Oh, this is a debian X system running mysql Y on port 3306, hmm. I wonder what metasploit has to say?"
[23:54:44] <eviljames> If there's enough latitude to run a port scan against your network, you're *almost* at the game over point.  Best have your patches up t odate.
