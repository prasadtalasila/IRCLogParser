[00:56:16] <jennifer> What can I do?
[00:56:48] <Skywise> there might be some space reserved
[00:56:49] <wood_quinn> You can dance.

[00:56:58] <wood_quinn> You can sail through the sky.
[00:57:06] <wood_quinn> Well, you can't do that last one without some help.
[00:57:10] <Skywise> how much more space is free
[00:57:52] <jennifer> I have 50gb on my cell phone.
[00:57:58] <jennifer> 50gb free that is.
[00:58:02] <jennifer> It's a 60gb flash disc.
[00:58:09] <FLYSWATER> Jesus Christ praise the LORD!
[00:58:19] <wood_quinn> Oh.
[00:58:20] <FLYSWATER> thats nice.
[00:58:20] <jennifer> Or whatever disc yo ucall it, could be a filesystem problem.
[00:58:27] <wood_quinn> File is too large: filesystem.
[00:58:38] <wood_quinn> Max file size must be smaller than your file.
[00:58:41] <Skywise> ahh thats it
[00:58:45] <FLYSWATER> Aj
[00:58:54] <FLYSWATER> Ah* yes, that makes sense
[00:58:57] <Skywise> 4gb is prolly the largest allowed
[00:58:58] <wood_quinn> That's what happens when you base phones off FAT16.

[01:00:24] <wood_quinn> You can compress the image.
[01:00:34] <Skywise> well, you need to split the file somehow
[01:00:36] <wood_quinn> I don't know how much you'll be able to drop that filesieze.

[01:01:03] <poprocks> When I go to services -> play cd it works for me.
[01:01:29] <jennifer> wood_quinn, I'm trying to transfer this iso file from my computer to my laptop.
[01:01:38] <wood_quinn> Then why do you need to preview it?

[01:01:52] <FLYSWATER> hm
[01:02:09] <FLYSWATER> Jennifer, what OS's are you working with?
[01:02:47] <jennifer> Slackware and Windows 8.
[01:02:53] <jennifer> I'm just transferring the iso.
[01:02:57] <Nh3xus> Hell dat Windows D:
[01:02:58] <KaMii> samba
[01:03:06] <wood_quinn> Yeah then just split(1) it.

[01:03:24] <FLYSWATER> Split it or use another way to transfer it...
[01:03:32] <Nh3xus> that's not FOSS KaMii
[01:03:37] <KaMii> apache server
[01:03:44] <wood_quinn> Split it into five pieces, then compress those, then split those into three pieces each.
[01:03:44] <Nh3xus> rsync ?
[01:04:02] <FLYSWATER> wood_quinn, is that scene standards?
[01:04:07] <FLYSWATER> lol :>
[01:04:10] <wood_quinn> Then wave a magic wand, dance, and walk around in the cold wilderness naked until your animal spirit guide shows itself to you.
[01:04:23] <wood_quinn> Or use some kind of file server.
[01:04:26] <wood_quinn> That too.
[01:04:30] <FLYSWATER> Then you can fly in the sky way up hiugh
[01:04:32] <Nh3xus> How did you met Harry Powter ?

[01:06:08] <wood_quinn> Yeah.
[01:06:10] <Nh3xus> Yes on Windows there's the command Convert for that
[01:06:16] <wood_quinn> That's what I'd recommend.
[01:06:19] <Nh3xus> convert /fs:ntfs
[01:06:20] <jennifer> I forget the command for that.

[01:14:19] <FLYSWATER> why is usermod -G not giving me a list of groups
[01:14:20] <FLYSWATER> :
[01:14:22] <FLYSWATER> :\
[01:14:43] <wood_quinn> Because that's not what it does.
[01:14:55] <wood_quinn> Running groups gives you a  list.
[01:14:55] <FLYSWATER> I figured that much.
[01:15:09] <XGizzmo> and you may have just whiped out all your groups for that user.
[01:15:15] <Nh3xus> do cat /etc/group
[01:15:24] <wood_quinn> Console groups will protect him for now.
[01:15:36] <wood_quinn> As long as he doesn't log out and back in he's safe anyway.
[01:15:58] <FLYSWATER> How do I fix that?
[01:16:11] <FLYSWATER> nh3xus thank you.

[03:09:29] <wood_quinn> Tough. Shit.
[03:09:31] <FrankD> uhh no
[03:09:47] <FrankD> your argument is ridiculous because it has absolutely nothing to do with what im saying

[03:36:22] <consfearacy> MugsyDaFish: how old are you?
[03:36:26] <MugsyDaFish> 30
[03:36:29] <consfearacy> adul add?
[03:36:32] <consfearacy> adult add?
[03:36:36] <MugsyDaFish> ADHD
[03:36:56] <consfearacy> i am 34 with no career, dropped out of college twice.. i used all kinds of medications, but now i am thinking my problem is ADD
[03:37:16] <MugsyDaFish> ask your doctor to test you
[03:37:20] <consfearacy> idiots diagnosed me as "schizoaffecitve"
[03:37:38] <consfearacy> i found that this is what they call a patient when they cannot figure out what is wrong with him
[03:38:02] <consfearacy> so i looked up adderall, and says ity has amphetamine in it
[03:38:11] <consfearacy> isnt that something that makes high?
[03:38:11] <MugsyDaFish> yeah
[03:38:18] <consfearacy> are you high all the time then?
[03:38:32] <MugsyDaFish> no
[03:38:50] <consfearacy> so, is it addictive then?
[03:38:53] <MugsyDaFish> it works differently on my brain because of the adhd
[03:38:58] <MugsyDaFish> it has a calming effect
[03:39:00] <consfearacy> ohh I see
[03:39:02] <consfearacy> dang
[03:39:08] <MugsyDaFish> allows me to focus
[03:39:09] <consfearacy> i was hoping to get high too
[03:39:13] <consfearacy> great
[03:39:15] <consfearacy> thats what i need
[03:39:44] <consfearacy> do you use anything else?
[03:39:56] <consfearacy> i read most ADD people also have either depression of anxiety
[03:40:05] <consfearacy> i been on prozac for a long time now
[03:40:11] <MugsyDaFish> im on meds for depression, and nuropathic pain
[03:40:15] <consfearacy> depression or anxiety
[03:40:34] <consfearacy> so does adderall get along well with your antidepressent?
[03:40:50] jennifer (~jennifer@unaffiliated/jennifer) joined ##slackware.
[03:40:54] <MugsyDaFish> it took me a while to find one that got along with it
[03:41:00] <jennifer> Hi, just a quick question, for a 300gb, is mkntfs supposed to take long?
[03:41:15] <consfearacy> i read on wiki that there is a risk of "serotonin syndrome" which can be deadly
[03:41:57] <MugsyDaFish> rare, but it can
[03:42:04] <consfearacy> hrm
[03:42:07] <MugsyDaFish> thats why you need a good doctor
[03:42:07] <wood_quinn> I would recommend asking a doctor rather than looking up things online.
[03:42:36] <consfearacy> right
[03:42:53] <wood_quinn> Especially in the case of psychiatric disorders, big bugs, and small communes in France.
[03:43:58] <consfearacy> so amphetamine works differently in normal brains and in ADD brains?
[03:44:10] clavius (~James@unaffiliated/clavius) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[03:44:14] <wood_quinn> Psychiatric diagnosistic criteria aren't cookbook recipies. So I'd also be hesitant to assume some diagnosis I've been classified with is a catch-all for "I don't know."
[03:44:18] <MugsyDaFish> the biggest problem I have had with the adderall is that its a CII and a pain in the ass to get filled in some areas
[03:45:14] <wood_quinn> In the field, "I don't know" means "I want to get you on some medication, but I want to get a better understanding of what's going on so I can develop a treatment plan specific to your needs."
[03:45:16] <consfearacy> what does CII stand for?

[03:46:35] <MugsyDaFish> for its abuse issues
[03:46:39] <consfearacy> A C-II prescription refers to a highly addictive and tightly controlled class of medications, also known as narcotics. Examples would be adderall, morphine sulfate, ritalin, percocet, etc.
[03:46:50] <consfearacy> so adderall is "highly addictive" is it?
[03:46:58] Munra (~munra@190.251.53.201) left irc: Quit: leaving
[03:47:04] <consfearacy> you cannot get off it?
[03:47:09] <consfearacy> if you wanted to?
[03:47:24] <wood_quinn> Not if you take your monthly dosage in a week.
[03:47:27] <wood_quinn> :)
[03:47:40] <MugsyDaFish> lol
[03:47:56] <MugsyDaFish> you doctor would taper you off of it
[03:47:57] <wood_quinn> Most psychiatric pharmas are prescribed in a manner that is intended to prevent addiction per-say.
[03:48:06] <consfearacy> well wood_quinn, on the web you can find websites and forums dedicated just for the problems of "withdrawal syndrome"... people spend a year to get off drugs like paxil
[03:48:19] <wood_quinn> But understand that a psych med isn't intended to be something you stop taking.
[03:48:33] <wood_quinn> It's very frequently a lifelong treatment plan.
[03:48:52] <consfearacy> so if it is like that just for an antidepressent, then imagine how it might be with this "highly addictive" one
[03:48:55] <wood_quinn> If that's not something you're comfortably with, there are other options available unless you've been committed.
[03:48:56] <consfearacy> withdrawal must be impossible
[03:49:27] <wood_quinn> You have to understand that withdrawal isn't really a problem.
[03:49:33] <consfearacy> sometimes you just want to stop taking it because the side effects make you even worse
[03:49:33] <wood_quinn> This isn't some diet pill.
[03:49:45] <MugsyDaFish> or an opiate
[03:50:04] <consfearacy> sometimes people want to stop taking their medication just because they get fat
[03:50:13] <wood_quinn> You can stop taking it, but you need to do it with the guidance of a medical professional so they can help you through any withdrawal symptoms you have.
[03:50:38] <consfearacy> i used risperidon and it was making me so tired... i would lie down and i would still feel so tired... it was ridiculous
[03:51:26] <wood_quinn> Well, not that it's necessarily any of my business, but did you talk to your doctor?
[03:51:34] <consfearacy> doctors are stupid
[03:51:44] <consfearacy> i ve seen many, and i never met one that has a brain
[03:51:45] <shonudo> it's all that training
[03:51:49] <consfearacy> yeah
[03:51:51] <shonudo> lol
[03:51:51] <wood_quinn> No, they're usually quite smart otherwise they wouldn't have gotten through college.
[03:52:05] <wood_quinn> Medical degrees aren't something you can coast through.
[03:52:07] <shonudo> you know, sarcasm has to be the hardest thing to convey on irc
[03:52:08] <consfearacy> yeah, so goes the story
[03:52:24] <wood_quinn> Anyway, if that's the way you feel about your doctor, fire him.
[03:52:26] <wood_quinn> Get another.
[03:52:47] <consfearacy> yeah he was charging too much anyway
[03:53:08] <consfearacy> i would rather spend the money on prostitutes
[03:53:14] <wood_quinn> Most insurance plans will enable you to get compensation for travel expenses, all you have to do is say that you don't feel your doctor was willing to commit to a treatment approach you felt was suited for you.
[03:53:26] <consfearacy> better mood treatment
[03:53:29] xocel (~xocel@101.98.159.174) joined ##slackware.
[03:54:27] <wood_quinn> Without a decent doctor, you'll never get better. So if you want to be somewhere you're not- I don't know if that description suits you- and you have medical needs precluding that, get another doctor.
[03:55:00] <consfearacy> wood_quinn: i spent 10 years going to doctors, and it was eventually myself who discovered i have ADD... and just few weeks ago
[03:55:04] <wood_quinn> Unlike most medicine, a psychiatric need requires a lifelong relationship between a patient and a doctor.
[03:55:19] <consfearacy> so, you must understand how i feel about those doctors
[03:55:22] <wood_quinn> So if you don't like 'em, obviously that's not helpful.
[03:55:34] <consfearacy> they failed to disganose me
[03:55:40] <consfearacy> err
[03:55:41] <wood_quinn> Well, again, I have to question someone that "discovers" they have an illness.
[03:56:02] <wood_quinn> Very rarely are you in an objective position with the training and experience needed to make that call.
[03:56:03] <consfearacy> i am certain
[03:56:14] <consfearacy> no, i know what i am talking about
[03:56:20] <consfearacy> well ok

[03:56:37] <sencha> consfearacy, test for what?
[03:56:46] <consfearacy> it tests you for adult ADD
[03:56:52] <consfearacy> attention deficit disorder
[03:56:54] <wood_quinn> Even doctors can't self-diagnose.
[03:57:08] <MugsyDaFish> did it give you lab work, and a CT scan of your head? :P
[03:57:13] <consfearacy> wood_quinn: i read on wiki that ADD diagnosis is tricky and it rarely ever occurs to doctors

[03:57:26] <consfearacy> MugsyDaFish: did you get all that?
[03:57:41] <wood_quinn> That doesn't change the fact that no one will help you with a problem they don't believe you have.
[03:57:47] <MugsyDaFish> I was diagnossed as a child so they put me thropugh the works
[03:57:52] <wood_quinn> No different than someone coming here with a problem with their computer.

[07:15:40] <shonudo> nope
[07:16:05] <SpaceA> roger
[07:16:33] <SpaceA> also I have a HD7850 - installing fglrx should be done straight from AMDs website, yes? or are there any slackware packages?
[07:17:29] <ruskie> straight from
[07:17:38] <ruskie> their setup has an option to generate a package for you
[07:17:46] <ruskie> so you can install that
[07:18:04] <ikla> which sound card?
[07:18:21] <SpaceA> ikla: some realtek card
[07:18:23] <SpaceA> ruskie: got it
[07:18:48] <SpaceA> one last question before I stop bothering you guys. the release announcement said 'If you'd like to try out some of the newer kernel branches, you'll find .config files for Linux 3.4.11, 3.5.4, and 3.6-rc4 in the /testing/source/ directory.' Could you guide me on how I would use those?

[07:20:13] <ikla> SpaceA
[07:20:43] <ikla> most realtek cards work fine, how are you configuring your audio?
[07:21:33] <SpaceA> the audio works all right - but I get messages hda codec out of range on kernels 3.3 and older
[07:22:22] <Skywise> SpaceA. you download the source, unpack it, link it to /usr/src/linux, then copy the .config file to /usr/src/linux then make the kernel or change the config
[07:22:27] <ikla> can you pastebin the error

[07:23:08] <ikla> SpaceA, why do you want a new kernel?
[07:23:26] <bobbydrake> isn't slackware released with 3.2.29?
[07:23:27] <elvis4526> i looked everywhere in the /var/log hiearchy, but it's not there. If pkgtool read it, it must be somehwere !!
[07:23:29] <Skywise> installed packages are listed in /var/log/packages, i don't know where the desc files go

[07:23:54] <ikla> bobbydrake, yeah
[07:24:03] <Skywise> pkgtool might of just left the desc files with the source
[07:24:03] <bobbydrake> you said you wanted a kernel less than 3.4
[07:24:22] <SpaceA> ikla: I just told you. I just assembled a new desktop and the 3.2 kernels dont work well with it. I get messages similar to these https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=131154
[07:24:37] <ikla> have you played with different options when loading the driver?
[07:24:43] <SpaceA> yes
[07:24:52] <SpaceA> and I get the same problems with 3.2 on debian as well
[07:25:04] <SpaceA> the moment I upgrade to 3.5 - the kernel behaves nicely
[07:25:20] <ikla> grab ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-current/kernels/hugesmp.s/config
[07:25:29] <ikla> and download the 3.7.1 source and use that file
[07:25:39] <elvis4526> Where is located the slack-desc file of a packages installed on a slackware installation?
[07:25:44] <elvis4526> i looked everywhere in the /var/log hiearchy, but it's not there. If pkgtool read it, it must be somehwere !!
[07:25:51] <ikla> SpaceA, have you verified that a new kernel fixes this issue?
[07:26:35] <ikla> are we seriously going to be seeing systemd be the standard across most linux distro's ?
[07:26:49] <SpaceA> ikla: yes I have. I am running 3.6 on ubuntu right now and it works like a charm
[07:27:36] <ikla> SpaceA, does the driver from ubuntu have any special options being passed when loaded?
[07:27:50] <SpaceA> so I just put that config and the source in the same directory and do make menuconfig thing?
[07:27:51] <SpaceA> ikla: no
[07:28:01] <ikla> SpaceA, how did you check? :)
[07:28:18] <elvis4526> Guys
[07:28:23] <SpaceA> ikla: because 3.6 on arch, debian and fedora work well too
[07:28:28] <elvis4526> Where the hell is a slack-desc file of a package?
[07:28:38] <elvis4526> I request the assistance of god overhere.

[07:31:11] <ikla> and pastebin it
[07:32:20] <elvis4526> oh, hell, pkgtool just cat the approriate package in /var/log/packages
[07:32:20] <elvis4526> :|
[07:32:27] <ikla> SpaceA, like I said it can most likely be fixed by passing the correct parameter to it
[07:32:48] <ikla> but you can download the source of the 3.7.x and use that file config file I gave you
[07:32:55] <ikla> err
[07:32:59] <ikla> config file that I gave ya
[07:33:00] <ikla> :)
[07:34:09] <SpaceA> ikla: The only parameter that fixes it is modprobe.blacklist = hda_intel_codec
[07:35:26] <ikla> is that being loaded in slackware and not in other distros?
[07:35:59] <ikla> SpaceA, there is already a prebuilt package with 3.7.1 ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware64-current/slackware64/k/
[07:37:00] <SpaceA> ikla: its being lodaded in other distros as well but I think they just have a newer version? And thanks!! I am assuming noarch means I can use it on x86_64?
[07:37:10] <ikla> you should be able to use that, I just jumped back on the slackware ship recently after a decade of abandonment
[07:37:27] <ikla> slackware64 is amd64
[07:37:31] <ikla> you're fine
[07:37:55] <SpaceA> awesome - does the package include headers? I need them for installing the amd drivers
[07:38:51] <ikla> sorry that was the source package

[07:40:49] <SpaceA> ikla: got it - I see them - so they include headers as well?

[08:02:46] <KaMii> its very beta
[08:04:05] <SpaceA> so you mean its just not production ready?

[08:04:38] <KaMii> well, he said he upgraded his entire system
[08:04:52] <KaMii> and if you need a differnt kernel, just compile it yourself, without using slackpkg

[08:05:04] <KaMii> why
[08:05:14] <ikla> supposedly for a sound driver issue
[08:05:15] <KaMii> what broke on 3.2.29?

[17:31:53] <Tod> i'm afraid of lilo now o_O
[17:32:09] <FLYSWATER> well my external hd is formated wrong and it stops lilo from running
[17:32:18] <FLYSWATER> it shows 'LIL' and thats all/
[17:32:25] <FLYSWATER> I remove the external hd
[17:32:26] <eviljames> FLYSWATER: That's a lilo installation problem.
[17:32:28] <FLYSWATER> and it runs fine
[17:32:32] Budd-Home (~budd@64.113.172.14) joined ##slackware.
[17:32:37] <eviljames> and/or your bios is putting the usb device ahead of onboard
[17:32:41] <Nh3xus> mhh you don't use the -t iso9660 option for the mount command ? that's what i use
[17:32:42] <Tod> i would have been happy to have LIL show up ;)
[17:32:50] <FLYSWATER> eviljames, I see.
[17:32:50] <eviljames> as a result, lilo goes to look for 0x80 (iirc) and it fails.
[17:33:02] <FLYSWATER> how do I format my external hd?
[17:33:12] <eviljames> Did you install lilo to the external drive?
[17:33:17] <wood_quinn> Nh3xus: It should autodetect for the most part.
[17:33:25] <eviljames> wood_quinn++;
[17:33:45] <Nh3xus> FLYSWATER: use mkfs command
[17:33:52] <FLYSWATER> no I installed it to root this time I believe
[17:34:15] <FLYSWATER> ok
[17:34:23] <eviljames> It may be the case that lilo ended up installed to your external drive (and thus would cause it not to find its target device)
[17:34:36] <FLYSWATER> I see

[18:54:03] <usuario> I dont think it would make a change at all
[18:54:21] <eviljames> Well, you'd be wrong.
[18:54:38] <eviljames> As the prop. drivers generally interact with the hardware as well.  There are reports of fglrx having significantly better battery life than radeon
[18:54:39] <usuario> I ran X with an hd7770 without the propietary drivers and the card stays very cool
[18:54:46] <eviljames> and I beleive teh same is true of NV, but I don't use NV stuff.
[18:54:55] <usuario> but it was using the vesa driver
[18:55:16] <eviljames> The vesa driver is always the worst option, but it wouldn't tax your chip at all, so I can understand that.

[18:56:39] <wood_quinn> Also, the proprietary drivers are completely capable of interacting with something other than X.

[19:29:38] _0bitcount (~ulises11@82.158.225.51.dyn.user.ono.com) joined ##slackware.
[19:29:52] <ttkay> buy from newegg.com, then.  They don't void your warrantee for such things.
[19:30:32] <ttkay> their selection is good, prices are decent, have good user reviews of hardware, and are really good about returns.
[19:30:46] <eviljames> Do what everyone else does and just buy parts for desktops.  laptops, buy used & cheap.
[19:31:37] <Nh3xus> I've built my desktop. It's just a little more complicated do to so with an laptop
[19:31:50] <ttkay> true, that
[19:32:13] Action: NightTiger just wipes laptops, and if there's a problem, re-installs MS Windows before getting it serviced.
[19:32:19] <eviljames> Also, I don't know if wiping the OS can be considered a violation of the warranty, which is generally on parts
[19:32:26] <Skywise> well you can't really build a laptop, but i think you can get them without an os
[19:32:43] <eviljames> Sure, if you order 1000 from Compal or whoever ;)
[19:32:47] <Skywise> you can wipe the os, you just need to put it back if you're going to return it
[19:33:06] <Skywise> asus used to have some
[19:33:10] <Nh3xus> Skywise: Yes. I want to give my money to the manufacturer that don't provide Windows-only machines
[19:33:10] <eviljames> Laptops are only made in ~3 factories anyway
[19:33:12] <ttkay> I used to buy my laptops used, but have found buying them new to be worth it.  If you're really worried about voiding the warranty, buy the laptop with the cheapest hard drive, and purchase a separate hard drive.  Store the hard drive that ships with it, and install your OS on the newer, larger hard drive.
[19:33:27] <Skywise> and toshiba did too, but you had to order from them, not a retailer
[19:33:34] <eviljames> ttkay: Good call!  Just pull the drive and replace with one of your own!
[19:33:45] <eviljames> "This computer is 100% factory, and it doesn't work" - and that's an honest statement!
[19:34:15] <ttkay> can always swap the hard drive back before sending the laptop in.
[19:34:17] <Nh3xus> Yup. "I just pressed the power button and nothing happened !"
[19:34:56] <eviljames> I've bought exactly 1 new laptop, it was the cheapest one best buy had to offer.  Why?  Because it's basically a disposable device.
[19:35:13] <Nh3xus> ttkay: Thx for the advice. I can swap the factory HDD with an SSD for example.
[19:35:22] <eviljames> now you're cooking with gas!

[19:57:16] <Skywise> but they'd never have you eviljames, cause you're evil
[19:57:37] <eviljames> Haven't you heard the American propaganda for the last 100 years or so?  Pot's evil!  Therefore, I fit right in.
[19:57:54] <eviljames> It's once they legitimize it that they'll push me out.
[19:58:44] <nofra> GREAT!  Everyone is screaming "Heath care for the metal" and they're legalizing a substance that triggers Schizophrenia....
[19:58:53] <eviljames> nofra: Proof?
[19:59:02] <eviljames> There is none, because that's misinformation.
[19:59:02] <nofra> You
[19:59:11] <nofra> I rest my case

[19:59:39] <nofra> You're just jelly  :)
[19:59:40] <eviljames> What that report _actually_ stated is that in teenagers who are genetically predisposed to psychosis, marijuana use has been correlated.
[19:59:51] <nofra> proof?
[20:00:03] <eviljames> However, a causal link is not established, as they were unable to determine if marijuana actually triggered psychosis, or if people who are predisposed to psychosis are also predisposed to marijuana use.
[20:00:12] <Skywise> actually, that report was inconclusive
[20:00:26] <eviljames> Skywise: ...yes, for the reasons I just stated.
[20:00:30] <Skywise> they found nothing and then concluded that it could happen either way
[20:00:37] <Skywise> its total bs

[20:04:15] <Skywise> they're gonna last about a year
[20:04:21] <wood_quinn> 'cuz opium dens did and clubs do so much for the betterment of the human race.
[20:04:37] <Skywise> then then novelty will go and people will just smoke at home
[20:04:44] <eviljames> wood_quinn: They've done far more good than prohibition.
[20:04:47] <wood_quinn> Which personally, I think is the right way to do it.

[20:05:16] <Skywise> well, pot dens have a better class of people and you don't really go torpid
[20:05:19] <wood_quinn> I have problems with drug usage when it creeps into my personal life.
[20:05:26] <wood_quinn> So do it at home.
[20:05:36] <wood_quinn> Doesn't matter if its a cig or a needle.
[20:05:39] <Urchlay> ttkay: I also hate talking on the phone... but I hate texting worse. You only have a fraction of someone's attention when trying to communicate by text (at least, most of my friends are like that). With an actual phone call, they've got a phone jammed into their ear, sorta forced to pay attention
[20:05:47] <eviljames> wood_quinn: wtf does that mean?  Nobody's forcing you to do any drugs
[20:05:47] <Skywise> practice responsible drug use
[20:05:59] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: get new friends ;p
[20:06:03] <wood_quinn> There's no such thing as responsible drug use when it's a social activity.
[20:06:09] <Skywise> sure there is
[20:06:20] <eviljames> wood_quinn: whatever drugs you're on right now, share.
[20:06:24] <Skywise> its just like drinking responsibly
[20:06:26] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: I agree though, voice calls are more personal
[20:06:37] <eviljames> Urchlay: with video calls you get more attention yet.

[20:06:47] <Skywise> know your limits, stay in control, don't hurt yourself or others
[20:06:48] <wood_quinn> Drinking responsibly pretty much requires you not do it as a social activity.
[20:06:54] <Urchlay> well, there's such a thing as being less irresponsible. The guy who knows he's too drunk to drive, so he takes a cab (or passes out on the couch like I did at my friends house on new years eve)
[20:07:00] <wood_quinn> It should add to, not be, the activity.
[20:07:01] <TheM4ch1n3> eviljames: unless the person doesn't like people to see them, then you get no communication
[20:07:09] <Skywise> no, people just tend to party irresponsibly cause its more radical
[20:07:16] <wood_quinn> That's my point.

[20:08:06] <wood_quinn> AAA had a free tipsy tow on New Year's.
[20:08:11] <wood_quinn> Wonder how long they've been doing that.
[20:08:24] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: most people do not like reading, thats why text's are poorly read, if read at all
[20:08:29] <Skywise> i just don't understand why people drive to where they're going to drink
[20:08:37] <Urchlay> actually tow your car? or they had a driver to drive it for you?
[20:08:47] <wood_quinn> I'm not sure which.
[20:08:49] <Skywise> thats a total non sequitor, if you're drinking you can't drive back
[20:08:59] <Skywise> so why not take a ride out in the first place
[20:09:15] <wood_quinn> That boils down to the responsibility thing.
[20:09:29] <Urchlay> I used to work as a "safe driver", doing exactly that. Drive customer home in their own car, with coworker following in his car
[20:09:38] <eviljames> yeah, that service is free around here on NYE

[20:09:48] <eviljames> and I think over the whole dec month as well.
[20:09:49] <wood_quinn> New Years drinking isn't traditionally done with a whole lot of pragmatism.
[20:10:09] <Skywise> its kinda easy to forsee
[20:10:13] <Urchlay> I couldn't make any money at it, sometimes I'd end up in the hole due to gas prices + crappy tippers
[20:10:37] <Skywise> i know some places have parties in hotels and a room is part of the package, so is dinner
[20:11:01] <Urchlay> met a guy who rides a horse, told me he could get a DUI on a horse... even if the horse is sober :)
[20:11:15] <Skywise> you can get a dui on a bicycle
[20:11:23] <Skywise> or a lawn mower
[20:11:26] <Urchlay> bicycles aren't living creatures though
[20:11:33] <Skywise> doesn't matter
[20:11:44] <Skywise> its driving under the influence
[20:11:46] <wood_quinn> Usually they'll hit you with public intox on a bike.
[20:12:07] <Urchlay> seems like the rider's state of drunkenness wouldn't translate to unsafe behavior on the horse's part
[20:12:08] <wood_quinn> Depending on previous offenses and what kind of mood they're in.

[20:12:50] <wood_quinn> Just about as dangerous to the people around you as a car.
[20:12:53] <Skywise> they don't understand cars any better then deer
[20:13:18] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: I wouldn't kick a horse, they're bigger than me
[20:13:35] <wood_quinn> Honestly, though, who the hell gets drunk then hops on a horse :)
[20:13:39] <wood_quinn> That'd be a kill.
[20:14:04] <Urchlay> this guy I was talking about does. I dunno where he parks the horse when he's busy drinking though
[20:14:16] <wood_quinn> Another good question.
[20:14:18] <Skywise> if you were drunk on a horse, and someone else was leading it, then it wouldn't be dui cause you're then a passenger
[20:14:57] <Urchlay> apparently the horse is a chick magnet
[20:15:18] <wood_quinn> If they'll ride a horse...
[20:15:18] <Skywise> when you lash a horse you're supposed to give it enough lead to graze or defend itself
[20:15:27] <Urchlay> graze? in a parking lot?
[20:15:41] <Urchlay> mmm, nutritious & tasty gravel

[21:11:43] <wood_quinn> I doubt that.
[21:12:24] <wood_quinn> Honestly, I don't see the point in supporting kernels as old as were shipped with those releases.
[21:12:32] <eviljames> 2.6 series?
[21:12:52] <wood_quinn> Not the 2.6 "series" because there are still recent kernels.
[21:12:58] <eviljames> Or are you referring to the 2.4 series in 8.x+ (until 12.x)
[21:13:06] <wood_quinn> I'm talking the specific versions and software which was written for them.
[21:13:24] <eviljames> The point: people care about backwards compatibility.
[21:13:34] <wood_quinn> Pft.
[21:13:48] <wood_quinn> Yeah then why is PAE still built in by default?
[21:14:13] <wood_quinn> No one has a legitamite reason to run CPUs without PAE, that's why.
[21:14:21] <eviljames> err
[21:14:32] <eviljames> That's like asking "Why did 386 get dropped from the kernel optimizations?"
[21:14:38] <wood_quinn> No it's not.

[21:16:15] <wood_quinn> Maybe I jump the gun, but if someone comes here with a problem and aren't running 13.37 or 14.0, I tell them to upgrade and see if it persists.
[21:16:25] <eviljames> wood_quinn: That's really bad advice.
[21:16:32] <wood_quinn> Not really.
[21:16:42] <eviljames> wood_quinn: Maybe not so much for the average desktop user, but if someone's running a service in production you can cause more harm than good by giving such advice.
[21:16:51] <wood_quinn> Most of those people have never upgraded anything, much less to a new release.
[21:17:17] <wood_quinn> eviljames: People have said they can't.
[21:17:18] Action: NyteOwl still has a 12.1 machine in use.
[21:17:20] <wood_quinn> That's fine.
[21:17:26] <XGizzmo> I still have a box running 12.2.
[21:17:50] <eviljames> and there are people with boxes significantly older than that in production, because Slackware is a stable base.
[21:17:53] <wood_quinn> But just installing 12.1, running it for six years (with all the vulnerabilities and joys that come with it), is more often the situation.

[21:19:31] <wood_quinn> Think carefully before you put words into my mouth, it may speak to your own arguments and where they originate.
[21:19:55] <eviljames> Then again, odds are if they were a competent sys admin running Slackware in production, they'd know what to update, and they'd know to ignore your adivce of 'just update your distro it dont matter lul'
[21:20:05] <wood_quinn> That's my point.
[21:20:32] <eviljames> So, you're thinking it's smart to give bad advice to people who aren't competent enough to know the difference between good and bad advice.
[21:20:35] <wood_quinn> There's a difference between someone that knows what they're doing running 12.1 and someone who just hasn't taken the time to upgrade because they didn't feel like it.
[21:20:35] <eviljames> Gotcha.
[21:21:03] <wood_quinn> Almost every person who's come in here asking for help with some old version has simply never upgraded before and didn't know how.
[21:21:24] <wood_quinn> God knows where they were going when they got off at the Slackware stop.

[21:23:42] <eviljames> Most people who consciously choose not to upgrade know why they did it, and know what's good or bad about it.
[21:23:43] <wood_quinn> I personally think not upgrading is a bad idea.
[21:24:14] <nofra> I don't upgrade because my gopher client won't build
[21:24:23] <nofra> <--- stuck on Slackware 5
[21:24:23] <eviljames> Only in the general case of a trivial desktop where it doesn't matter if there's significant upgrade breakage.
[21:24:25] <wood_quinn> Choosing to skip an upgrade, or even just putting it off, puts you in a position of risking all-out breakage when you try to do multiple upgrades when <version> drops support.
[21:24:29] <aceofspades19> wood_quinn: if you run an actual server, spend a few hours getting everything configured, you don't want to randomly upgrade and break everything
[21:24:39] <wood_quinn> eviljames, aceofspades19: See above.
[21:24:41] <eviljames> aceofspades19++;
[21:24:47] <wood_quinn> You skip one, you might as well never upgrade.
[21:25:03] <wood_quinn> Because eight years down the line you have to do everything over from scratch anyway.
[21:25:17] <eviljames> Indeed, and you might as well patch your system from the patches/ directory - the way that people who care about stability do.
[21:25:28] <aceofspades19> wood_quinn: why fix it when it ain't broken?
[21:25:32] <Dominian> I don' tuse patches.. I just configure a really good fireawll
[21:25:47] <eviljames> Dominian: and u use goog dns rite, bcuz thats the way to not get virals
[21:25:47] <wood_quinn> I guess patches/ really is the best solution.
[21:25:54] <Dominian> eviljames: that's right!
[21:26:03] <nofra> aceofspades19: 'cause compiz doesn't run on Slackware 5
[21:26:03] <eviljames> In the case where you don't want or shouldn't do a full distro upgrade, patches/ IS the best solution.
[21:26:06] <wood_quinn> Google DNS causes bacterial infections.
[21:26:34] <aceofspades19> nofra: because everyone one runs compiz on a production server :P

[21:39:11] <Dominian> well then.. there's your answer
[21:39:18] <wood_quinn> And even though my .Xmodmap is explicity clear, in new terminals Alt+# enters unicode crap.
[21:39:23] <eviljames> ... or is it complete?  I'm pretty sure they've finished that part where you won't have total breakage between versions.

[21:48:44] <higuita> eviljames: i really dont know, in the last few months i read little about *bsd  ... but there were several that freebsd had and solaris had not, reducing a lot the trust on the zfs on the freebsd

[22:21:26] <XGizzmo> eviljames: Not saying that it does not need to be fixed, I am just saying they are needed.
[22:22:35] <eviljames> Are they?  Medical research happens with or without patents.  Patenting and profit may not be the primary driver there.

[22:28:01] <wood_quinn> product protection is an ambiguous term.
[22:28:14] <wood_quinn> Don't call it protection, compensation, whatever.
[22:28:21] <wood_quinn> It's a monopoly for the sake of income.
[22:28:25] <eviljames> So, let's make it less ambiguous and use the word patent instead of product.
[22:31:16] <XGizzmo> If you can not make a product at a profit then no one will make it.

[22:33:51] <pink_mist> that just means they need to price it at a level where they *will* make a profit. if other companies sell the same thing for less, then either the other companies won't make a profit, or they have a more efficient production process .... none of this makes it so the product disappears from the market though.

[22:36:58] <pink_mist> XGizzmo: then why did you say: <eviljames> Would people stop wanting to improve medical process and technology without product protection? <XGizzmo> No <--- that?
[22:38:10] <XGizzmo> research is mostly government funded and is not aimed at making anything.
[22:38:17] <pink_mist> XGizzmo: if you think that patents are the only way for R&D to be a viable strategy, then patents are a must. but your "No" indicates otherwise.
[22:38:33] <pink_mist> XGizzmo: so then why would R&D need to be reimbursed?
[22:38:41] <pink_mist> if it's already government funded
[22:39:48] <XGizzmo> In the case of a medicine there is a ass load of cost in getting the drug approved.
[22:39:52] <wood_quinn> Not to mention the patents that Pat gets.
[22:40:23] <pink_mist> XGizzmo: that would be true for every company trying to make the product. factor it into the price.

[22:46:21] <wood_quinn> It's not unfair.
[22:46:32] <pink_mist> XGizzmo: you have a point there ... so a length for patents so they can recoup *precisely* what that cost would be good :>
[22:46:39] <wood_quinn> By definition fair is "Anyone can sell anything"
[22:46:45] <XGizzmo> pink_mist: yes
[22:47:14] <XGizzmo> As I said it is broken and needs fixed but needed.
[22:47:29] <wood_quinn> If someone spends millions desining something that costs thousands to manufacture, if I have thousands I should be completely capable of doing so.
[22:48:10] <wood_quinn> Otherwise you just end up with a never ending chase to convince <legalbody> that you indeed invented the wheel, and no one else should be able to sell cars.
[22:48:44] <wood_quinn> There's no such thing as a sane monopoly.
[22:49:08] <pink_mist> XGizzmo: or another way would be to have all the cost of getting a drug approved be refunded once it was approved

[22:52:48] <wood_quinn> You were *first*
[22:52:58] <eviljames> There's still the underlying assumption that patents are required, which we haven't proven yet.
[22:53:09] <pink_mist> but first doesn't mean anything, wood_quinn, without patents.
[22:53:21] <wood_quinn> Sure it does.
[22:53:25] <pink_mist> what?
[22:53:32] <eviljames> We did establish that people will continue to advance medical research, both process and technology, irrespective of patent protection, it seems.
[22:53:38] <wood_quinn> Go out and make a new type of food and see exactly how long you make money without someone else making money.
[22:53:50] <eviljames> Anyone want to claim that people will not continue to advance medical research without patent protection?

[23:23:35] <TheM4ch1n3> eviljames: maybe there are more people out there who prefer encrypted torrent sharing, than non-encrypted sharing
[23:23:53] <KaMii> its not a connections issue, i have dropped it down to 5
[23:24:02] <Disorganized> don't most clients prefer encrypted clients over non-encrypted these days?
[23:24:07] <KaMii> and i cant do shit on the internet with that box
[23:24:10] <TheM4ch1n3> Nh3xus: don't worry, I sometimes say: l8st
[23:25:05] <KaMii> even if I have just 1 connection, I cannot access the interent with another program
[23:25:22] <KaMii> but only on that box, the other computers have no problem
[23:25:31] <Nh3xus> Disorganized: Well it depends on the device that run the client e.g Transmission is set on unencrypted by default of compiled with the --enable-lightweight option
[23:25:42] <KaMii> so, whatever transmission is doing, its seriously got issues

[23:27:32] <ttkay> ktorrent was nice.  Then I found rtorrent.  It's much nicer.
[23:27:50] <ttkay> bittornado was nice while it lasted, but it stopped working years ago.
[23:28:17] kaleun (~kaleun@67.205.201.8) joined ##slackware.
[23:28:21] <Nh3xus> It has a Web UI ? Cuz Transmission-deamon has one

[23:30:07] <eviljames> TheM4ch1n3: Yeah, or those that do have fatter pipes.
[23:30:14] <eviljames> and are less concerned about seeding
[23:32:54] <TheM4ch1n3> yeah

[23:35:28] <KaMii> ok, its a download speed issue
[23:35:38] <KaMii> once the torrent hits a certain speed, everything else is halted
[23:35:53] <KaMii> but only on that box
[23:36:10] <KaMii> its like transmission is hijacking all internet
[23:36:22] <TheM4ch1n3> set a dl cap on it then
[23:36:32] <KaMii> fuck that shit
[23:36:39] <KaMii> im just going to get rid of transmission
[23:36:56] <eviljames> Transmission--
[23:36:58] <TheM4ch1n3> mkay
[23:36:59] <Nh3xus> Works great on my Raspberry Pi :)

[23:37:19] <TheM4ch1n3> Nh3xus: what box did you make for the RPi ?
[23:38:32] <Nh3xus> TheM4ch1n3: Actually I haven't tried ARMedSlack so my RPi runs on Debian Wheezy ARM
[23:38:46] <Nh3xus> I've built Transmission 2.75 from source
[23:39:06] <TheM4ch1n3> Nh3xus: I saw a box made from lego blocks for one
[23:39:17] <ttkay> this is the first I've heard of Transmission .. it's a new bittorrent client?
[23:39:17] <KaMii> transmission is good, if thats the only program running on your box
[23:39:47] <TheM4ch1n3> Nh3xus: are you running it without a box ?
[23:39:51] <Nh3xus> KaMii: At the moment my RPi only runs an OpenSSH daemon and Transmission-deamon
[23:39:56] <eviljames> ttkay: Nah, it's pretty old, it's included in most gnome-based distros
[23:40:09] <ttkay> thanks, eviljames
[23:40:15] <TheM4ch1n3> Nh3xus: I am just asking because I hear it does not come with its own box
[23:40:25] <ttkay> never been a fan of gnome, so it's not surprising I haven't encountered it
[23:40:31] <eviljames> TheM4ch1n3: I bought a case kit on ebay for ~ $10 for my rpi
[23:40:37] <Nh3xus> TheM4ch1n3: Yes headless setup with an load of 22 Mo of RAM with 51 seeding torrents
[23:40:44] <KaMii> i made my own case from legos
[23:40:49] <TheM4ch1n3> Nh3xus: yeah, armedslack will need you to follow a guide, or be very intuitive
[23:41:04] <Nh3xus> I've ordered a transparent case from the Farnell website
[23:41:11] <Nh3xus> looks cool
[23:41:20] <TheM4ch1n3> KaMii: awesome !
[23:41:23] <KaMii> my lego case beats your transparent case

[23:41:40] <Nh3xus> I've no doubt on that statement.
[23:41:41] <TheM4ch1n3> eviljames: 'case kit' , did you have to build the case from parts still ?
[23:41:42] <Nh3xus> :)
[23:41:48] <KaMii> i just need some fiber lines so I can hook up the lights to the lego lights

[23:42:28] <Nh3xus> TheM4ch1n3: The RPi is sold with no accessories by default, you only get the board
[23:42:33] <eviljames> TheM4ch1n3: yeah, it was basically 2 pieces of pre-cut acrylic w/ access to the various ports + risers
[23:42:45] <TheM4ch1n3> KaMii: it is good if you have lego's, otherwise one may look a little daft buying lego blocks in a shop
[23:42:47] <eviljames> + some screws & such to hold it all together :P
[23:43:21] <TheM4ch1n3> Nh3xus: ok, good to know
[23:43:50] <TheM4ch1n3> eviljames: what about some tiny screen for it ?
[23:43:57] <Nh3xus> TheM4ch1n3: You can save money by powering it with your mobile phone AC adapter
[23:44:04] <Nh3xus> that's how i power mine
[23:44:46] <eviljames> Nh3xus: A powered usb hub + plugging the pi on both ends powers it + adds USB ports :D
[23:44:48] phe (~phe@wikimedia/phe) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[23:44:49] <TheM4ch1n3> Nh3xus: if you plug the USB power, into your PC, can you send data via the same plug, or is plugging it in the PC usb a bad idea ?
[23:44:59] <eviljames> no, you can't send data via the same plug
[23:45:00] <eviljames> afaik
[23:45:21] <TheM4ch1n3> eviljames: ok, and the PC does not mind giving power to it via that method ?
[23:45:23] <Nh3xus> james is correct
[23:45:28] Zapwai (~Zapwai@unaffiliaed/zapwai) joined ##slackware.
[23:45:29] <Nh3xus> It will only power the board
[23:45:37] <TheM4ch1n3> ok
[23:45:43] <eviljames> TheM4ch1n3: Not at all, the thing is very low power
[23:45:52] <Nh3xus> The PC doesn't mind
[23:45:58] <TheM4ch1n3> what does lsusb.py show ?
[23:46:14] Action: TheM4ch1n3 imagines around 500ma
[23:46:27] <FLYSWATER> How do I run a .bat file in wine?
[23:46:47] <TheM4ch1n3> FLYSWATER: with fingers crossed ! ?
[23:46:57] <Nh3xus> TheM4ch1n3: You just have to remember that the Usb 2.0 is current limited
[23:46:59] <sencha> FLYSWATER, run cmd.exe and then execute the .bat file in the command prompt
[23:47:02] <FLYSWATER> With Fingers crossed? !
[23:47:17] <keepishop> Anyone here know about GPU failures?
[23:47:29] <FLYSWATER> cmd must be installed with wine right?
[23:47:33] <keepishop> Also, I'm a father now.
[23:47:46] <sencha> FLYSWATER, you might just be able to type something like winecmd file.bat
[23:47:55] <Nh3xus> TheM4ch1n3: Any kind of high current USB based device hooked to the Pi needs an external power source
[23:48:00] <TheM4ch1n3> FLYSWATER: wineconsole
[23:48:01] <sencha> FLYSWATER, not sure, I don't have wine installed currently
[23:48:06] <sencha> ah, wineconsole
[23:48:08] <sencha> thanks TheM4ch1n3

[23:48:54] <keepishop> So yeah. My video card died.
[23:48:55] <Nh3xus> TheM4ch1n3: I've plugged an Sata HDD on it via a USB dock that has it's own power source and added the HDD to my fstab
[23:49:01] <FLYSWATER> Ive been upducted
[23:49:02] <FLYSWATER> lol
[23:49:05] <keepishop> Blew some caps and now shows fuzzy crap.
[23:49:24] <keepishop> Wondering if replacing the caps will fix it, or if there is gpu damage.
[23:49:34] <keepishop> Totally new to this stuff. :/
[23:50:32] <TheM4ch1n3> Nh3xus: sweet, cause flash for a hard-drive will not last, it is good for read-only(or mostly) access though

[23:51:28] <TheM4ch1n3> keepishop: how did this happen ,,, running the box open, and a canary flew into it ?
[23:51:42] <TheM4ch1n3> or a seagull
[23:51:46] <keepishop> Ran it with the power connector on the vid card not connected.
[23:51:55] <keepishop> I am ASSUMING that caused it. :/
[23:52:02] <keepishop> Stupid nvidia.
[23:52:09] <keepishop> Obviously not my fault.
[23:52:29] <TheM4ch1n3> keepishop: I thought when the card was in the PCIE slot, it was powered, what do you mean ??
[23:52:49] <keepishop> It had an extra power connector, but functioned without using it.
[23:53:00] <TheM4ch1n3> bizarre
[23:53:18] <keepishop> Was a $10 garage sale geforce 8600.
[23:53:22] <keepishop> Media center PC.
[23:53:34] <gnisho> Nah, there's a ton of video cards requiring external power for accellerated modes but not 2d/desktop
[23:53:48] <TheM4ch1n3> try google this -> ' geforce 8600 criticm'
[23:53:55] <keepishop> It died after I started using novou briefly.
