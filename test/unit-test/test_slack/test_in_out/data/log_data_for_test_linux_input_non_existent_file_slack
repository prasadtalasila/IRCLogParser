p887
aS'[03:37:16] <MugsyDaFish> ask your doctor to test you\n'
p888
aS'[03:37:20] <consfearacy> idiots diagnosed me as "schizoaffecitve"\n'
p889
aS'[03:37:38] <consfearacy> i found that this is what they call a patient when they cannot figure out what is wrong with him\n'
p890
aS'[03:38:02] <consfearacy> so i looked up adderall, and says ity has amphetamine in it\n'
p891
aS'[03:38:11] <consfearacy> isnt that something that makes high?\n'
p892
aS'[03:38:11] <MugsyDaFish> yeah\n'
p893
aS'[03:38:18] <consfearacy> are you high all the time then?\n'
p894
aS'[03:38:32] <MugsyDaFish> no\n'
p895
aS'[03:38:50] <consfearacy> so, is it addictive then?\n'
p896
aS'[03:38:53] <MugsyDaFish> it works differently on my brain because of the adhd\n'
p897
aS'[03:38:58] <MugsyDaFish> it has a calming effect\n'
p898
aS'[03:39:00] <consfearacy> ohh I see\n'
p899
aS'[03:39:02] <consfearacy> dang\n'
p900
aS'[03:39:08] <MugsyDaFish> allows me to focus\n'
p901
aS'[03:39:09] <consfearacy> i was hoping to get high too\n'
p902
aS'[03:39:13] <consfearacy> great\n'
p903
aS'[03:39:15] <consfearacy> thats what i need\n'
p904
aS'[03:39:44] <consfearacy> do you use anything else?\n'
p905
aS'[03:39:56] <consfearacy> i read most ADD people also have either depression of anxiety\n'
p906
aS'[03:40:05] <consfearacy> i been on prozac for a long time now\n'
p907
aS'[03:40:11] <MugsyDaFish> im on meds for depression, and nuropathic pain\n'
p908
aS'[03:40:15] <consfearacy> depression or anxiety\n'
p909

p913
aS'[03:41:15] <consfearacy> i read on wiki that there is a risk of "serotonin syndrome" which can be deadly\n'
p914
aS'[03:41:57] <MugsyDaFish> rare, but it can\n'
p915
aS'[03:42:04] <consfearacy> hrm\n'
p916
aS'[03:42:07] <MugsyDaFish> thats why you need a good doctor\n'
p917
aS'[03:42:07] <wood_quinn> I would recommend asking a doctor rather than looking up things online.\n'
p918
aS'[03:42:36] <consfearacy> right\n'
p919
aS'[03:42:53] <wood_quinn> Especially in the case of psychiatric disorders, big bugs, and small communes in France.\n'
p920
aS'[03:43:58] <consfearacy> so amphetamine works differently in normal brains and in ADD brains?\n'
p921
aS'[03:44:10] clavius (~James@unaffiliated/clavius) left irc: Quit: Leaving\n'
p922
aS'[03:44:14] <wood_quinn> Psychiatric diagnosistic criteria aren\'t cookbook recipies. So I\'d also be hesitant to assume some diagnosis I\'ve been classified with is a catch-all for "I don\'t know."\n'
p923
aS'[03:44:18] <MugsyDaFish> the biggest problem I have had with the adderall is that its a CII and a pain in the ass to get filled in some areas\n'
p924
aS'[03:45:14] <wood_quinn> In the field, "I don\'t know" means "I want to get you on some medication, but I want to get a better understanding of what\'s going on so I can develop a treatment plan specific to your needs."\n'
p925
aS'[03:45:16] <consfearacy> what does CII stand for?\n'

p932
aS'[03:46:39] <consfearacy> A C-II prescription refers to a highly addictive and tightly controlled class of medications, also known as narcotics. Examples would be adderall, morphine sulfate, ritalin, percocet, etc.\n'
p933
aS'[03:46:50] <consfearacy> so adderall is "highly addictive" is it?\n'

p937
aS'[03:47:24] <wood_quinn> Not if you take your monthly dosage in a week.\n'
p938
aS'[03:47:27] <wood_quinn> :)\n'
p939
aS'[03:47:40] <MugsyDaFish> lol\n'
p940
aS'[03:47:56] <MugsyDaFish> you doctor would taper you off of it\n'
p941
aS'[03:47:57] <wood_quinn> Most psychiatric pharmas are prescribed in a manner that is intended to prevent addiction per-say.\n'
p942
aS'[03:48:06] <consfearacy> well wood_quinn, on the web you can find websites and forums dedicated just for the problems of "withdrawal syndrome"... people spend a year to get off drugs like paxil\n'
p943
aS"[03:48:19] <wood_quinn> But understand that a psych med isn't intended to be something you stop taking.\n"
p944
aS"[03:48:33] <wood_quinn> It's very frequently a lifelong treatment plan.\n"
p945
aS'[03:48:52] <consfearacy> so if it is like that just for an antidepressent, then imagine how it might be with this "highly addictive" one\n'
p946
aS"[03:48:55] <wood_quinn> If that's not something you're comfortably with, there are other options available unless you've been committed.\n"
p947
aS'[03:48:56] <consfearacy> withdrawal must be impossible\n'
p948
aS"[03:49:27] <wood_quinn> You have to understand that withdrawal isn't really a problem.\n"
p949
aS'[03:49:33] <consfearacy> sometimes you just want to stop taking it because the side effects make you even worse\n'
p950
aS"[03:49:33] <wood_quinn> This isn't some diet pill.\n"
p951
aS'[03:49:45] <MugsyDaFish> or an opiate\n'
p952
aS'[03:50:04] <consfearacy> sometimes people want to stop taking their medication just because they get fat\n'
p953
aS'[03:50:13] <wood_quinn> You can stop taking it, but you need to do it with the guidance of a medical professional so they can help you through any withdrawal symptoms you have.\n'
p954
aS'[03:50:38] <consfearacy> i used risperidon and it was making me so tired... i would lie down and i would still feel so tired... it was ridiculous\n'
p955
aS"[03:51:26] <wood_quinn> Well, not that it's necessarily any of my business, but did you talk to your doctor?\n"
p956
aS'[03:51:34] <consfearacy> doctors are stupid\n'
p957
aS'[03:51:44] <consfearacy> i ve seen many, and i never met one that has a brain\n'

aS'[03:52:07] <shonudo> you know, sarcasm has to be the hardest thing to convey on irc\n'
p964
aS'[03:52:08] <consfearacy> yeah, so goes the story\n'
p965
aS"[03:52:24] <wood_quinn> Anyway, if that's the way you feel about your doctor, fire him.\n"
p966
aS'[03:52:26] <wood_quinn> Get another.\n'
p967
aS'[03:52:47] <consfearacy> yeah he was charging too much anyway\n'
p968
aS'[03:53:08] <consfearacy> i would rather spend the money on prostitutes\n'
p969
aS"[03:53:14] <wood_quinn> Most insurance plans will enable you to get compensation for travel expenses, all you have to do is say that you don't feel your doctor was willing to commit to a treatment approach you felt was suited for you.\n"

p973
aS'[03:55:00] <consfearacy> wood_quinn: i spent 10 years going to doctors, and it was eventually myself who discovered i have ADD... and just few weeks ago\n'
p974
aS'[03:55:04] <wood_quinn> Unlike most medicine, a psychiatric need requires a lifelong relationship between a patient and a doctor.\n'
p975
aS'[03:55:19] <consfearacy> so, you must understand how i feel about those doctors\n'
p976
aS"[03:55:22] <wood_quinn> So if you don't like 'em, obviously that's not helpful.\n"

p2310
aS"[21:14:38] <wood_quinn> No it's not.\n"
p2311
aS'[21:14:42] <eviljames> Because no 386 ever had enough ram to load the kernel.\n'

p2322
aS"[21:16:15] <wood_quinn> Maybe I jump the gun, but if someone comes here with a problem and aren't running 13.37 or 14.0, I tell them to upgrade and see if it persists.\n"

aS"[21:16:25] <eviljames> wood_quinn: That's really bad advice.\n"
p2324

p2325
aS"[21:16:42] <eviljames> wood_quinn: Maybe not so much for the average desktop user, but if someone's running a service in production you can cause more harm than good by giving such advice.\n"
p2326

p2331
aS'[21:17:50] <eviljames> and there are people with boxes significantly older than that in production, because Slackware is a stable base.\n'

p2341
aS"[21:20:05] <wood_quinn> That's my point.\n"
p2342

p6027
aS"[03:22:50] <poprocks> yeah you need to escape it. Otherwise '.' is a regexp\n"
p6028

aS'[06:26:42] <wood_quinn> Yep.\n'
p6387
aS"[06:26:54] <wood_quinn> MPlayer uses OSS' ALSA emulation.\n"
p6388
aS'[06:26:58] <wood_quinn> Flash uses ALSA.\n'
p6389
aS'[06:27:39] <wood_quinn> Your problem was that you were trying to access the sound hardware using two different drivers at once.\n'
p6390
aS'[06:27:58] <shonudo> and that always makes a funny sound\n'
p6391
aS'[06:28:05] <shonudo> (that only dogs can hear)\n'
p6392
aS'[06:28:20] <teamedward> yeah, that makes sense\n'
p6393
aS'[06:28:25] <wood_quinn> Now as for MPlayer "locking up" and "fell all the way down to null" I can\'t tell you.\n'
p6394
aS'[06:28:41] <KaMii> i built this gnomish sound device, makes it so you can hear the noise also\n'
p6395
aS'[06:29:03] <wood_quinn> Gnomish?\n'
p6396
aS'[06:29:14] <shonudo> i was about to ask the same thing...\n'
p6397
aS"[06:29:17] <wood_quinn> Like the little santas that are in people's yards?\n"
p6398
aS'[06:29:26] <wood_quinn> Or the gross ones from Harry Potter?\n'
p6399
aS'[06:29:31] <shonudo> or the thing from travelocity?\n'

p6402
aS'[06:29:40] <wood_quinn> Oh ok.\n'
p6403
aS"[06:30:36] <teamedward> so how the hell do i get X to use strictly OSS' ALSA or strictly ALSA?\n"
p6404
aS"[06:30:43] <wood_quinn> You can't.\n"

p6407
aS'[06:31:12] <wood_quinn> MPlayer can be told to use ALSA by using "mplayer -ao alsa"\n'
p6408
aS"[06:31:34] <teamedward> which didn't work in my case, because from console, X was already using it\n"
p6409
aS'[06:31:40] <teamedward> does that make sense?\n'
p6410
aS'[06:32:15] <wood_quinn> "X" doesn\'t use an audio driver.\n'
p6411
aS"[06:32:18] <wood_quinn> Because X doesn't do audio.\n"
p6412
aS'[06:33:20] <shonudo> or windows\n'
p6413
aS"[06:33:48] <shonudo> hmmm, that had an interesting double meaning i didn't intend when i typed it\n"

aS'[06:34:17] <wood_quinn> shonudo: Master of profound... ness.\n'
p6415
aS'[06:35:17] <Demon_Fox> I wonder if Google offers such fast internet for market research?\n'
p6416
aS"[06:35:27] <teamedward> ok so let's start over.  I have a hardware device, HDA_something... in order to use that device, there needs to be an interface to it, which is ALSA\n"
p6417
aS'[06:35:31] <teamedward> is that correct so far?\n'
p6418
aS'[06:35:56] <wood_quinn> ALSA is a driver.\n'
p6419
aS"[06:37:45] <shonudo> and x is the butler/housekeeper that doesn't do audio or windows\n"
p6420
aS'[06:38:08] <shonudo> so, so far you have a chauffeur and a butler\n'
p6421

aS"[07:19:41] <Skywise> i don't trust gov't enough to use their services\n"
p6517
aS'[07:19:50] <wood_quinn> Just use Tor.\n'

p6523
aS"[07:21:57] <Skywise> if you could trust them to run it agnostically, it'd be a good thing, but i just think they'd grant themselves all sorts of privileges without your consent\n"

aS'[23:49:13] <mad_enz> hplc: correct, you are in control. The package list is not that all sensitive. you simply need to get familiar with it\n'
p8760
aS'[23:50:31] <mad_enz> hplc: u could do something like slackpkg install kde to install all kde packages\n'
p8761
aS'[23:51:01] <hplc> still so many seem to end up with a corrupt list?, it feels like walking in cambodia, i.e "watch where you put down your F**ing foot"\n'
p8762
aS'[23:51:23] <hplc> sorry for my language\n'
p8763
aS'[23:51:33] <hplc> just couldnt help it\n'
p8764
aS'[23:51:48] <Schism-> well, in other distros you can end up in dependency hell with corrupt databases or inconsistent libraries\n'
p8765
aS"[23:51:53] <mad_enz> actually, it's nothing like that\n"
p8766
aS"[23:51:57] <wed> Dare to screw up a bit, It's good learning\n"
p8767
aS'[23:52:36] <mad_enz> IMHO, auto dependency install is more like being in cambodia...one wrong dependency and ur system is toast\n'
p8768
aS'[23:53:35] <hplc> hmm my first install, perhaps a deliberate screw-up or two could be of use in the process of learning\n'
p8769
aS"[23:53:45] <poprocks> It's like I was saying to an old friend of mine on google+ today.  Sure, auto-dep-resolution is kind of nice for end users.  But on a server setup, if you run an application and it complains about missing libraries or symbols, and you don't know how to resolve that issue, you probably shouldn't be a UNIX sysadmin.\n"
p8770
aS'[23:54:19] <KaMii> whats wrong with just installing everything?\n'
p8771
aS'[23:54:30] <hplc> have to agree with poprocks on that one\n'
p8772
aS'[23:55:29] <KaMii> i dont understand why new people come into slackware and decide to choose an expert install\n'
p8773
aS'[23:55:35] <mad_enz> installing everything is so much bloat\n'
p8774
aS'[23:55:53] <mad_enz> how else will they learn how to fix things?\n'
p8775
aS"[23:55:54] <KaMii> even most of the 'experts' still run a full install of linux because we have better things to do than sift through packages\n"
p8776
aS"[23:55:55] <wood_quinn> xla113: I've been using Slackware for three years, and I've been using Linux for about six.\n"
p8777
aS"[23:56:01] <wood_quinn> Not that that's relevant.\n"
p8778
aS'[23:56:02] <KaMii> mad_enz: its not bload\n'
p8779
aS'[23:56:12] <KaMii> if you are not using it, it will never be hitting your reources\n'
p8780
aS'[23:56:24] <wood_quinn> Unless you have a small disc.\n'
p8781
aS"[23:56:47] <poprocks> Meh. A full install on Slackware isn't that bloated, given how cheap and readily available disk space is these days. ~ 7.3 GB?  Pffft.  Some *single games* are twice that size.\n"
p8782
aS'[23:56:48] <mad_enz> not when disk space is a premium...\n'
p8783
aS'[23:56:51] <wood_quinn> But ~8GB is usually not much.\n'
p8784
aS'[23:56:54] <hplc> todays TB HDD sure allows for it\n'
p8785
aS"[23:57:02] <poprocks> Plus, subtract KDE and it's not bloated *at all*\n"
p8786
aS"[23:57:12] <wood_quinn> If you want to save disc space, don't install KDE, KDEI, XFCE, or XAP.\n"
p8787
aS'[23:57:14] <KaMii> wood_quinn: then get with 2013 and buy a decent sized hdd\n'
p8788
aS'[23:57:19] <KaMii> hdd space is cheap\n'
p8789
aS'[23:57:29] <mad_enz> cheap for you maybe\n'

aS'[23:58:03] <mad_enz> every bit is a precious commodity in my house\n'
p8793
aS"[23:58:13] <wed> It's a bit of a bother actually. I enjoy having the system on a device of its own. But there are no small disks left in the world\n"
p8794
aS'[23:58:13] <KaMii> i dont understand how people come to the blind conclusion that a full isntall of slackware is bloat\n'
p8795
aS"[23:58:13] <poprocks> wood_quinn: true, but if you eliminate those particular floppysets, with what you have left you're certainly not going to have any dep issues\n"

p8798
aS'[23:59:02] <mad_enz> i would never advise anyone to do a full install...noobs need to learn and no better way than picking through packages\n'
p8799
aS'[23:59:13] <wood_quinn> mad_enz: No.\n'
p8800
aS'[23:59:16] <wood_quinn> Just no.\n'

aS'[23:59:19] <mad_enz> yes!\n'
p8802
aS"[23:59:29] <wood_quinn> Picking through package names/descriptions doesn't teach you anything.\n"
