[02:32:51] <Nh3xus> poprocks: Is your bro interested in Linux ?
[02:33:21] <shonudo> i was wondering the same thing...
[02:33:27] <shonudo> why win8?
[02:34:09] <poprocks> No, he's not interested. He had a MacBook that served him well for a few years and he really liked it, but he wanted to get into gaming so he bought a relatively powerful laptop that came with Win8.
[02:34:55] <ttkay> because it's one version "better" than win7?  Or maybe he depends on a specific application which only exists for Windows.  Why else does anyone use crappy microsoft software?
[02:34:56] <poprocks> He doesn't mind using an OS he may not like as much as another as long as he can accomplish what he would like to accomplish on it.
[02:34:59] Action: Nh3xus *sigh*
[02:35:43] <ttkay> I know geeks who use and love linux at work, but windows at home because their hobbies depend on some windows-specific app or another
[02:35:54] <Nh3xus> Yeah it suck that most "blockbuster" games use the Direct X thing instead of OpenGL
[02:36:29] <shonudo> your brother sounds very pragmatic; if i were into gaming, i'd be on windows
[02:36:31] <shonudo> no question
[02:36:37] <poprocks> The Family Court forms I need don't run too well in {Open,Libre}Office, but Office 2003 runs really well under Wine so I'm gold.
[02:36:38] <ttkay> gaming, photography, video editing, landscaping .. linux is third-string behind MacOSX and Windows in these things
[02:37:28] <shonudo> poprocks, i've gotten around almost all of that with libreoffice (fwiw)
[02:37:36] <poprocks> I'm more of a retrogamer so Linux serves all of my gaming needs, but if I was into modern games I'd probably have a Windows partition
[02:37:49] <ttkay> me too, poprocks
[02:38:23] <ttkay> the only games I play anymore are either online, freeciv, or from the 1980's (and run under dosbox)
[02:38:25] <poprocks> I prefer LibreOffice and I do all my letters on there, and all the precedents I have created myself are in ODF.  But the court forms' formatting breaks when I open them in OOo
[02:39:06] <poprocks> ttkay: nice, I've always wanted to get into freeciv but it seems too complicated for me to understand ;-)  I play lots of SNES games with ZSNES on my Linux machines

[05:05:07] <alisonken1home> legally yes - either an ordained minster from  a recognized faith or a license from the state
[05:05:11] <Skywise> yeah, you don't wanna get those 2 mixed up
[05:05:20] <KaMii> is it like a drivers license?
[05:05:27] <alisonken1home> not quite
[05:05:32] <Skywise> only you don't have to renew it
[05:05:35] <KaMii> dont blow a 0.08 or you will be marrying or burrying under the influence

[06:21:01] <darwin> I would have to find the command
[06:21:06] <darwin> I restarted rc.inet1 anyway
[06:21:17] <Skywise> did you try the uparrow?
[06:21:28] <KaMii> lol
[06:23:54] <darwin> it was something like: iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport $port --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP

[06:28:37] <TommyC> darwin: You could always just...not run a firewall.
[06:28:39] <darwin> actually, it was not rc.inet1 where I thought I read that
[06:28:47] <darwin> I am not running one unless Slackware does by default
[06:28:56] <TommyC> Slackware doesn't run one by default.
[06:28:58] <darwin> I did not set one up on my router either, and it had been working before I changed ISPs
[06:29:15] <TommyC> rc.inet2 starts an /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall script if it exists and is executable, otherwise nothing
[06:29:48] <TommyC> Anyways, with that note: Does anybody know if it's possible to install Slackware *without* aaa_elflibs granted you have the necessary depenendencies that aaa_elflibs takes care of?

[06:33:01] <darwin> ok; I am just wondering how to restart it then
[06:33:07] <darwin> if it had even started
[06:33:26] <Skywise> only half a chicken
[06:33:32] <Skywise> ?
[06:34:13] <TommyC> darwin: iptables --flush
[06:34:21] <Skywise> -X -F
[06:34:22] <TommyC> that'll flush iptables' FILTER table
[06:34:53] <TommyC> yeah you might want --delete-chain like Skywise suggested since you did set some custom stuff.
[06:35:02] <darwin> oh, it turned out the port was not closed, but I just got curious about iptables
[06:35:10] <darwin> I checked it with nmap
[06:35:46] <darwin> I found the reverse of the command above, but I am only 90% sure that was the command
[06:35:54] <darwin> (the command I mentioned)
[06:36:18] <KaMii> yea it was like, still developing

[06:38:57] <Urchlay> TommyC: the trouble with leaving out aaa_elflibs is, the doinst.sh scripts for other packages might not run (because they come alphabetically before glibc-solibs, or because they're in the A or AP series and they need something from L)

[06:45:58] <TommyC> Urchlay: I wanted to see if a minimal installation of Slackware could do without aaa_elflibs.
[06:46:24] <TommyC> But if I can't remove it *during* installation, I was hoping I could remove it at least *after* installation.
[06:46:35] <Urchlay> if you have all the actual library packages installed, then aaa_elflibs doesn't actually take up any space
[06:46:50] <Urchlay> (well, except its description and such, in /var/log/packages)
[06:47:24] <poprocks> It would depend on what packages you happen to want to include in your "minimal" installation
[06:48:39] <Urchlay> yeah, how minimal is minimal?
[06:48:53] <TommyC> I'm still working on that. ^_^
[06:49:34] <darwin> are you doing something like 'LFS?'
[06:50:22] <Urchlay> basically my answer to "can I remove aaa_elflibs?" is... if you don't already know the answer to that question, then the answer is "no"... although another answer is "try it and see, be prepared for breakage"
[06:50:56] <TommyC> Urchlay: I'll be doing it in qemu, so it's all good. :)
[06:51:16] <Urchlay> right, so the answer is "if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces"
[06:51:27] <KaMii> lol
[06:51:40] <TommyC> I'm looking at "less /var/log/packages/aaa_elflibs right now to see which shared objects aaa_elflibs uses.
[06:51:50] <KaMii> how do you know it will break into just two pieces?
[06:52:41] <poprocks> many of them do not seem necessary to run (many) postinst scripts.  Some (eg, libgcc_s.so) probably are
[06:52:45] <Urchlay> every single one of aaa_elflib's shared libs also exists in some other slack package. If you have all of them installed, then "removepkg aaa_elflibs" won't remove any of them (removepkg says "file blahblah.so exists in another package, skipping")

[06:53:51] <Urchlay> (the above statement about aaa_elflibs doesn't necessarily apply to -current!)
[06:54:41] <poprocks> I was reading that 'aaa_elflibs' was once called 'elflibs' and was renamed to the former since if it happened to get alphabetically installed after something like bzip2 in an upgrade, it would overtake potentially incompatible versions of libraries.  Not going to happen if you run a stable release, but as Urchlay said, on current it can pose a problem.
[06:56:35] <Urchlay> the other nice thing about the existence of aaa_elflibs: if you manage to screw up your /lib and/or /usr/lib dirs, you can mostly fix things just by reinstalling that one package
[06:56:51] <TommyC> Well, my physical machine is running -current.
[06:57:04] <Urchlay> (at least it'll get the system back to being able to boot & run. You'd still want to reinstall the actual library packages afterward)
[06:57:08] <TommyC> But aaa_elflibs is still from my 13.37 install. Should I upgrade?
[06:57:12] <Urchlay> nope
[06:57:42] <poprocks> quite frankly, I'm not sure what the purpose of that particular package is if you're running current.
[06:57:44] <Urchlay> the official word, last I checked, was "never ever upgrade aaa_elflibs"
[06:57:53] <TommyC> Even on stable systems?
[06:58:18] <Urchlay> on my 14 boxen, aaa_elflibs is from 13.37, doesn't cause any problems
[06:58:46] <poprocks> upgrading it on stable systems should work fine.  But going from one point release to the next without upgrading should also work fine, in theory
[06:59:53] <Urchlay> ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-14.0/slackware/a/aaa_elflibs-14.0-i486-4.txt
[07:00:04] <Urchlay> "should not be upgraded or reinstalled"
[07:00:28] <TommyC> My concern is when /usr/lib/foo.0.so in aaa_elflibs gets a new /usr/lib/foo.1.so from the official package
[07:00:40] <TommyC> Urchlay: doesn't say anything about removal. ^.^
[07:00:51] <Urchlay> I guess if you wanna nitpick, it's "should not", not "must not"... I dunno that Pat was speaking RFC-ese when he wrote that though.
[07:01:36] <Urchlay> TommyC: in most cases that won't be a problem, even if it happens. It'll waste a tiny bit of disk space, is all.

[07:04:11] <poprocks> Urchlay: heh, and you now have aaa_alflibs version 13.37?  You must have upgraded in a customized fashion without strictly following UPGRADE.TXT

[07:05:41] <poprocks> Urchlay: ah, touche ;-)  But you're now on your 4th iteration of vanilla Slackware
[07:06:16] <KaMii> Urchlay: you tried to upgrade from slamd to slackware?
[07:06:18] <Urchlay> yeah. Somewhere I screwed up.
[07:06:24] <Urchlay> KaMii: not "tried", I actually did (it worked)
[07:06:49] <KaMii> well it always seem like it would work in theory
[07:07:03] <KaMii> but i thought somewhere along the line something would segfault
[07:07:45] <Urchlay> I was honestly expecting it to fail (maybe in a way simple enough that I could fix it, or maybe I'd say screwit and install from scratch, either would have been OK with me)
[07:08:46] <KaMii> yea, so you did slackware 64 right or did you upgrade from slamd64 to slack 32 bit?
[07:08:57] <Urchlay> slamd to slackware64
[07:09:34] <Urchlay> I wanted 64-bit when I first got a 64-bit cpu, and slackware didn't have it yet, hence slamd
[07:10:09] <KaMii> you prefer 64 bit?
[07:10:18] <KaMii> i just hated messing with multilibs all the time
[07:10:19] <poprocks> I refuse to switch to an x86_64 OS until 64-bit processors are *so* ubiquitous that lib64 is gone for good
[07:10:33] <Urchlay> yah, I prefer 64
[07:10:54] <KaMii> you must not game much
[07:10:57] <Urchlay> although it's a preference, not backed by solid research or benchmarking or anything
[07:10:59] <Urchlay> I don't
[07:11:05] <poprocks> 32-bit Slackware flies on this machine and I'd be incredulous if anyone were to tell me 64-bit Slackware was *noticeably* better than what I'm running
[07:11:24] <doug713705> 64bits systems are better for systems with more than 4GB RAM
[07:11:35] <KaMii> i tried both 64 bit and 32 bit on the same machine, i noticed no performance difference
[07:11:37] <poprocks> well not *this* machine technically since I'm ssh'd into another slower 32-bit one, but you know what I mean ;-)
[07:11:44] <cmyster> poprocks: only on more then ~16gb mem maybe, but I'm also very fond of my 32b
[07:11:46] <Urchlay> though if I did, most of the game would probly have to run in wine, and wine 32-bit is easy to get running... especially with recent wine 1.5.x releases (no need for multilib, if your wine is new enough!)
[07:12:17] <KaMii> hrm, never tried a 64 bit wine compile
[07:12:42] <doug713705> compiled it yesterday, compiled like a charm
[07:12:57] <Urchlay> I only compile wine if the official wine slackware package won't work for some reason
[07:13:15] <Urchlay> (they're one of the few major projects that actually releases slack packages, might as well at least try to use them)
[07:13:17] <poprocks> There isn't an official Slackware pacakge
[07:13:24] <poprocks> oh, I see what you mean
[07:13:30] <Urchlay> eh, semi-official. It's linked to from their main site.
[07:13:35] <poprocks> Yeah.
[07:13:39] <Urchlay> (wine's site, I mean)
[07:14:09] <KaMii> wish they would just provide a slackbuild and not a binary
[07:14:32] <poprocks> I'm weird, I like to have pretty much any piece of software that isn't part of the official install come from slackbuilds.org... that way I know by looking at the SBo release tag where it comes from ;-)
[07:14:36] <Urchlay> usr/doc/wine-1.5.15/wine.SlackBuild
[07:14:37] <KaMii> or both, that way i can look over the slackbuild and decide if I want to waste my time compiling or just grab their binary
[07:14:52] <Urchlay> the SlackBuild is included inside the binary at least.
[07:14:53] <KaMii> oh, they do provide it in the package
[07:14:56] <doug713705> the link for slackware package on winehq.org does not give any slackware package !
[07:14:59] <KaMii> Urchlay: how does it look?
[07:15:08] <doug713705> That's why I compiled it from SBo
[07:15:12] <Urchlay> doug713705: does it not? It did, last I looked (months ago though)
[07:15:39] <doug713705> The link is here but it links to some source package, some .msi package or rpm one !
[07:15:43] <doug713705> no t?z
[07:15:57] <KaMii> .msi is windows
[07:16:02] <doug713705> I know
[07:16:14] <doug713705> Wine for Windows ?
[07:16:17] <doug713705> :-D
[07:16:31] <Urchlay> ehhh. That's the sourceforge auto-generated "download the latest version" link. Try drilling down into the actual subdirs (named after the version numbers)
[07:16:36] <Urchlay> http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/files/Slackware%20Packages/
[07:16:37] <KaMii> well, yea probably need it for some older apps
[07:16:59] <Urchlay> click 1.5.20, then x86_64 or i486, and ye shall find a .txz package
[07:17:26] <doug713705> sbopkg -i wine is easier :-)
[07:17:31] <Urchlay> takes longer
[07:18:05] <TommyC> Yeah, sbopkg will actually compile wine (and dependencies).
[07:18:10] <TommyC> winehq.org has a pre-built Slackware package.
[07:18:51] <doug713705> Yes but I was unable to find it (in fact Ijust followed the link but it goes nowhere interresting)
[07:18:55] <Urchlay> what?
[07:18:59] <TommyC> On a secondary note: Qemu does not like btrfs...
[07:19:04] <Urchlay> http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/files/Slackware%20Packages/1.5.20/x86_64/
[07:19:13] <Urchlay> you don't see a .txz package there?
[07:19:42] <poprocks> oh, I guess it does have a different release tag: "1sg".
[07:20:19] <Urchlay> TommyC: at this point in its development, btrfs is only for filesystem developers and the morbidly curious or suicidal. Which are you, again?
[07:20:21] <TommyC> Yep, by Simone Giusetti, hence "sg"
[07:20:31] <doug713705> I mean, the link to slack package on the winehq.org download page does not go to what it mention. Not a problem, you have found the package by yourself. I chose to compile it from SBo. That is the power of free software :-)
[07:20:32] <TommyC> Urchlay: morbidly curious ^_^
[07:20:47] <Urchlay> doug713705: huh? I got there by following the link on the winehq.org site.
[07:21:26] <Urchlay> doug713705: seriously, something must be wrong with your browser or something (or you're suffering from a bad case of the brainfarts, it happens to me too sometimes)
[07:21:32] <doug713705> may be the french page is not up to date
[07:21:37] <Urchlay> oh
[07:21:43] <Urchlay> I didn't even know there was a french page
[07:21:44] <KaMii> lol
[07:21:44] <doug713705> http://www.winehq.org/download/ This is the page
[07:22:13] <Urchlay> yeah. And "Download Slackware packages" takes me to http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/files/Slackware%20Packages/
[07:22:24] <doug713705> there's a link to txz package but it goes here : http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/files/Wine%20Gecko/1.9-beta1/
[07:22:29] MLanden (~MLanden@pool-108-26-97-249.nrflva.east.verizon.net) left irc: Quit: "Take care,all!!"
[07:22:36] <Urchlay> and on that page is one subdir for each wine version (1.5.20, 1.5.19, etc)
[07:22:45] <Urchlay> huh?
[07:23:22] <Urchlay> there is something screwy going on, in that case. 'Cause I'm following the same links as you are, but I get to the packages and you don't. Wonder why.
[07:23:35] <TommyC> Urchlay: a/ seems to be installing ok so far without aaa_elflibs.
[07:23:42] <doug713705> that's the french page :-)
[07:23:56] <doug713705> Note that I never asked for a french page
[07:23:59] <Urchlay> I didn't see a french page. I followed the link you pasted in here, and it was in English
[07:24:28] <KaMii> maybe he has google translate working
[07:24:30] <Urchlay> what are you doing, using tor or something?
[07:24:39] <doug713705> I think the language is guessed from browser prefs
[07:24:51] <KaMii> your browser is probably translating
[07:24:54] <doug713705> no, seamonkey, slackware official package
[07:24:59] <Urchlay> I really really hate when URLs aren't actually universal
[07:25:10] <doug713705> no, I have strictly no plugins
[07:25:11] <Urchlay> (that's what the U is supposed to stand for...)
[07:25:18] <Urchlay> I'm using firefox, not seamonkey
[07:25:28] <Urchlay> but that should'nt matter. The same page works fine in links.
[07:25:42] <KaMii> Urchlay: everyone got all philisopical and now universal doesnt mean shit anymore
[07:25:58] <KaMii> because, oh yea, now we have a multiverse theory so you can take your universe and shove it
[07:26:10] <Urchlay> wait. No it does *not* work in links. I get sent to the wine gecko sourceforge page, same as you do.
[07:26:13] <Urchlay> WTF?
[07:26:39] <Urchlay> ah!
[07:27:04] <Urchlay> Don't click on the Slackware icon (or its link, if you're using links)
[07:27:25] <KaMii> bad link?
[07:27:26] <Urchlay> the correct link is the text, to the right, that says "Download Slackware Packages"
[07:27:45] <KaMii> hrm, time to email the webmaster
[07:28:13] <doug713705> here is the source code part with the slack package link : http://pastebin.com/GgbgkVNR
[07:28:24] <doug713705> (french version)
[07:28:32] <Urchlay> yeah. For all the other links, the icon links to the same place as the text link. Only the Slackware one has different links
[07:28:45] <KaMii> hahaha
[07:28:55] <KaMii> i wonder if thats just a sick joke on their part
[07:29:07] <KaMii> (if they are a true slacker, they will find it)
[07:29:10] <Urchlay> doug713705: OK, in the french version, both links are the same (and they're both the wrong one)
[07:29:17] <poprocks> lol
[07:29:19] <XGizzmo> I think we should DDoS them.
[07:29:24] <KaMii> hahaha
[07:29:25] <doug713705> lol !
[07:29:33] <Urchlay> I think I'll just send 'em a polite email
[07:29:44] <poprocks> they're probably using bind4
[07:29:50] <KaMii> Urchlay: does the title say, wtf are you assholes thinking?
[07:30:04] <Urchlay> poprocks: it's not a DNS issue, it's a just plain wrong URL
[07:30:07] <Urchlay> in the page source
[07:30:23] <TommyC> Maybe they were compromised?
[07:30:24] <KaMii> so now we know that Urchlay never clicks on picture links
[07:30:40] <Urchlay> the email may get ignored because they want me to use their web forum or web bugtracker or something. In which case they can just ignore me.
[07:31:00] Disorganized (~Disorgani@c-24-7-60-25.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) left irc: Quit: Disorganized

[07:31:17] <Urchlay> KaMii: the text link probably happened to be closer to wherever my mouse pointer happened to be
[07:31:50] <KaMii> Urchlay: you strike me as a tty only type
[07:32:10] <Urchlay> although I still have the habit of eyeballing the bar at the bottom that shows where a link will take you, so I might have noticed the difference in the links (but didn't)
[07:32:15] <KaMii> but you probably just use kde
[07:32:26] <Urchlay> nah, I run X almost all the time... so I can have lots of ttys at once :)
[07:32:31] <KaMii> thats why i stopped using ff, they got rid of that bottom bar
[07:32:38] <Urchlay> eh? mine has it
[07:32:44] <TommyC> ?
[07:32:45] <Urchlay> I'd quit using it too, if it went away
[07:32:46] <TommyC> Mine has it too.
[07:32:47] <KaMii> well like a year ago they ditched it
[07:32:50] <KaMii> so i quit using ff
[07:32:54] <Urchlay> which ff version was this?
[07:32:56] <TommyC> If they did ditch it a year ago, it's back.
[07:33:00] <KaMii> i forget, whatever it was a year ago
[07:33:07] <KaMii> 4 i think
[07:33:08] <Urchlay> (I haven't updated mine in a while, it might be over a year old)

[07:33:30] <KaMii> well idk i stopped using ff a long time ago
[07:33:35] <Urchlay> btw, no, I don't use kde
[07:33:42] <KaMii> i3wm?
[07:33:46] <Urchlay> windowmaker
[07:33:50] <KaMii> close enough
[07:33:52] <KaMii> lol
[07:34:10] <KaMii> well at some point they got rid of the bottom bar and i just switched to chromium
[07:34:14] <Urchlay> I don't like the whole concept of "desktop environment" like kde or xfce does
[07:34:25] ninjak (~ninjak@77.239.137.142) joined ##slackware.
[07:34:30] <KaMii> i like my xfce
[07:34:42] <Urchlay> KaMii: the bottom bar is there. Possibly you mangled your config somehow and made it go away...
[07:34:59] <KaMii> no, it was gone from every system
[07:35:00] mikef (~mikef@41.81.198.62) joined ##slackware.
[07:35:07] <KaMii> and it was on their forums too
[07:35:12] <KaMii> someone had to make an addon to get it back
[07:35:17] <Urchlay> say what?
[07:35:20] <Urchlay> link?
[07:35:25] <doug713705> I liked XFCE but it became to be too much heavy (I did _not_ say bloated). No I use openbox. Very light and easy config
[07:35:31] <KaMii> i cant remember, it was a long time ago
[07:35:36] <KaMii> maybe they put it back in since then
[07:35:50] <TommyC> They probably did, because it's on my firefox.
[07:36:03] <KaMii> doug713705: i have never heard of xfce being called heavy before
[07:36:09] <Urchlay> ah, that:  http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-happened-status-bar
[07:36:15] <KaMii> Urchlay: yes
[07:36:23] <Urchlay> TommyC: does it only appear when you mouseover a link? that's what the article says
[07:36:30] <doug713705> KaMii: I never thought xfce was heavy befor trying openbox ;-)
[07:36:41] <TommyC> Urchlay: Yes'm.
[07:36:45] <TommyC> But pictures count.
[07:37:10] <Urchlay> ok, in that case, yours behaves the same as mine
[07:37:28] <Urchlay> I don't count that as "it's gone", I just thought of it as "it's only visible when it needs to be"
[07:38:04] <KaMii> well when it first happened, it was gone totally
[07:38:09] <Urchlay> mildly annoying, but only mildly (anytime the UI changes on an app I use constantly, it's annoying... especially pointless changes that don't actually add any features)
[07:38:37] Oak__ (~Oak@139.190.32.18) left irc: Read error: Connection reset by peer

[07:40:25] <Urchlay> the other day was trying to figure out how to do something on a browser on a mac... and cussing about "damn safari"... until someone pointed out that I was actually using firefox
[07:40:56] <Urchlay> (it's not safari that's annoying, it's the mac UI, I guess)
[07:41:01] <KaMii> lol

[07:42:54] <Urchlay> yeah
[07:43:40] <KaMii> i bet the next version will be OSX Hello Kitty
[07:43:50] <KaMii> since they always use felines as their os names
[07:43:58] tuxdev_ (~tim@unaffiliated/tuxdev) joined ##slackware.

[07:44:21] <TommyC> After their expected versions that is.
[07:44:21] <doug713705> should be nice :-) Windows playskool and mac osx hello kitty, that's make sense !
[07:44:37] <TommyC> "Raring Ringtail" is what 13.04 is supposed to be named.

[07:53:34] <Urchlay> I guess they wouldn't use anything as cool as Rocky Raccoon
[07:54:52] <Urchlay> I got really annoyed with that mac for another reason... I kept reading docs that said "download this package for snow leopard, or this one for tiger" etc... and the "about this macintosh" just shows the version number, not the cat-name, so I had to actually do a damn google search to find out the stupid cat name
[07:55:40] <ventYl> cat-names irritate me too
[07:55:55] <Urchlay> to me, that's completely stupid. Encourage everyone to refer to it by your l33t name to make them feel like insiders, but don't put the name anywhere obvious in the UI
[07:56:03] <Urchlay> to put noobs in their place
[07:57:13] <ventYl> the only thing they are good for is that if next OS X version is just added prefix for old version name it means that next version is just there we fixed it and more or less has nothing significantly new
[07:57:32] <Urchlay> oh, is that why there's regular leopard and snow leopard?
[07:57:45] <Urchlay> version numbers could do that, too. 10.3 and 10.3.1 or such.
[07:57:47] <ventYl> yep. and lion and mountain lion
[07:58:42] <Urchlay> pretty obvious that 10.3.1 is 10.3 with minor changes/fixes, without making up a name out of thin air
[07:58:45] <ventYl> but they are 10.5 and 10.6 ;) or 10.7 and 10.8
[07:58:50] <Urchlay> that's dumb
[07:59:11] <Crosma> The names are just for fun, really.
[07:59:19] <Urchlay> wonder if there'll ever be an 11, and if so, will it still be called OS X (with a roman numeral for 10 still)
[07:59:24] <ventYl> two significant differences between 10.5 and 10.6 are that 10.6 is x86_64 and has no ppc version
[07:59:51] <Urchlay> Crosma: maybe. Except that the practice of using the names confuses the hell out of someone who isn't steeped in the culture.

[08:00:25] <Urchlay> my friend think I must be good at fixing her mac because "you use that linux thing, that's unix, same as a mac!"
[08:01:04] <Crosma> 10.7 uses 64-bit kernel on all 64-bit hardware (10.6 only did with the server version), and 10.8 has no 32-bit kernel.

[08:01:19] <Urchlay> they're dropping old hardware pretty fast
[08:02:27] <Urchlay> and I dunno if this is really apple's fault, but it seems like every time a new OSX version is released, 6 months later every piece of open source software seems to require the new version
[08:02:39] <Crosma> OSX isn't that different to Linux from an arch point of view. OSX just has a proprietary GUI.
[08:03:15] <Urchlay> yeah, I know, darwin's basically a BSD userland + a mach kernel + mach unix server (wrapper, shim, whatever the correct term is)
[08:03:23] <ventYl> Urchlay: if you realize that virtually all macs since maybe 2007 are 64bit capable it isn't that horrible
[08:03:46] <Crosma> The SDKs only go back to the previous version. So I can only compile for Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8) on Mountain Lion. However, you can manually install the earlier SDKs.
[08:03:56] <Crosma> However, there's no PPC compiler in OSX any more.
[08:04:18] <Urchlay> but no amount of knowledge about slackware or freebsd is going to help me troubleshoot her broken "app store" application. It doesn't work, doesn't give an error, I don't practice santeria, I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't tell her what's wrong
[08:04:44] <Crosma> I've got all the stuff for compiling for Snow Leopard (10.6) on my Mountain Lion install of OSX.
[08:05:12] <Urchlay> the upgrade from one point release to the next still costs some money, doesn't it?
[08:05:17] <ventYl> another reason why to build on leopard
[08:05:24] <ikla_> is this #osx
[08:05:26] <ikla_> jesus
[08:05:32] <ventYl> Urchlay: yep
[08:05:49] <Urchlay> ikla_: this is me being bored. Don't like it, say something on-topic and we'll talk about that instead :)
[08:05:58] <Crosma> I'd build on Leopard if I was going to do a commercial release of something. I don't believe in only supporting the latest OS versions.

[08:06:54] <Urchlay> ventYl: that's pretty obnoxious. They do a point release what, every year, and drop support after what, 2 years? for a commercial product the user paid good money for?
[08:06:57] <ikla_> :)
[08:07:24] <KaMii> at least their os is cheap
[08:07:29] <KaMii> compared to microsoft
[08:07:32] <Urchlay> yeah, but their hardware ain't
[08:07:45] <KaMii> yea, because they know, thats where they get you
[08:07:50] <ventYl> Urchlay: i recently applied security patches for 10.5 which were released in 2011 so you can count with up to 6 year limited support
[08:07:54] <ikla_> their hardware is a rip in your (_._)
[08:07:57] <ikla_> $
[08:08:01] <Urchlay> any OS should be free and open source anyway.
[08:08:08] <KaMii> i agree
[08:08:28] <Urchlay> ventYl: support in the sense of security patches? that's a lot better than nothing
[08:08:29] <KaMii> i dont mind paying for hardware
[08:08:59] <Urchlay> but support as in developers still release stuff that runs on that OS seems not to be a priority...?
[08:09:06] <ikla_> you can get much better hardware and toss windoze on it and you have a better all around desktop
[08:09:21] <Urchlay> heh. I hate windows pretty bad too.
[08:09:35] <ventYl> Urchlay: in fact they totally dropped whole PPC hardware line support just recently. until maybe last year most of apple SW had also PPC version
[08:09:45] <ikla_> hate it or not it still the top OS out there
[08:09:46] <Crosma> OSX is *nix, and Windows is poo.
[08:09:56] <Urchlay> though if it's still possible to have windows 7 or 8 use the same UI as win2k or so, I'd be able to use it without too much hair-pulling
[08:10:03] <ikla_> OSX is a twisted piece of *nix
[08:10:43] <Urchlay> I really don't give a damn about populatity. Justin Beiber is more popular than Steely Dan, doesn't mean he makes better music
[08:10:49] <Crosma> I use a virtualised Win2k for running Windows stuff mostly. :P
[08:10:59] <ikla_> somewhere down below this pretty gui is really unix!~!@# so osx roolz!
[08:11:07] <ventYl> and i bet it runs faster than on real hardware :)
[08:11:18] <Crosma> I use OSX' *nix features pretty heavily.
[08:11:31] <ikla_> love or hate windows it still offers the best desktop experience
[08:11:41] <ikla_> more software support, gaming etc.
[08:12:03] <Crosma> I don't find that using Linux or OSX restricts my gaming. /me shrugs
[08:12:07] <doug713705> more software ?
[08:12:37] <Crosma> I only really use open source stuff ignoring games.
[08:12:37] <Urchlay> ikla_: the phrase "the best desktop experience" carries some hidden assumptions. Like, what's best for one person will be best for everyone. Or, that I even want a "desktop" (does windows 3.1 count as a "desktop"? How about windowmaker? Anything more complicated than that is annoying to me)
[08:13:12] <ikla_> Urchlay, of course people are going to disagree with that in the Linux community
[08:13:27] <ikla_> all ppl know is windows out there
[08:13:33] <Urchlay> I disagreed with it when I was using win95 and didn't even know about linux yet
[08:13:35] <ikla_> and people are comfortable with it
[08:14:00] <Urchlay> (actually I wanted to kill my roommate who decided to "helpfully" upgrade my win3.1 box to win95 while I was at work one day)
[08:14:13] <ikla_> 3.1 to win95
[08:14:15] <ikla_> those were the days
[08:14:21] <Crosma> You have to count iOS and Android now.
[08:14:26] <Crosma> They're hideously popular.
[08:14:40] <ikla_> oh and building gnome daily from source
[08:14:42] <ikla_> :/
[08:14:51] <Urchlay> he didn't read the system requirements. It either said it required or maybe just "strongly recommended" 8MB of RAM... I had 4
[08:15:06] <Urchlay> it literally never stopped swapping, from bootup to shutdown
[08:15:08] <KaMii> Urchlay: is he still alive today?
[08:15:23] <Urchlay> yeah, I don't kill everyone I want to kill. I'm lazy.
[08:15:24] <ventYl> ikla_: i think that "best desktop experience" reputation of windows is based only on fact that people are used to it
[08:15:41] <Urchlay> too lazy to even carry a grudge, I'm not even mad 10 minutes later, usually
[08:15:41] <Crosma> But Windows 8 is a horrible experience.
[08:15:41] <ikla_> ventYl, that's a big part of it
[08:15:50] <ikla_> who wants to develop software for linux?
[08:15:54] <Urchlay> I do
[08:16:06] <Crosma> I develop for Linux exclusively. :P
[08:16:23] <ikla_> everyone wants to have the next best distro or next best DE/WM
[08:16:33] <ventYl> ikla_: i don't mean developers. i mean regular users. developers are just their tails. nobody wants to develop for platform which nobody uses
[08:16:53] <ikla_> ventYl, true and one that doesn't have a standard
[08:17:41] <doug713705> unix is plenty of standards
[08:17:58] <ikla_> really
[08:18:09] <Urchlay> I miss the good old days, when "regular user" generally meant "smart enough to write code in BASIC or Pascal, but hasn't learn assembly yet"
[08:18:10] <ventYl> ikla_: in my opinion standard base in unix is better and more consistent than '
[08:18:19] <ventYl> "standards" in windows world
[08:18:49] <ikla_> how many distros are out there now?
[08:18:52] <Urchlay> anyone you met on a 300 baud BBS had to at least be smart enough to know what a modem was and how to set one up and use it
[08:19:09] <ikla_> how many support different drivers, version of software etc. ?
[08:19:16] <Urchlay> (didn't stop some of them from being illiterate slobs, but the signal/noise ratio was much higher back then)
[08:19:44] <Urchlay> ...and I might as well be saying "Get off my lawn, ya hooligans!", at this point
[08:19:59] <ventYl> ikla_: but back to regular users. i know several of them who first met with linux boxes which were sold as contract hardware for 3G internet and they hate windows look and feel till now
[08:20:11] <doug713705> ikla_: on every distribution you can install what you want. even things that are not approved by your distro
[08:20:41] <KaMii> yea. i put pam on slackware
[08:20:48] <Crosma> On OSX you can do whatever you want, and it's annoying that people who I know who've never used OSX keep telling me otherwise.
[08:20:55] <ikla_> doug, why do we need hundreds of distros in the linux communuity?
[08:21:14] <KaMii> because someone decides to fork a distribution
[08:21:19] <ventYl> ikla_: funny thing is that most of drivers doesn't need any maintenance in terms of "installing" and "configuring"
[08:21:23] <ventYl> they just works
[08:21:33] <ventYl> or simply does not :))
[08:21:38] <ikla_> vent, 60-70% maybe
[08:21:44] <doug713705> because "Without freedom of choice there is no creativity" (cpt Kirk)
[08:21:49] <Crosma> There aren't many serious distros though.
[08:22:04] <Crosma> Slackware, Arch, Fedora, CentOS/RHEL, Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE.
[08:22:09] <Urchlay> KaMii: did you actually pam-ify the whole system? rebuild everything that's capable of being built with pam?
[08:22:11] <Crosma> Mint, I guess.
[08:22:25] <ikla_> every application that is aimed towards something has 5-10 projects out there
[08:22:33] <ikla_> or someone forks someone elses
[08:22:35] <Urchlay> ikla_: same reason we have hundreds of species in nature? (not that I really know the answer to that either)
[08:22:46] <ikla_> so much duplicate effort and time getting wasted
[08:22:48] <Crosma> There are way more than hundreds.
[08:22:54] <Crosma> There's like a thousands different species of ant.
[08:22:57] <ikla_> Crosma, prolly thousands
[08:22:58] <ikla_> yeah
[08:23:03] <ventYl> ikla_: days when most of hardware was pita to get working are mostly history
[08:23:17] <KaMii> Urchlay: i only rebuilt what i wanted
[08:23:19] <ikla_> vent, I disagree
[08:23:29] <doug713705> ikla_: do you really want to own the same car, house, wife as your neighbourg ?
[08:23:38] <Urchlay> "one size fits all" doesn't even work for something as simple as baby diapers, why would it apply to OSes?
[08:23:48] <KaMii> but then when I realized that truecrypt wasnt opensource, I abanonded my project
[08:23:53] <ventYl> ACPI is big issue still probably
[08:24:11] <ventYl> throught not as big as it used to be
[08:25:01] <Crosma> ACPI used to cause all sorts of problems for me with Linux.
[08:25:05] <Crosma> Doesn't seem to any more.
[08:25:20] <ventYl> nor for me
[08:25:26] <ventYl> since i switched to mac :)))))
[08:25:35] <Urchlay> acpi on paper seems OK (it's supposed to be a standard), but so many implementations are broken... the only reason it works in linux now is that there are all sorts of workarounds and hacks in the kernel to support the various broken BIOSes
[08:26:00] <Urchlay> ventYl: mac hardware and their OS too, or do you boot slackware on it also?
[08:26:02] <ikla_> what I'm trying to say is every distro has different version of every package
[08:26:12] <ikla_> so this works on this distro and not on the other etc.
[08:26:25] <ikla_> or it relies on this lib and that version of that lib
[08:26:30] <Crosma> Linus has a good attitude that the kernel should make sure stuff works, not bitch that other hardware/software is wrong.
[08:26:51] <ikla_> at the end of the day Linux is just a kernel
[08:26:53] <ikla_> :p
[08:27:02] <ventYl> ikla_: usually different distros released in same time have quite similar versions of packages which depends
[08:27:06] <ikla_> all the b.s. around it is a mess
[08:27:35] <ventYl> Urchlay: i have OS X installed somewhere on external hard drive which i never attached since i've installed it
[08:27:48] <ikla_> ventYl, debian stable? centos? rhel?
[08:27:50] <Urchlay> Crosma: anyone writing code to support hardware that claims to support a standard, but doesn't really, has a right to grumble some (and then sit down & write code to make it work anyway, if they're serious about what they're doing)
[08:27:59] <ikla_> most of those are on ancient kernels and software
[08:28:15] <ventYl> ikla_: but their software versions are quite similar yet still ancient :P
[08:28:36] <Urchlay> nothing wrong with ancient software, if it works & has any security holes patched.
[08:28:59] <Urchlay> though I personally wouldn't want to run something like debian stable myself
[08:28:59] <Crosma> As long as they're being updated by the admin, Urchlay.
[08:29:08] <ikla_> real software vendors don't want to support 10000 distros
[08:29:17] <ikla_> or write drivers for a 10000 distros
[08:29:20] <Crosma> A lot of Linux servers with ancient software out there.
[08:29:21] <Urchlay> most of them don't want to even support *one* distro
[08:29:21] <ventYl> they doesn't have to :)
[08:29:35] <ikla_> see where I'm getting at?
[08:29:37] <ikla_> :)
[08:29:50] <ventYl> because most of time (except when you write package manager or something similar) you don't write code "for distro"
[08:30:06] <Urchlay> and, you don't write drivers for 10000 distros. You write drivers for the kernel (and if you're smart, you get your driver in-tree, so it gets updated for new module APIs when they happen)
[08:30:39] <ikla_> then when they support a distro and yum update or a apt-get upgrade breaks their app
[08:30:46] <ikla_> Urch, what about blob drivers?
[08:31:23] <Urchlay> blob drivers suck... but even those can be done e.g. the way nvidia does theirs (kernel API wrapper layer that you compile, which knows how to call the functions inside your blob)
[08:31:29] <ventYl> good blob drivers are distro independent too
[08:31:47] <Urchlay> nvidia's blob driver is about as good as it can be while still remaining a blob
[08:31:56] <ikla_> nvidia driver is pretty good I agree
[08:32:11] <Urchlay> (and I admit I'm biased: I think hardware drivers should always be open source, which obviously not everyone agrees with)
[08:32:14] <Crosma> ATi's drivers are terrible.
[08:32:32] <ikla_> Urch, that's how everyone thinks in this lovely community :)
[08:32:41] <ikla_> oh yeah, ATI is horrid
[08:32:59] <Urchlay> nvidia doesn't have to support e.g. slackware. The slackware community itself does that, for nvidia's drivers (slackbuilds.org nvidia builds work great)
[08:33:18] <Crosma> You can download and install the blob from nvidia.com in Slackware. Works fine.
[08:33:34] <ventYl> actually that's what i do all the time
[08:33:38] <ikla_> you can download blob from nvidia and it works fine on any distro
[08:33:50] <Urchlay> ikla_: well, I'm not one of those "I refuse to use closed source at all" types. I prefer open source, but will use closed if it's all that's available
[08:33:51] <ikla_> that has the required tools :)
[08:34:08] <ikla_> Urch, sometimes you don't have a choice and the blob driver is much better
[08:34:17] <Urchlay> every distro has the required tools (make, gcc, kernel source, bash, etc)
[08:34:30] <Urchlay> maybe the tools aren't installed by default, but they're there
[08:34:41] <ikla_> any of you familiar with the OFED stack? :)
[08:34:52] <Urchlay> ikla_: I just said I'd use closed, if it's all that's available.
[08:35:22] <Urchlay> although for my nvidia card, nouveau does everything I need it to (I play no games newer than about 1999 anyway)
[08:35:55] <Urchlay> if I were trying to play games made this century, nouveau would get replaced with the blob pretty quick
[08:36:11] <ikla_> yeah but the nvidia-settings control center or whatever is nice
[08:36:27] <ikla_> takes seconds to tweak things
[08:39:19] <ikla_> it will be interesting to see where Linux goes in the next 5 years, maybe someone will get the kernel booting on their vibrator

[08:41:01] <Urchlay> anyway, if someone does... it'll turn out NetBSD has been able to boot on that vibrator since 2003
[08:41:11] <ikla_> yup
[08:41:43] <Urchlay> ergh. Straight Jägermeister is kinda nasty.
[08:41:58] <Crosma> It is nasty, period.
[08:42:05] <ikla_> yup
[08:42:06] <Crosma> I think they make it out of period.

[08:42:22] <Urchlay> usually I'm drinking it mixed with something like redbull, which tastes even worse, so I don't notice
[08:42:39] <Urchlay> but, the point of drinking it right now is to get to sleep before 5AM, so no red bull
[08:42:42] <ikla_> it's not bad with red bull
[08:43:14] <Urchlay> jager + redbull still tastes pretty bad, but I like its effect (sorta like a mild form of speedballing)
[08:43:27] <Urchlay> or like drinking irish coffee
[08:43:51] <Urchlay> (except irish coffee can taste good... though it usually doesn't, at bars)
[08:44:16] <ikla_> what os
[08:44:23] <ikla_> does everyone pretty much run here other than slack
[08:44:23] <ikla_> :P

[08:46:11] <Urchlay> right now I'm only running slack
[08:46:13] Calle__Lid (~Calle_Lid@h-111-52.a323.priv.bahnhof.se) left ##slackware.
[08:46:42] <Urchlay> used to have some old sun boxes running a mix of solaris and netbsd (for messing around with and learning, not any useful purpose really)
[08:47:01] <Urchlay> and at one point my old laptop ran openbsd (poorly)
[08:47:47] <Urchlay> oh, and this time last year I was messing with netbsd/sparc in a qemu VM, trying to port some old DOS-centric code to it (mostly successful)
[08:49:36] <Crosma> Anyone got any non-x86 versions of Windows running emulated?
[08:49:46] <Crosma> Like PPC/Alpha/SPARC?
[08:50:55] <Master-Passeli> Windows sparc version?
[08:51:23] <Master-Passeli> is there such a version of windows?
[08:51:39] <Crosma> Yes.
[08:51:55] <Crosma> Windows 2000 release candidates were available for SPARC.
[08:52:03] <Master-Passeli> oh
[08:53:19] <Master-Passeli> imho those old forgotten beasts should remain sleeping and should not be named ever again ;)
[08:55:16] <Urchlay> hm. email about bad link on winehq download link sent to wine-users@winehq.org. Wonder if it'll bounce because I'm not on that list.
[08:56:06] <Urchlay> Crosma: I've got an old alpha with windows NT installed on it... it won't boot up to a usable system though (can't remember why not)
[08:56:38] <Urchlay> wanted to run tru64 on it, or maybe openvms, but never got around to actually doing anything with it at all
[08:57:16] <Urchlay> I did used to run internet explorer for solaris, on one of my sparcs that ran solaris 7

[09:04:09] <doug713705> something like 12 years here
[09:05:18] <Urchlay> since 1996
[09:08:00] <ikla_> never moved to another distro? hehehe
[09:08:26] <Urchlay> yeah, I ran a few different ones at various times
[09:08:45] <Urchlay> used to dual-boot slack and redhat (probably 5.0 or 5.1 or thereabouts)
[09:09:08] <Urchlay> and worked in a place where there were maybe 30 linux boxes running 20 different distros
[09:09:28] <Urchlay> so got exposure to all the major ones (this was in 1999/2000)

[09:10:18] <Urchlay> "Install linux on this piece of crap and make it run sendmail"
[09:10:51] <Urchlay> it might end up running mandrake, suse, debian... you didn't tell the guy what to install so he picks what he likes

[09:12:03] <Urchlay> during that time period I got really good at using vi, it was the only editor guaranteed to be installed on everything (which wouldn't be true today, in an environment like that, I guess)
[09:12:25] <ikla_> yeah
[09:12:35] kpreston (~kpreston@68.200.91.57) joined ##slackware.

[09:13:08] <Urchlay> (but only vim, not elvis or nvi... yuck)
[09:13:13] <ikla_> yeah vi/vim is pretty much installed on anything these days
[09:13:30] <Urchlay> actually I think it's not, on a default install of ubuntu
[09:13:58] <Urchlay> there's a noobuntu box in the living room here (belongs to someone else, I rent a room from them)
[09:14:21] <Urchlay> IIRC the only non-gui editor installed by default was ae
[09:14:33] <ikla_> did you do anything to it?
[09:15:09] <Urchlay> yeah, I had to install vim, for when I have to edit conf file (the owners know nothing about sysadm)

[09:25:05] <KaMii> the movies suck
[09:25:21] <Urchlay> yeah, the book is great, and so is damn near everything else Heinlein wrote
[09:25:27] <KaMii> i saw the first children of the corn

[09:25:37] <KaMii> never saw the others
[09:25:50] <KaMii> heinlein was a good author
[09:25:55] <Urchlay> check out "the moon is a harsh mistress" sometime. It would have made a great movie, if they'd made it in the 80s
[09:25:58] <KaMii> whoever made these movies, should be shot
[09:26:07] <KaMii> wukong: i already read it
[09:26:14] <Urchlay> well, and if they didn't give it the starship troopers treatment
[09:26:43] <KaMii> 2001 was a good book, the movie well its good in its cult classic sort of way
[09:26:49] <Urchlay> (let a liberal director make a movie of a book written by a conservative author... you get a mess. The same would be true the other way around.)
[09:27:34] <Urchlay> actually heinlein never changed his political stance... in the 1950s he was considered liberal/radical, in the 80s he was considered conservative
[09:27:54] <Urchlay> 2001 is a good movie. The sequel is OK too (not as good)
[09:28:08] <KaMii> the sequal sucked
[09:28:10] <Cultist> not sure how someone could read Stranger In a Strange Land and think that the author isn't liberal

[09:34:03] <KaMii> omfg they just stole from Battlestar galactica
[09:34:07] <KaMii> they even used the same line
[09:34:37] <KaMii> Urchlay: american liberal or european liberal?
[09:35:28] <Urchlay> actually "liberal" and "conservative" are stereotypes, they don't describe anyone's actual politics any more than "white" and "black" describe anyone's actual ancestry
[09:36:10] <KaMii> in europe liberal has a different meaning
[09:36:17] <Urchlay> KaMii: European swallow. African swallows are, of course, non-migratory.

[09:38:41] <Urchlay> not necessarily
[09:38:43] <Cultist> once the blood starts mixing in with the rum
[09:38:55] <Urchlay> red puke might just mean you ate red jelly beans or M&Ms

[09:43:54] <Cultist> just like nature intended.
[09:44:22] <KaMii> ok...
[09:44:43] <Cultist> I'm a cocktail person.
[09:44:48] <Cultist> not very discriminating about it though.

[12:07:33] <Crosma> You can run Linux whatever on them, and it works as a phone. It's a bit of an immature platform though.
[12:07:36] <shonudo> osh... the next frontier

[12:34:27] <shonudo> samsung and apple i think
[12:34:42] <ruskie> nokia had 40% market share
[12:34:43] <shonudo> those are the two leaders, and in that order i think
[12:34:59] <shonudo> easy enough to google and see if samsung is ahead of apple
[12:35:43] <ruskie> 2011 nokia was 23% global

[17:13:37] <Urchlay> eh? for prebuilt packages (like the official ones), he doesn't need a slackbuild, just the .tgz or .txz package
[17:14:01] <usuario> or I should better upgrade to -current instead

[17:14:51] <Urchlay> right now the only difference between stable and current seems to be the kernel and gcc.
[17:15:13] <alisonken1home> Urchlay: a couple of other things too, but that's the main thing
[17:15:17] <Urchlay> (gcc is a point release newer, 4.7.2 vs. 4.7.1, not sure it changes much)
[17:15:20] <usuario> I had to upgrade the kernel due to a bug
[17:15:45] <Urchlay> what bug?
[17:15:51] <LTF> solved with removepkg, thnx
[17:15:59] <Urchlay> LTF: beware
[17:16:39] <Urchlay> LTF: anything in slackware that uses gnutls will need to be rebuilt against the older version, after you get it installed
[17:16:56] <Skywise> oh man is that a pain
[17:17:15] <alisonken1home> LTF: any particular reason you want to downgrade the gnutls package?
[17:17:24] <Skywise> thats why i never update gcc
[17:17:46] <Urchlay> gnutls is one of those library packages where the DSO major version changes with every release. Your binaries will be looking for libgnutls.so.28, but you'll actually have libgnutls.so.27 or older
[17:17:46] <Skywise> just do a fresh install, its too convoluted
[17:17:54] <Skywise> yeah
[17:18:04] <usuario> I believe it had to do wwith intel hd2000 gpu interrupts
[17:18:09] <LTF> alisonken1home: yes, the current version is not compatible with openvas 5
[17:18:14] <LTF> Urchlay: thank u
[17:18:19] <Urchlay> eh? upgrading gcc shouldn't require recompiling anything (it's the compiler, not used at runtime)
[17:18:50] <LTF> Urchlay:  is there a way to remove or uninstall an .slackbuild
[17:19:07] <Nh3xus> modding stuff like gcc is always a pain because it's a part of a tool chain
[17:19:22] <alisonken1home> LTF: the .slackbuild file can be rm'ed - it's just a bash script for building the package
[17:19:46] <Urchlay> a .SlackBuild isn't a package by itself. You can't install or uninstall it, all you can do with it is build a package from it
[17:20:15] <LTF> alisonken1home: so how i delete a program built with an ./slackbuild ?, i ran ./openvas-libraries.Slackbuild , and I want to remove these old libraries
[17:20:49] <LTF> removepkg did not work
[17:21:12] <alisonken1home> LTF: .slackbuild -> build package - installpkg <package> -> installs program
[17:21:15] <Urchlay> "OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System,[1] initially GNessUs) is a framework of several services and tools offering a vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management solution."... a security application that makes you revert to an old (probably known insecure) version of a security-related package (gnutls), probably isn't worth using

[17:32:08] <Skywise> thats just insane
[17:32:29] <P4C0> price?

[17:32:39] <Skywise> $100
[17:32:54] <Skywise> runs android by default
[17:33:47] <Skywise> its got an hdmi port on one side and usb on the other
[17:34:07] <Urchlay> I have been told (by someone in this channel) that the pi can't actually decode video fast enough to fill up those 1080p pixels at full frame rate
[17:34:10] <Skywise> and a microsd card slot
[17:34:26] <Skywise> if you pay the license it can
[17:34:38] <Urchlay> all video codecs, or just x264?
[17:34:50] <Skywise> its got a dedicated gpu that the licsense unlocks
[17:35:02] <Skywise> otherwise you get software decoding and that might be an issue
[17:35:22] Nick change: Space_ -> SpaceA
[17:35:27] <P4C0> how much cost the license?
[17:35:33] <Skywise> $3
[17:35:42] <Urchlay> also, even with "unlocked" gpu, can anything on Slackware actually *use* it?
[17:35:48] <Nh3xus> I've found this for the licenses : http://www.raspberrypi.com/license-keys/
[17:35:55] <Skywise> yeah, i would think so
[17:36:10] <Urchlay> (or does it need whatever player it ships with, which would have software support for the dedicated hardware?)
[17:36:19] <Skywise> i would expect to use armed slack on it
[17:36:38] <Skywise> i think it does have a custom toolchain, just like the other arm cpus do
[17:37:12] <Urchlay> yeah, armed slack works. But I wonder if, when you pay your $3 and get your license key, the mplayer or whatever that comes with armedslack is smart enough to take advantage of the now-unlocked gpu
[17:37:28] <Urchlay> like any other piece of hardware, it would need a driver
[17:37:29] <Skywise> yeah, i think thats in the codec

[17:50:32] <pprkut> access to the hardware decoder is provided over the openmax API
[17:50:37] <Skywise> its supported by xmbc it says, so i would expect it to be used by all
[17:51:00] wrod (~wrodrigue@triband-mum-120.61.52.98.mtnl.net.in) joined ##slackware.
[17:51:15] <Skywise> but i'm no rpi salesman
[17:51:38] <Urchlay> "This will allow you to play MPEG-2 material from XBMC and omxplayer, which hasnt been an available feature before now."... but it almost certainly means "the xbmc that we provide in the OS that we provide", not "the xbmc you compile yourself from a slackbuild"
[17:51:55] <Urchlay> I'm prepared to be wrong... I hope I'm wrong actually
[17:52:24] <Skywise> do they provide xmbc?
[17:52:36] <Urchlay> pretty sure they do. Not 100% though
[17:52:41] <P4C0> don't they have an irc channel? XD
[17:52:50] <Skywise> you could prolly find out for sure pretty easily
[17:52:58] <Urchlay> ask KaMii when/if she's paying attention, she tried to get it working with armedslack
[17:53:13] <Skywise> but i don't see much point of having a license and not being able to use it
[17:53:29] <Skywise> i don't think she got hers working
[17:53:37] <ttkay> Transmeta demonstrated in the 1990's just how unimportant x86's legacy crap was to processor performance, a lesson which Intel was quick to embrace, and has only become more true as die transistor densities increase
[17:53:39] <Urchlay> if you use the OS they provide, I'm sure that the license actually works
[17:53:46] <Nh3xus> Well this guy don't use the official OS and is able to stream from network 1080p video sources : check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2-eUrGbl0I&feature=related
[17:53:56] <Urchlay> we're talking about replacing the official OS with slackware though
[17:54:11] <Skywise> the license goes into the config.txt they all use
[17:54:18] <Urchlay> "haich-dee videos"... nice
[17:54:34] <Urchlay> he's using xbian... debian hacked up for the pi?
[17:54:34] <Skywise> its part of the bootloader
[17:54:48] <usuario> debian ush
[17:54:53] <Urchlay> eh
[17:55:56] <Nh3xus> Skywise is correct. Before boot an OS, the RPi does check it's hardware config with the help of a FAT32 partition that store bought license keys and stuff like chosen video output or overclocking stuff
[17:56:29] <Nh3xus> I'm pretty happy of mine though
[17:56:57] <Urchlay> Nh3xus: that makes sense. The question is, once the mpeg2 license is installed and the decoder is unlocked by the bootloader... does normal mplayer (or any other video-playing app shipped with Slackware or built from SlackBuilds.org) actually know how to use the chip?
[17:57:43] <P4C0> there's also this: http://apc.io/
[17:58:33] <P4C0> Urchlay: shouldn't that be kernel's job?
[17:58:53] <Nh3xus> That APC thing is not designed for the same use as the RPi
[17:59:17] <Nh3xus> What makes the RPi different are its GPIO
[18:00:02] <Urchlay> no, not really. Video playing apps would need to talk to the chip. If there's a kernel driver, then the app would talk to it via a device node in /dev... otherwise, the app has to talk directly to the hardware (probably requiring root privilege). Either way though, the app has to know how to use the hardware.
[18:00:17] <P4C0> Nh3xus: yes, I'm just checking it...
[18:00:42] <Crosma> MPlayer doesn't do video acceleration on normal desktop hardware anyway though, does it?
[18:01:02] <Urchlay> the kernel doesn't magically notice "oh, this application is about to call its software video decoding routine, I'll just make it use the hardware instead"
[18:01:08] <P4C0> Urchlay: but doesn't it use x11 for that?
[18:01:17] <usuario> yes
[18:01:43] <Crosma> Oh, MPlayer can, it turns out.
[18:01:48] <Urchlay> Crosma: codec acceleration (not video accel) is what we're talking about here. mplater does support a few hardware mpeg decoder devices
[18:02:00] <Crosma> That's what I meant.
[18:02:20] <Urchlay> P4C0: what would X11 (a display service) have to do with decoding video?
[18:02:34] <Urchlay> I mean after the video's decoded, yes, you can display it with X11

[18:05:00] <Urchlay> hardware overlay, so the X server doesn't know/care about where the video is displayed, and the application doesn't get access to the decoded pixel data?
[18:05:17] <Urchlay> usuario: oh, you're talking about the XVideo extension?
[18:05:37] <P4C0> with omxplayer, mplayer can't use it...
[18:05:48] <Urchlay> that's (one way) how video is displayed, not decoded though

[18:06:33] <P4C0> Urchlay: it seems that you can use any player that supports OpenMAX
[18:07:39] <P4C0> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMAX
[18:07:43] <Urchlay> ah.
[18:08:57] <Urchlay> so I was right. mplayer can't use it because it doesn't support openmax (which is the layer that talks to the chip).
[18:10:36] <Urchlay> looky here though: http://pastebin.com/cqFFweNq
[18:10:40] <P4C0> Urchlay: yes, omxplayer should be used, but there's no slackbuild for it (yet), as for xbmc, no idea, I suppose it should have openmax support
[18:10:48] <Urchlay> a patch that adds openmax support for mplayer
[18:11:24] <P4C0> Urchlay: sweet ;)

[18:12:19] <Urchlay> doubtful, I think openmax is like opengl, needs hardware support to be useful

[18:13:34] <P4C0> not sure if xbmc does the decoding itself or calls something else for that...
[18:14:53] <Urchlay> xbmc's site says it already supports openmax
[18:15:35] <Urchlay> presumably if you built the SBo one on a system where openmax was installed, it would autodetect it (or else you might have to add --with-openmax or such, to the slackbuild.)
[18:16:05] <P4C0> Yup

[18:18:14] <usuario> I am trying to install amd catalyst
[18:18:24] <Urchlay> and you do need kernel support for the chip... found a reference to /dev nodes: http://kotelett.no/ac100/phh/Android2.1/Multimedia/mplayer.txt
[18:19:25] <Urchlay> so you'd need a kernel module for the chip, the openmax library & headers, and then you could build xbmc or a patched mplayer to actually use the stuff. Reasonable enough.

[18:32:32] <Urchlay> LTF: those aren't standard linux function calls. estrdup, emalloc, efree, arg_get_type all look like they're part of openvas itself. Is there a separate openvas-libs package?
[18:33:31] <Nh3xus> Mhh I advise you to change your PS1 variable in order to see your pwd directory
[18:33:50] <Urchlay> it looks like a problem that's specific to the thing you're building (nobody will be able to guess how to fix it without actually looking at your build script and the source itself)
[18:35:20] <LTF> Urchlay:  yes there is
[18:35:53] <Urchlay> yeah... I bet those functions are found in that library (you can double-check by grepping the include files in the library package)

[22:22:00] <ttkay> there's ArmedSlack for putting slackware on ARM-based devices (including phones, which are mostly ARM these days), but I don't think that supports actually using the phone to make phone calls, does it?
[22:22:15] <eviljames> Generally, no.
[22:22:40] <eviljames> When making calls on a cell network, the firmware to that chip (generally speaking) must be closed/binary blob by FCC et al regulation.
[22:22:51] <wood_quinn> Majorly, yes.
[22:22:54] <wood_quinn> pun
[22:22:57] <eviljames> That's why CyanogenMod & crew release different images for different phones - different firmware fo said chips.

[22:26:30] <wood_quinn> Cellulars must be closed source?
[22:26:44] <wood_quinn> Unless you're sure, I don't think that's the case.
[22:26:47] <ttkay> out of curiosity, what's the rationale behind requiring the firmware closed?  I assumed phone companies made them closed out of self-interest.
[22:26:50] <eviljames> Then you should look it up, because I am sure.
[22:27:08] <eviljames> ttkay: No, it's to prevent hax0rs from abusing the capabilities of the antenna and creating makeshift cell jammers.
[22:27:14] <eviljames> cell jammers are for police & three-letter-agencies only.
[22:27:18] <wood_quinn> Because there's legislation requiring by law providers to allow any device access to their networks unless is causes harm.
[22:27:29] <ttkay> I see .. thank you.
[22:27:56] <ttkay> Not that anyone can make a jammer by sticking an ignition coil in a coffee can
[22:27:58] <wood_quinn> But for $2K you can buy a base station that'll operate on European frequencies and jam anyway.
[22:28:10] <wood_quinn> Or pipe through a recorder.
[22:28:12] <wood_quinn> Or whatever.
[22:28:27] <eviljames> wood_quinn: as opposed to $0 + some software mods for a cell phone - $2k is a totally different breed of person that would employ such a tactic for a jammer.
[22:28:33] <eviljames> free + a little skill = any phreaker can do it.
[22:29:05] <wood_quinn> Ah yes. Because we all know how sophisticated the telcos are.
[22:29:21] <ttkay> I believe the explanation, though.  Senselessness is no barrier to government action.
[22:29:41] <eviljames> I wish I could remember the name of the hacker that showed the restriction was silly, that started finger phreaking on a phone while in a meeting with some congress/FCC body..
[22:30:10] <eviljames> that was mid-90s-ish, but that didn't (and doesn't) change the legal/regulatory requirements as they are today.

[22:36:03] <ttkay> that's good to know, TommyC.  Could be useful for highly condensed platforms.
[22:36:28] <TommyC> Since aaa_elflibs is just some shared objects that's in other packages, I thought "let's see how this goes if I have those packages but not aaa_elflibs" but I guess the installer requires aaa_elflibs for some stuff.

[22:38:12] <eviljames> Yes, the files shouldn't be removed.  However it could cause problems at update time
[22:38:44] <eviljames> as in, some version of libc or whatever moved forward, you updated, then aaa_elflibs package didn't change, it gets restored, part of libc (or some other package in elflibs) breaks.
[22:39:16] <eviljames> That is pretty much specific to -current.. generally, it's safe enough not to bother with those packages, all they end up leaving is a small text file in /var/log/packages
[22:39:38] <wood_quinn> And gremlins in /dev/null
[22:39:47] <eviljames> There's always the possibility of gremlins.

[23:38:53] <KaMii> then i would have to recompile hunspell
[23:39:06] <KaMii> and tell it that dictionaries are in /usr/share/hunspell
[23:39:21] <shonudo> the way you did it is the easiest, KaMii
[23:40:16] <Skywise> the search path starts with .::/usr/share/hunspell:/usr/share/myspell
[23:40:24] <Skywise> so why would you need to recompile
[23:40:37] naitso (~naitso@164.132.94.142) left irc: Quit: nite
[23:40:38] <KaMii> oh, didnt notice that
[23:40:46] <KaMii> meh, oh well, it works im happy
[23:40:48] <shonudo> so OOo uses the myspell dir?
[23:41:07] <shonudo> (i'm not using OOo anymore, so i don't knOOow
[23:41:10] <shonudo> )
[23:41:12] <KaMii> lol
[23:41:20] <Skywise> no, i'm sure that was just included by pat as an alternate location for the dictionary
[23:41:28] <KaMii> it does seem wierd there isnt a default directory
[23:41:36] <KaMii> s/directory/dictionary
[23:43:20] <Skywise> it works fine in /usr/share/hunspell
[23:43:42] <Skywise> you can mv myspell to hunspell if you wanted to

[23:57:06] <Skywise> i don't understand what you said
[23:57:17] <Skywise> what is a "make"
[23:57:47] <Nh3xus> He's probably trying to compile something
