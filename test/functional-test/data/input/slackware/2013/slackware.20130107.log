[00:00:08] <wood_quinn> Nor does wasting fifteen minutes on an install that doesn't work, and a week figuring out which package you needed.
[00:00:09] <KaMii> mad_enz: then when you have slackware issues, please dont come here to ask questions
[00:00:35] <KaMii> poprocks: i dont like SSD's because they have very limited rewrites, plus they are overly expensive
[00:00:44] <wood_quinn> Drop an Ubuntu user into a running Slack system and say "start X."
[00:00:51] <mad_enz> maybe not, but the result of picking the wrong combination will
[00:01:01] <KaMii> a 40 gig hdd would be great, great for swap, and your OS
[00:01:08] <wood_quinn> When they ask you "what's X?" You'll realize hearing or reading a package/software name doesn't teach you anything.
[00:01:22] <mad_enz> kamii: then what is the channel for?

[00:01:40] <KaMii> mad_enz: there is a reason they call it, expert install, why do you want n00bs to do expert install?
[00:01:42] <wood_quinn> mad_enz: The emphasis there was "you."
[00:01:48] <wood_quinn> Not "help."
[00:01:48] <KaMii> do you really want to sit in here and help them all out?
[00:01:50] <mad_enz> i usually solve my own slackware issues...at least the last ones i have encounter
[00:02:07] <mad_enz> i usually ask questions to see how other ppl would solve the problem
[00:02:17] <KaMii> mad_enz: this channel is for people that have already RTFM
[00:02:19] Lorem-Ipsum (~Lorem-Ips@unaffiliated/lorem-ipsum) joined ##slackware.
[00:02:42] <mad_enz> nope...but i'd tell them where they could look
[00:02:46] <wed> But this channel is often used for everything but Slackware
[00:02:50] <mad_enz> base on my experience
[00:03:10] <KaMii> wed: like that troll we had last night?
[00:03:14] <KaMii> lol
[00:03:20] <wed> For example ...
[00:04:05] <hplc> the guy with FF issues and broken pkg list?
[00:05:01] <KaMii> mad_enz: when was the last time you took a good look at the l/ set on the slack dvd?
[00:05:19] <KaMii> do you really expect people to sift through all those packages to try and figure out which ones they need?
[00:05:26] <mad_enz> kamii: eons
[00:05:34] <KaMii> slackware is just not setup in that way for it to make sense
[00:05:54] <mad_enz> haven't installed slackware in ages
[00:06:11] <wood_quinn> You want to teach someone about what's in Slackware? Teach them how to make custom tagfiles.
[00:06:23] <mad_enz> last i check, the installation does have "recommended" packages
[00:06:24] <KaMii> mad_enz: then can you please do us all a favor and create a wiki for expert installs and exlplain in detail what each package does, and what it depends on
[00:06:35] <wood_quinn> There's no common sense in taking three hours to install Slackware.
[00:07:02] Action: TommyC uses tagfiles.
[00:07:05] <poprocks> :-/
[00:07:24] <KaMii> if you really do not have 8 gigs of hdd space for an OS, then you probably should not be using a computer anymore.
[00:07:48] <wood_quinn> Tagfiles: Only you can prevent death by natural causes!
[00:08:01] <mad_enz> last i checked, i also have 32TB available...but that is not for OS
[00:08:02] <core_saint> even phones have more memory these days
[00:08:13] <poprocks> KaMii: Agreed, especially if you cut out KDE, reducing it to (some lower number).
[00:08:13] glarb (~glarb@c-68-62-25-191.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) left irc: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[00:08:19] <TommyC> I need to make 14.0 tagfiles, I think all that changed is module-init-tools -> kmod
[00:08:50] <KaMii> well i always cut out KDE, but thats just me, do I go though and try to figure out what libs only KDE uses and take them out?  no bceause i really dont care
[00:09:07] <KaMii> but it would be nice if pat would make a /kde-lib on the install dvd
[00:09:20] <Jdogzz> You might want to save space with something like a Raspberry Pi
[00:09:26] <poprocks> Well, qt would be a starting point ;-)
[00:09:43] <KaMii> Jdogzz: my raspberry pi has a 16 gig sd card
[00:09:45] <poprocks> But that's a nice library to have anyway
[00:09:47] <KaMii> i just didnt install kde
[00:09:49] <ananke> slackware is slowly starting to have larger 'default' install than most other major distros
[00:09:56] <wood_quinn> poprocks: Other stuff uses qt, but I still don't think it belongs in l/
[00:10:01] <xocel> kde isnt the only thing that uses qt tho.
[00:10:03] <wood_quinn> It's an X toolkit after all.
[00:10:19] <mad_enz> as far as the wiki goes, what i did was select the "recommended" packages and the ones i actually knew i needed
[00:10:19] <wood_quinn> Then again, I feel the same way about tango-icon-theme and a few other things that seem out of place.
[00:10:31] <wood_quinn> mad_enz: ...
[00:10:46] <poprocks> wood_quinn: where would GTK+ go then?
[00:10:46] <mad_enz> system didn't boot because important stuff were missing...booted with the cd installed the missing stuff
[00:10:57] <KaMii>  /l looks like my trash folder, its just full of random crap
[00:10:58] <TommyC> mad_enz: recommended != required
[00:11:01] <poprocks> I can see an "xl" floppyset working well.
[00:11:10] <TommyC> mad_enz: There are "REQUIRED" packages and then there are "RECOMMENDED" packages.
[00:11:13] <poprocks> s/can/could
[00:11:16] <TommyC> For example, udev is RECOMMENDED, not REQUIRED.
[00:11:22] <mad_enz> startx...missing libraries...add the the missing libraries
[00:11:35] <wood_quinn> You do realize that by default every package in the tagfiles is required, recommended, or optional.
[00:11:44] <mad_enz> can't remember how long it took but after that, never had a slack problem i couldn't solve or work around
[00:12:08] <KaMii> its really not the suggested way
[00:12:27] <mad_enz> that was the 1st and last time i installed slack
[00:12:29] <wood_quinn> And that 90% are required or recommended.
[00:12:54] <mad_enz> it might have been required then...memory is very fuzzy right now
[00:13:04] <poprocks> Hmm, I've never paid much attention to those tagfiles tbh.  They seem kind of silly.
[00:13:28] <wood_quinn> mad_enz: So you've been running Slack for what, 24 hours now?
[00:13:41] <KaMii> lol
[00:13:47] <mad_enz> 23hr 15min 10.45 sec
[00:13:57] <mad_enz> and counting
[00:14:05] <KaMii> well you cant call youself an expert until you hit the 24 hour mark
[00:14:06] <wood_quinn> Sounds about right.
[00:14:15] <wood_quinn> Good to see you're moving up in the expert world.
[00:14:19] <poprocks> heh.
[00:14:40] <mad_enz> missed that sarcasm there
[00:14:59] <mad_enz> i think my first install was 7
[00:15:06] <wood_quinn> Considering your first activity in this channel was yesterday, I doubt that.
[00:15:54] <mad_enz> all slack installers are on this channel?
[00:16:04] <ananke> right. because for somebody to _run_ slackware, they also have to be in this channel
[00:16:13] <poprocks> Pics or it didn't happen!
[00:16:14] <mad_enz> my bad

[01:15:30] <wood_quinn> That is fast.
[01:15:30] <Demon_Fox> Now to make my factoring program check
[01:15:45] <Demon_Fox> It took 1 minute
[01:16:05] <Demon_Fox> That was a prime in it self
[01:16:08] <wood_quinn> Wow.
[01:16:20] <Demon_Fox> Now to check for 1 to 100000000
[01:16:33] <Demon_Fox> This will take some time for a 800Mhz core to compute
[01:16:35] <wood_quinn> That's almost as fast as I can do it in my head!

[03:26:20] <shonudo> not bad

[03:30:58] <jgeboski> KaMii: what you have now should work, you should just have to rebuild Mesa and install primus
[03:31:20] <jgeboski> primus can be installed alongside VirtualGL, and it's probably good to do that
[03:31:50] <TommyC> Uh...I gotta get working on Primus for the Slackware wiki.
[03:31:53] <TommyC> Completely forgot about that.
[03:32:05] <jgeboski> not everything works nicely in primus yet, though, amonakov (the developer), is doing a nice job
[03:32:44] <KaMii> jgeboski: i need to upgrade my nvidia-kernel im using 310.14
[03:33:16] <KaMii> so it switches automatically?
[03:33:34] <KaMii> if primus doesnt work it will try VirtualGL?
[03:33:58] <TommyC> O_o I thought Primus didn't use VirtualGL at all.
[03:34:11] <jgeboski> it doesn't
[03:34:19] <jgeboski> but, they can be installed alongside each other
[03:34:27] <jgeboski> they both use bumblebee/bbswitch though
[03:34:46] <jgeboski> however, the optirun script that comes with bumblebee only supports VirtualGL
[03:34:54] <jgeboski> so, primus introduces primusrun
[03:34:57] <TommyC> optirun is a script? O_o
[03:35:26] <TommyC> primusrun is a script, but I don't think optirun was
[03:35:27] <jgeboski> TommyC: whoops, no
[03:35:30] <jgeboski> use to be
[03:35:35] <TommyC> ah ok, used to be
[03:35:37] <jgeboski> they made it a glib based binary
[03:35:46] <KaMii> oh ok, so i have to rewrite all my scripts then
[03:36:13] <jgeboski> it might be wise, yes
[03:36:23] <KaMii> optirun foo will just give me VirtualGL
[03:36:36] <jgeboski> I would just say to symlink primusrun to optirun, but you might need VirtualGL for some stuff
[03:36:43] <TommyC> Just: sed -e "s|optirun|primusrun|g" -i foo.sh -i bar.sh -i etc. etc.
[03:36:43] <jgeboski> KaMii: correct
[03:37:03] <KaMii> oh your nvidia-kernel do I need to run that nvidia-switch command first before upgrading?

[03:44:28] <jgeboski> that libGL it talks about is *suppose* to be Mesa's libgl
[03:44:42] <jgeboski> worst case, you just reinstall the Mesa package
[03:45:05] <KaMii> ok, well i will give it a shot
[03:46:04] <jgeboski> but, you have to rebuild Mesa anyways for primusrun
[03:46:28] <jgeboski> also, nvidia-driver is working on your Optimus system o.O?
[03:48:10] <KaMii> no i dont have that on the optimus system
[03:48:38] <KaMii> but it exists on my desktop so thats how I knew about nvidia-switch
[03:48:56] <KaMii> if anything, I can just run that script on the optimus system, i dont see how it will hurt anything
[03:49:29] <jgeboski> it wouldn't work

[04:40:51] <solez> using the --display ?
[04:41:20] <shonudo> nvidia, yes?
[04:41:24] <shonudo> twinview?
[04:41:42] <solez> yes. twinview.
[04:42:05] <shonudo> so your apps just work within each display
[04:42:15] <shonudo> and you _can_ move them from one to the other
[04:42:18] <shonudo> etc
[04:42:29] <solez> you mean, xinerama ? well, i don't use it.
[04:42:30] <shonudo> it shouldn't be a problem
[04:42:42] <shonudo> yeah, with xinerama
[04:42:47] <solez> i have 2 separate desktop. not connected with each other.
[04:42:55] <solez> i am not using xinerama...
[04:42:55] <shonudo> oh, that sort of sucks
[04:43:01] <shonudo> is that what you want?
[04:43:05] <solez> yeah...
[04:43:22] <solez> i prefer this way.
[04:43:35] <shonudo> well each one is independent and redundant, no?
[04:43:39] <solez> yes.
[04:43:51] <shonudo> so you should be able to run two instances of libreoffice, iirc
[04:43:56] <shonudo> so it should be np
[04:44:03] <solez> tried it. not working.
[04:44:10] <solez> even with DISPLAY=:0.0

[05:02:52] <solez> nope. cannot do that on the other display.
[05:04:07] <shonudo> you do realize that what you _want_ is twinview with xinerama, yes?
[05:04:16] <shonudo> because that's really the function you want
[05:04:32] <shonudo> otherwise you use what you have the way it's set up
[05:04:53] <solez> guess it won't without xinerama. :(
[05:05:13] <shonudo> the more i think about it, it shouldn't without xinerama
[05:05:24] <shonudo> it would be weird if it did

[05:08:23] <shonudo> i have to ask: why are you guys running it setup that way?
[05:08:25] <KaMii> if I have chromium open on one screen, then try to open a second one on the other screen, it opens it on the screen chromium is already running
[05:08:30] <shonudo> what does it do for you?
[05:08:51] <KaMii> shonudo: because the other way, I could not access the second display while gaming on wine
[05:09:17] <solez> KaMii, exactly.
[05:09:26] <KaMii> wine would just totally capture both dispalys, making dual monitors useless
[05:09:51] <shonudo> i'd put together a script to use when gaming
[05:10:01] <shonudo> so that the rest of the time it made sense as a box
[05:10:01] <solez> i can run different version of firefox simultaneously on both screen.

[05:30:08] <Skywise> i understand wanting to encrypt  the fs, and it almost makes sense on a laptop or anything easy to steal
[05:30:40] <FEC> Skywise: I figure it makes sense if the feds come knocking and I can reach the circuit breaker.. =)
[05:30:48] <Skywise> but encrypted files are just as impenetrable as an fs is, and easier to maintain
[05:31:15] <Skywise> yeah, the feds will give you less time then you'd imagine

[05:47:22] <Skywise> a competent person can do the same thing in any distro

[05:48:05] <Skywise> well thats another fallacy, that if they knew everything people are saying, they'll know everything people are doing and will do

[05:58:53] <wood_quinn_> Imagine what kind of a country we'd live in if the maximum government salary was $100K.
[05:59:03] <Skywise> its don't give yourself $500k salaries and then pay everyone else $20k
[05:59:26] <Skywise> congressmen make nearly 200k
[05:59:45] <wood_quinn_> Skywise: Without campaign contributions, maybe.
[05:59:58] <Skywise> what the hell for i dunno, but guess who sets their pay rate
[06:00:05] <wood_quinn_> CONGRESS!
[06:00:08] <wood_quinn_> 'cuz 'merica.
[06:00:13] <Skywise> good guess
[06:00:21] <wood_quinn_> Congress sets their own salaries.
[06:00:31] <Skywise> but if the public got to decide their pay, they'd only get $1.98
[06:00:50] <Skywise> and still owe taxes on it
[06:01:06] <FEC> so basically they discuss what can we get away with without the people forming a lynch mob :D
[06:01:15] <Skywise> pretty much
[06:01:16] <wood_quinn_> I think they should do the same thing as presidents do.
[06:01:34] <wood_quinn_> "Here's your house, here's your car. Good luck and have fun!"
[06:01:35] <Skywise> and then they wait until the mob isn't looking
[06:02:00] <wood_quinn_> Well, they get paid too. But a lower stress job doesn't warrant a massive salary.
[06:02:30] <Skywise> i think some people do deserve to get paid well, but i think the balance has gone out the window
[06:03:22] <wood_quinn_> Most of the people that deserve to get paid well actively accept a lower salary. Figure that one out.
[06:03:34] <wood_quinn_> In the legislature, that is.
[06:03:49] <wood_quinn_> It's almost as if being there for something other than the paycheck yeilds better work?
[06:03:51] <wood_quinn_> Nah.
[06:03:54] <wood_quinn_> That's crazy talk.
[06:03:54] <Skywise> i don't mind an athlete getting millions when the team is making billions, but it should be proportional, it would be nice if the games were cheaper to attend
[06:04:23] <wood_quinn_> Personally I don't think athletes should get millions.
[06:04:24] <Skywise> well people accept lower salarys because lower is more then none and work is hard to come by
[06:04:46] <Skywise> sure they should, when the team is raking in billions? yeah share the pie to the people who make it possible
[06:04:47] <wood_quinn_> Sure, you can only work until you're 30. Most people still don't make millions in their lifetimes.
[06:04:56] <Skywise> thats not their fault

[06:05:10] <Skywise> they should share in the prosperity of the sport
[06:05:17] <wood_quinn_> Which I also disagree with completely.
[06:05:32] <Skywise> i don't think they should charge so much, but thats besides the point
[06:05:50] <Skywise> the players should get 70 and the owners 30
[06:05:51] <wood_quinn_> The fact that citizens will pay $300 to watch people beat the crap out of each other on a field for two hours is, frankly, sad.
[06:06:20] <Skywise> the owners will be collecting their revenue for decades where as players are fortunate to play for more then 4 years
[06:06:30] <Skywise> they pay alot more for boxing
[06:06:38] <wood_quinn_> I'm in general a proponent of lowering the salaries of any kind of entertainment based industry.
[06:06:41] <Skywise> but football isn't about smashing each other

[06:07:03] <FEC> wood_quinn_: might as well be boxing =)
[06:07:03] <Skywise> i think jim carey getting 20million a movie is outrageous

[06:09:24] <FEC> its our own damn fault for putting movie and music stars up their on that high horse
[06:09:31] <Skywise> i don't think they should be able to monopolize the viewership like they have

[06:09:58] <wood_quinn_> I think they should allow you to videotap games.

[06:10:56] <wood_quinn_> "How else would they get paid?"
[06:11:05] <Skywise> i like watching the game on tv better then in person
[06:11:12] <wood_quinn_> Many people do.
[06:11:20] <wood_quinn_> Many of those people don't have TVs.
[06:11:39] <Skywise> they'e quite dedicated

[06:12:02] <wood_quinn_> Or should I say, 's/Yet/Due to that/'
[06:12:23] <wood_quinn_> Since I think we all know better than to assume it's coincidental.
[06:13:14] <Skywise> those streaming sites are pretty shady and i don't really trust running scripts from them
[06:13:40] <Skywise> but i don't need to see the game that much
[06:13:40] <wood_quinn_> Why not?
[06:13:51] <wood_quinn_> The script installs a free copy of Real Player man!

[14:51:48] <hiptobecubic> there are some obvious things that could be done

[14:52:03] <hiptobecubic> tablets*

[14:52:20] <hackedhead> thumbs?
[14:52:25] <hackedhead> also, cases.
[14:52:41] <BrokenCog> partly because the fingers on the back are to hold the thing - holding and pressing don't work well together.
[14:53:04] <BrokenCog> but, one might work. or maybe two.
[14:53:23] <hackedhead> yeah, back buttons would only feel right two-handed
[14:53:40] <thumbs> hackedhead: what?
[14:53:47] <hiptobecubic> every game console since N64 has put buttons where your fingers are instead of awkwardly on the front
[14:54:00] <hiptobecubic> thre are buttons for thumbs, which are on the front because your thumbs are there
[14:54:01] <BrokenCog> for holding two-handed.
[14:54:12] <hackedhead> thumbs: apologies. i was speaking of anatomical digits.
[14:54:30] <hiptobecubic> how do you press buttons on the other side of the reader with one hand anyway?

[14:55:51] <hiptobecubic> because i can't push buttons on left when i'm holding right handed. so i need both hands to use them, so i might as well put it somewhere useful when i'm using both hands
[14:56:42] <BrokenCog> ah.  haven't used one with buttons on both sides.  are they duplicate actions, or different? if duplicate it would be for left/right handedness.
[14:56:50] <hiptobecubic> depends on the reader
[14:56:57] <BrokenCog> yeah.
[14:57:01] <hiptobecubic> for the page changing at least
[14:57:17] <hiptobecubic> kindle has both for page change, but also some buttons are only one side i believe
[14:57:26] <hiptobecubic> we have a kind touch, which has its own problems
[14:57:38] <BrokenCog> yes, i think so - beacuse the majority are right handed they make that assumption.
[14:57:50] <hiptobecubic> overall i think it's reasonable. As long as you are going linearly through the text and don't need to reference anything
[14:58:15] <hiptobecubic> which makes it good for novels and newspaper articles and terrible for everything else that might be on paper.
[14:58:38] <hiptobecubic> like educational textbooks

[15:02:02] <Cultist> anyone know if a bash script can pass an ssh password?
[15:02:03] <Blacklite_> I don't like dependancies though. :(
[15:02:21] <BrokenCog> Cultist: ssh won't take passwords on CL.
[15:02:24] <Blacklite_>  I don't think so.
[15:02:29] <cmyster> sure it can, sshpass
[15:02:34] <Cultist> or an rsync password I should say
[15:02:43] <Cultist> meant that, not ssh
[15:02:44] <cmyster> check sbo iirc is called sshpsas
[15:02:48] <Cultist> although the same password
[15:03:16] <BrokenCog> you could probably use ssh or scp with -f to do what you want.
[15:03:20] <Blacklite_> Cultist: that's not very secure.
[15:03:33] <Cultist> doesn't have to be
[15:03:40] <Cultist> it's for a specific purpose
[15:03:40] <Blacklite_> fair enough

[15:23:45] <d4wnr4z0r> trust me, you want to use ssh keys instead. but expect is a tcl mechanism where you write a script that looks for a particular thing and then responds with a particular thing
[15:23:57] <d4wnr4z0r> for example, it can be used to automate interactive installation scripts
[15:24:24] <d4wnr4z0r> or things that asked for passwords

[15:42:45] <Cultist> user specifies a directory variable. Is there an easy way to determine if they added a trailing /, and add one if they didn't

[15:45:54] <d4wnr4z0r> but why?
[15:46:30] <d4wnr4z0r> or sed alone, really
[15:46:44] <d4wnr4z0r> but again... why?
[15:47:24] <Cultist> mostly to make an idiotproof script where a user has to specify the remote directory so you can ensure that there is a trailing /
[15:47:56] <Cultist> but unnecessary at the moment, just something I might add in if I distribute
[15:48:04] <d4wnr4z0r> I mean, why should this script care whether or not there is already a trailing slash? just add one regardless.
[15:49:01] <Cultist> well the idea is to sync the contents of a remote directory, so a different thing will be synced depending on whether or not the user added a /
[15:49:17] <Cultist> so it would cut down on problems if the script uses the / whether the user added it or not
[15:49:30] <d4wnr4z0r> right... so just add a slash in any case
[15:49:58] <Cultist> but that would result in /remote/dir//
[15:50:00] <Cultist> or would that be read the same as /remote/dir?
[15:50:03] <d4wnr4z0r> I don't think I've seen a case where multiple slashes broke something
[15:50:12] <d4wnr4z0r> at least, not that I can recall
[15:50:18] <Cultist> I'll test. I thought it would

[17:27:03] <Jdogzz> I used Mplayer to see if that helped and while it played through all the scenes without creating artifacts, it had periods of slowness elsewhere, to the point where the audio track was a full 2 seconds ahead of the video track.
[17:27:13] <eviljames> It does answer the question.  MKV is really just the container, it might matter what the video/audio codecs are
[17:27:53] <eviljames> mediainfo would tell you more.  Personally, I use ffmpeg to move everything to h.264 Main Profile 4.0 at a reasonably high bitrate if the source material warrants it.

[17:30:53] <eviljames> Are there specific tweaks required for your hardware or monitor config?  Usually, the defaults are sane for xorg drivers (at least, lately.. historically....not so much :P)

[17:34:08] <shonudo> until recently with the bumblebee mess, they've always provided good support for linux
[17:34:46] <shonudo> and they have a proven track record: they can write drivers; ati can't claim that
[17:34:46] <Skywise> looks like the bee bumbled
[17:35:28] <xdan779> ati s closed drivers are still broken on the 3.7.1 kernel upgrade
[17:35:31] <eviljames> I have the luxury to take the stance that I want open source hardware controls.  At least, today I have that luxury.
[17:35:37] <Guest22715> how?
[17:35:46] <shonudo> nouveau
[17:35:50] <Guest22715> I have 3.7.1 kernel and running 12.11 catalyst drivers
[17:35:50] <xdan779> nvidia fixed theres back in december
[17:35:58] <eviljames> ATI provides the spec, open source at least can create a competing implementation to force ATI's hand on these matters
[17:36:00] <eviljames> (hypothetically)
[17:36:09] <shonudo> arduously
[17:36:14] <eviljames> NV does the exact opposite.  All nouveau progress has been made via reverse engineering.
[17:36:15] <xdan779> Guest22715: when will they update there legacy ones

[17:36:34] <shonudo> perhaps
[17:36:35] <eviljames> Intel, imho, still is the best.
[17:36:39] <pprkut> nvidia has been great so far on the tegra front, open source wise

[17:36:44] <eviljames> I use Intel gfx on damn near every machine I have.

[17:36:59] <Guest22715> thats the problem with closed/propietary software
[17:37:04] <Skywise> i don't understand why drivers need to be proprietory, its not like you can copy the hardware from the drivers

[17:42:40] <Skywise> that doesn't clear up what the name is from tho

[17:42:53] <eviljames> Run Command
[17:43:19] <eviljames> Jdogzz: but it's still laggy.  Is it maybe a case of sync being out?  Can you use the audio shifting in mplayer/vlc to bring it to sync?

[17:45:38] <eviljames> Jdogzz: hm.  quite weird..
[17:46:23] <eviljames> "rc" derives from "runcom", from the MIT CTSS system,

[18:30:55] <Jdogzz> Not like autoupdates where it downloads packages from a central repository but one that seeks out updates to its components and then compiles them for itself.
[18:31:19] <eviljames> That would be an absolute disaster.
[18:31:25] <eviljames> ESPECIALLY across ABI changes

[18:44:22] <FLYSWATER> etc
[18:45:12] <eviljames> I saw Slipknot & System of a Down at an Ozzfest one year, both were throwing actual cassettes into the crowd (their demos).  Slipknot's first real album (self-titled?) came out shortly thereafter.  it was pretty good...
[18:45:20] <eviljames> Iowa and onwards was all downhill
[18:45:30] <eviljames> SOAD always sucked.
[18:45:52] <FLYSWATER> well self titled is my fav..
[18:45:52] <eviljames> Actually, that's not true.  The self-titled from them was acceptably bad, not total suckage like everything else they did)

[22:15:57] <nofra> K4k: Start from a terminal maybe
[22:16:03] <lombardo> or should i want another distro?
[22:16:24] <nofra> lombardo: All of my laptops run Slackware

[22:16:45] <lombardo> nofra: i probably need GNOME too right?
[22:16:54] <TommyC> ?
[22:16:59] <TommyC> GNOME was removed from Slackware awhile back.
[22:17:04] <nawcom> the question you'd ask is if linux has driver problems with your laptop. heh
[22:17:24] <lombardo> right... it is KDE
[22:17:44] <TommyC> K4k: You might be able to try Mozilla's Error Console: thunderbird -jsconsole (you can open it in a menu inside thunderbird as well, but I think that's the best you're going to get).
[22:17:50] <nofra> lombardo: try it
[22:17:52] <TommyC> What's KDE?
[22:18:04] <lombardo> nofra: ok will do... now it is running "badblocks"
[22:18:04] <nofra> If it doesn't work, install somethng else
[22:18:11] <lombardo> it is a new laptop but i had to be sure
[22:18:18] <lombardo> ok
[22:18:31] <nofra> But, if another linux distro will work, so will Slackware.
[22:18:31] <K4k> TommyC: Thanks for the tip, I'll check it out. I also found a way to produce a useful log file with a script that sets soem envars before running. I'll try both out. Thanks!
[22:19:34] <TommyC> lombardo: KDE isn't the only DE or even WM in Slackware. Just so you know.
[22:19:48] <nofra> yes, there's TWM

[22:20:27] <nofra> You can run gnome if you like pain
[22:20:40] <lombardo> nofra, i used gnome on ubuntu, it is fine
[22:20:51] <eviljames> nofra: are you the kind of sadist who inflicts that one someone else, or a masochist who inflicts that upon themselves?

[23:17:20] <wizbit> i just had 4 days worth of downtime
[23:17:37] <wizbit> my ISP decided to change my static ip / network without telling me
[23:17:56] <wizbit> first i thought my modem was faulty, then i thought there was something wrong with pfsense
[23:18:23] <wizbit> i usually enter my static details in my modem manually, but that didnt even work anymore
[23:18:58] <wizbit> my ISP only allows DHCP with a MAC address entry and i need to wait 6 minutes after a connection before it works
[23:19:01] <wizbit> jeeeeeeze

[23:23:35] <Urchlay> once you wait 6 mins, then get your IP, does setting that IP manually work?
[23:24:25] <Urchlay> also, you might want to learn how to change the mac address on your card, in case you ever need to in future (ifconfig can do it, if the card/driver supports it, which most do these days)

[23:49:53] <pi31415> $70 for an Apple Magic Mouse.  $5 for a Microsoft USB mouse.
[23:50:09] <pi31415> I wonder whether they made that mouse out of magic beans.
[23:51:01] jdetring (~jay@76-200-121-146.lightspeed.tulsok.sbcglobal.net) joined ##slackware.
[23:52:25] <Skywise> the magic is getting you to pay $70 for a mouse
[23:52:55] <Urchlay> for $70, you should at least get 2 #$%@#$% buttons!
[23:53:22] <Skywise> for $70 you should at least get 2 mice
[23:53:53] <eviljames> Urchlay: the apple mice now do support 2 button
[23:54:02] <eviljames> plus the whole thing is a touchpad for scrolling and pinch/zoom & such
[23:54:19] <Urchlay> I knew the OS had support for multi buttons + scroll wheel etc, in 2005
[23:54:31] <Skywise> so you click it with 2 fingers for the 2nd button?
[23:54:44] <Urchlay> didn't know they finally changed their "2 buttons are too confusing for our elite snob users" policy though
[23:55:23] <Skywise> apple mice are well suited for 3 fingered aliens
[23:55:37] <eviljames> no, click on the right hand side and it's a right click
[23:55:53] <Urchlay> eviljames: oh, that's the one with no buttons at all, the whole top of the mouse is a touchpad?
[23:56:00] <eviljames> yea
[23:56:15] <eviljames> and right hand side click is a 2nd button click (configurable for lefties, though)
[23:56:30] <Urchlay> yah, I've used one. Didn't like the way the scrolling was backwards (move finger up to scroll page down, like playing Flight Sim)
[23:56:32] <Skywise> so why have a mouse thats a touch pad instead of just a touch pad
[23:56:39] <ananke> i don't think a $5 microsoft mouse has any touch technology
[23:56:47] <eviljames> Urchlay: From what I've seen, windows 8 defaults that way... which is crazy
[23:56:53] <ananke> Skywise: because it's not the same thing
[23:57:05] <eviljames> indeed, I think that magic mouse is actually really cool
[23:57:16] <ananke> a mouse with pinch/zoom is a mouse with pinch/zoom. some people prefer the accuracy and speed of mice
[23:57:34] <Urchlay> a $5 ms mouse is probably more reliable. I've used old ms and logitech mice I got for $1 at the goodwill store that kept right on working for years
[23:57:50] <ananke> uhmm, a $5 ms mouse doesn't exist
[23:57:59] <eviljames> am using exactly one of those mice right now.  2 button + scroll wheel, MS branded.  Also using a MS keyboard.
[23:58:04] <Skywise> so a mouse touchpad is more accurate then a touch pad?
[23:58:05] <eviljames> Some of the best products they've ever made.
[23:58:24] <Urchlay> eh, I dunno what they retail for, new. Never bought one. But used ones are $5 or less.
[23:58:28] <Urchlay> I prefer the speed and accuracy of a trackball myself
[23:58:29] <ananke> Skywise: some people prefer the movement of a mouse
[23:58:30] <pi31415> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826105448
[23:58:31] <pi31415> $8 new
[23:58:34] <eviljames> no, moving a mouse is more accurate and precise.  The touchpad part is useful for things like zooming
[23:58:51] <ananke> pi31415: so that's $8 not $5. it's also $3 s&h, so that's $10
[23:58:53] <Skywise> because zoom with the scroll wheel is bad?
[23:59:00] <eviljames> and scrolling, and gesture interactions (ie circle left/circle right)
[23:59:10] <eviljames> Skywise: requires a modifier key or some other way to say "zoom this time, not scroll"
[23:59:14] <eviljames> Which is not required on the magic mouse
[23:59:30] <Urchlay> ananke: "$5 mouse" was a figure of speech, to make a point (that MS mice are much cheaper than Apple), not everything has to be rigorously researched in every conversation
[23:59:58] <ananke> Urchlay: it's a false comparison, since it doesn't compare apples to apples [no pun intended]
