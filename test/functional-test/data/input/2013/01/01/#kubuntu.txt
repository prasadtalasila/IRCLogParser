[11:22] <andybrine> happy new year
[11:22] <andybrine> :)
[11:22] <Wizard> Hi andybrine.
[11:22] <Wizard> To you too.
[11:22]  * Wizard hands beer to andybrine.
[11:22] <andybrine> mmm beer :)
[11:23] <andybrine> Just a quick question
[11:23] <Wizard> Shoot.
[11:23] <andybrine> i have just bought a new lapop before christmas and my usb 3 port does not seem to be working at times
[11:23] <andybrine> do i need extra drivers?
[11:24] <Wizard> At times? you mean from time to time?
[11:24] <andybrine> yeah
[11:24] <andybrine> i have a wireless mouse here
[11:24] <yofel> Wizard: skype is in the partner repository
[11:24] <Wizard> yofel: I enabled in in muon.
[11:24] <andybrine> it works perfectly in one port and does not in the other
[11:24] <yofel> dhq: well, only if you upgrade KDE and X works by now
[11:25] <Wizard> andybrine: Does dmesg say anything useful?
[11:25] <yofel> Wizard: refreshed the cache afterwards? (not sure if it does that by itself)
[11:25] <Wizard> I did apt-get update
[11:26] <Wizard> LOL, I enabled source repo. Sorry:D
[11:26] <andybrine> its picked up my usb 2 port
[11:26] <andybrine> just does not show my usb 4
[11:26] <andybrine> usb 3*
[11:27] <yofel> andybrine: random suggestion: try a newer kernel and see if it helps. There are builds for mainline 3.7
[11:27] <andybrine> how can i upgrade the kernal?
[11:28] <andybrine> sorry, not something i do a lot
[11:28] <andybrine> is that safe?
[11:28] <Wizard> Definitely not.
[11:28] <Wizard> :(
[11:28] <yofel> well, it shouldn't break anything and you can always boot the old one from grub if you need to
[11:28] <yofel> it's not supported, but it might be worth a try here
[11:29] <andybrine> not something i realy want to play with
[11:29] <andybrine> some devices work in the port and others dont
[11:29] <andybrine> just realised that
[11:30] <andybrine> acidently fried a multi usb port the other day because i thought it was that
[11:30] <andybrine> lol
[11:30] <yofel> how can you fry an usb port o.O?
[11:31] <yofel> and does dmesg say something for the not-working devices?
[11:34] <andybrine> i thought it was a lack of power and put a power cable into it and started to fry, lol. (wrong one) it was not connected to laptop though
[11:36] <andybrine> it shows it is there just does not work
[11:42] <andybrine> do you know if i can do anything in the bios?
[11:43] <andybrine> anyone still here who can help
[11:44] <andybrine> sory it was not a quick question
[11:44] <andybrine> i only have 1 usable usb at the mo which is slightly frustrating
[11:44] <andybrine> lol
[11:44] <Wizard> lol
[11:45] <Wizard> Sorry andybrine, I have no idea..
[11:45] <andybrine> ok, no worries. Thanks
[11:45] <andybrine> its a brand new laptop so the port should be fine
[11:51] <andybrine> ok so, if i reboot with the usb connected it works
[11:52] <andybrine> just does not work if pluging in when in ubuntu
[11:52] <andybrine> strange
[11:52] <Wizard> Very strange.
[11:52] <Wizard> Have you tried newer kernel, as yofel suggested?
[11:53] <andybrine> not yet
[11:53] <andybrine> tbh i dont really want to destroy my computer and so slightly reluctant
[11:54] <Wizard> New kernel won't destroy anything.
[11:54] <andybrine> is it simple to update your kernal then?
[11:55] <Wizard> Dunno, prolly there is some additional repo.
[11:56] <Wizard> But I don't know.
[11:56] <Wizard> yofel: ping ^
[11:56] <andybrine> ok i will have a search around
[11:56] <andybrine> thanks for the help
[11:56] <yofel> fetch the 'all' and architecture specific packages that you need from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.7.1-raring/ and install them
[11:56] <Wizard> I didn't help much.
[11:56]  * Wizard afk.
[11:57] <andybrine> i just wondered if i could change something in bios like change to act as usb 2
[11:57] <andybrine> not sure though
[11:58] <yofel> that might indeed be worth looking at
[11:58] <andybrine> yeah, will give it a shot
[11:58] <andybrine> thanks
[12:03] <Wizard> Or maybe not afk.

[15:02] <safridzal> hi. I just installed kubuntu 12.10 as the only OS on a laptop, the battery indicator is so wrong (its detected as full and charged even if unplug). I wont to try the "apci_osi=" but i cannot add it on grub. Its too fast, and i cant see the grub menu.. any suggestion?
[15:05] <safridzal> *I want to try
[15:05] <DarthFrog> safridzal:  Edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and add that option to the default menuentry kernel line.
[15:06] <BluesKaj> safridzal,  to get the grub menu , hold down the left shift key at the bios screen and after wards until Grub apopears , then you can use the "e" to edit any of the entries
[15:06] <DarthFrog> If it works, you'll want to make it permanent.  Manual edits to grub.cfg are ephemeral, being over-written the next time update-grub is run.
[15:06] <DarthFrog> Or do as BluesKaj suggests. :-)
[15:07] <safridzal> i see, the left shift key, got it thanks :D DarthFrog BluesKaj will see if it works :D
[15:08] <DarthFrog> safridzal: If it's still too fast, you can edit the grub.cfg file and change the timeout value.

[16:04] <Wizard> How can I install 32 bit libraries on 64bit kubuntu?
[16:07] <sbivol> Wizard: sudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch:i386
[16:09] <sbivol> Wizard: see it's description to understand what it does. short version: in kubuntu 12.10 you can already have packages installed for more than one architecture, like libqtgu4:amd64 and libqtgui4:i386
[16:10] <sbivol> s/libqtgu4:amd64/libqtgui4:amd64/
[16:11] <Wizard> That's what I want.
[16:11] <Wizard> I need 32bit SDL to run 32bit game :)
[16:16] <BluesKaj> sbivol, multiarch-support as well , unless the app name has changed
[16:17] <sbivol> if you did „sudo apt-get install <game-name>:i386”, then it should have installed libsdl1.2debian:i386  (or other packages) for it's architecture, so you should be all set. otherwise, filter by „libsdl :i386” in Muon and install those packages
[16:17] <BluesKaj> err Wizard ^
[16:17] <Wizard> OK, thank you sbivol, BluesKaj.

[17:12] <anunaki_>  hello
[17:12] <Wizard> Hi anunaki_.
[17:13] <anunaki_> anyone know how to increase the space of the drive where all the files reside on a flash drive?
[17:14] <anunaki_> my hard drive in file manager is showing my 906.8mib when the actual pen drive is 16gb
[17:14] <anunaki_> or am i limited since its on usb drive and not internal hard drive
[17:14] <Smokers> look your setting in your file manager anunaki
[17:14] <Wizard> What do you mean, anunaki_?
[17:15] <Wizard> By "increasing space"?
[17:15] <anunaki_> well i encountered a problem on my linux mint on usb where i was installing updates
[17:16] <anunaki_> it then stopped and said i ran out of space...
[17:16] <anunaki_> so i deleted mint and installed kubuntu... which runs better on usb by the way..
[17:16] <Wizard> Ah, you run system from pendrive?
[17:16] <anunaki_> yes
[17:17] <Wizard> Clearing apt package cache give good effects :)
[17:17] <anunaki_> im new to doing this too.. so i dont know if i limited as to what i can do in linux.. one thing i realized is the system doesnt save changes i made to it when i restart computer
[17:17] <sbivol> anunaki_: if you are running Linux from USB, then it creates a file on your pendrive for storing persistent data. it's that file that has no more space
[17:18] <Wizard> Yes, Ubuntu's USB Creator does that.
[17:18] <anunaki_> sbivol, i added persistent data space.. like 3gb
[17:18] <sbivol> anunaki_: if changes are lost on reboot, then it probably didn't get created
[17:18] <anunaki_> but i dont see it.. and it seemed to have not work on my last distro on usb
[17:19] <anunaki_> because right now in file manager i see my computers internal hd, the pendrive, and then the 906mb system drive
[17:20] <anunaki_> but no persistent drive
[17:20] <anunaki_> i wnt to make sure it created the space specified in Universal Usb creator
[17:21] <Smokers> anunaki, is flag the button save session ?
[17:22] <anunaki_> smokers, come again?

[17:27] <anunaki_> that will tell me how to do it after i created the live usb?
[17:29] <anunaki_> smokers, that link says i have to type "peristent word" at boot menu>?
[17:31] <Smokers> anunaki, is easier if you use this:https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[18:18] <anunaki_> smokers, thanks. that ws what i needed.. to use a partition manager and rezise the partition and save as casper-rw..
[18:19] <anunaki_> i left the file alone... its 4gb... just learned fat32 persistence cant be bigger than 5gb?

[19:20] <Guest33547> and everytime i restart compter i have to dowmload updats
[19:20] <Guest33547> eveeeytme
[19:21] <Guest33547> any idea why updates ddont get saved
[19:25] <musca> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD/Persistence
[19:34] <Guest33547> i also have prooblem installing updates..
[19:38] <TheLordOfTime> Guest33547, if you're on a live system without persistence you will always have to do that
[19:38] <TheLordOfTime> i'm assuming yoru settings are also not being saved.
[19:38] <TheLordOfTime> that's the nature of the live environment, unless you write the ISO to a USB with persistence.
[19:40] <Snowhog> TheLordOfTime: Persistence won't help with application and/or kernel updates, yes? Persistence just allows you to save 'stuff' - downloaded items and such, doesn't it?
[19:40] <BarkingFish> hi guys - does anyone know why so many of the ALT+SysRq keys have been disabled?
[19:41] <TheLordOfTime> Snowhog, if persistence in the Kubuntu is similar to the Ubuntu/Lubuntu, it should save package updates
[19:41] <TheLordOfTime> and i think it holds back kernel upgrades by default
[19:41] <BarkingFish> You can't deliberately crash your system anymore - Alt+SysRq R (from REISUB) is blocked too, coupla others I used to use, like watching for blocked processes, etc
[19:41] <Snowhog> BarkingFish: Which ones, and in what version of *buntu?
[19:42] <BarkingFish> 12.10, Alt SysRq C, W and B, + some others I can't immediately remember
[19:42] <BarkingFish> you try and do them in a terminal, you get "This SysRq function has been disabled"
[19:43] <BarkingFish> *function/operation
[19:55] <Guest33547> lord of tme, so it does or doesnt save updates... is trying kubuntu on usb like demo mode or something?
[19:56] <Guest33547> it calls me live user and wont allow ,e to edit that to my name i settings
[19:57] <TheLordOfTime> Guest33547, unless you used unetbootin or the USB startup Disk creator from an ubuntu system, it won't have persistence
[19:57] <TheLordOfTime> at least last i checked
[19:57] <TheLordOfTime> so that's why your updates dont stay nor your name changes
[19:57] <TheLordOfTime> and you're not able to change that username on the liveusb
[19:57] <TheLordOfTime> on any version of Ubuntu
[19:57] <Guest33547> i see the pesisttnccc file in the file manager
