[03:03] <shadeslayer> bah
[03:03] <shadeslayer> Riddell: seems like that FUSE patch in kde4libs causes alot of issues 
[03:03] <shadeslayer> see bug 313888

[04:15] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I've removed the patch and uploaded
[06:32] <jussi> morning all
[06:45] <highvoltage> hey jussi 
[06:46] <jussi> highvoltage: good morning Mr Carter
[07:43] <shadeslayer> hey jussi, highvoltage
[07:43] <shadeslayer> ssup
[07:44] <jussi> good morning shadeslayer
[07:44]  * jussi notes highvoltage went to bed
[07:45] <shadeslayer> heh
[07:50] <shadeslayer> wtf
[07:51] <shadeslayer> vlc is just skipping over 80% of the song
[07:51] <shadeslayer> so is amarok
[07:59] <shadeslayer> as does ... chrome O_O
[08:08] <jussi> shadeslayer: ahh I remember something like that in the past... on amarok
[08:09] <shadeslayer> I think that file is corrupted
[08:09] <jussi> well that would explain it...
[08:09] <jussi> lol
[08:10] <shadeslayer> yeah, playing other files works
[08:11] <jussi> iirc, it was playing files over networks last time that was the iddue
[08:12] <jussi> you know you are tired when this happens...
[08:12] <jussi> jussi@Albatross:~$ sudo apt-get upday
[08:12] <jussi> [sudo] password for jussi: 
[08:14] <shadeslayer> :D
[08:14] <shadeslayer> jussi: how's elodi?
[08:14] <jussi> shadeslayer: doing well, turned 1 the other week
[08:15] <shadeslayer> oh ... Belated happy birthday to her!
[08:15] <jussi> :D
[08:35] <soee> good morning
[08:40] <shadeslayer> hi soee
[09:10] <Peace-> problem with mtp on 13.04
[09:10] <Peace-> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/28/plasma-desktopc29846.png
[09:10] <Peace-> and it doesn't find the package
[09:11] <Peace-> samba still doesn't work ...
[09:43] <shadeslayer> btw
[09:43] <shadeslayer> does it make sense to add a page to the installer asking the user to choose a browser?
[09:44] <shadeslayer> Peace-: what pops that question?
[09:47] <yofel_> shadeslayer: that would need a short pro/con list integrated so people can actually make an educated choice
[09:48] <shadeslayer> why? I'd say that list rekonq/chromium/firefox
[09:48] <shadeslayer> most people would know about those
[09:48] <shadeslayer> if they don't, stick with the default
[09:48] <shadeslayer> ( which will be rekonq )
[09:50] <yofel_> as microsoft got forced to add a browser choice I guess it's fair to have one
[09:50] <yofel_> question is where to put it
[09:50] <shadeslayer> after the page where we ask if the user wants to install codecs
[09:50] <yofel_> the only customization currently is the third-party checkbox at the beginning
[09:50] <shadeslayer> right
[09:50] <shadeslayer> we add 3 huge icons
[09:50] <shadeslayer> because people like huge icons
[09:50] <yofel_> hm, true. Needs to be before the installation start, which is after partitioning
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[09:51] <shadeslayer> right
[09:51] <shadeslayer> it also needs to check if the user is connected to the network
[09:51] <shadeslayer> which brings us to
[09:51] <shadeslayer> wifi support in the installer
[09:52]  * shadeslayer is checking out ubiquity to check how difficult this is going to be
[09:52] <yofel> wasn't that only hanging on insufficient developer time?
[09:52] <shadeslayer> then there's also the webcam stuff that the gtk ui of ubiquity has
[09:52] <shadeslayer> yofel: dunno, but I'm compiling a list of features I want to work on next month
[09:52] <yofel> what for? user logo?
[09:52] <shadeslayer> yep
[09:53] <xnox> gtk - has wifi page. The base controller is network aware and can tell plugins/pages whether or not there are internetz.
[09:53] <shadeslayer> seems fairly trivial
[09:53] <shadeslayer> ( just from reading the webcam plugin )
[09:53] <shadeslayer> xnox: cool :)
[09:53] <shadeslayer> xnox: I'm going to need all the help I can get to implement this :P
[09:53] <shadeslayer> yofel: I'm also thinking of doing this in QML xD
[09:54] <yofel> ack
[09:54] <yofel> that's the way to go with qt5 anyway
[09:54] <shadeslayer> xnox: do you think that if I write a page to choose a browser, that's going to be accepted?
[09:54] <shadeslayer> or would that go against some sort of design or sth
[09:54] <yofel> though porting ubiquity to qml is probably something for post-14.04
[09:55] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[09:55] <shadeslayer> but I don't want to use .ui for new stuff
[09:55] <shadeslayer> better to just write it in QML
[09:56] <yofel> sure, if the looks aren't too different, go ahead
[09:56] <xnox> shadeslayer: i am really confused why one would want to choose a browser, considering that we are not forced by law (yet) and it's a waste of space on the CD (majority will pick default/first and the other one will be removed by ubiquity at cleanup)
[09:56] <yofel> i just has to fit into ubiquity overall
[09:56] <shadeslayer> yofel: right
[09:56] <shadeslayer> xnox: oh I don't plan on including the browser on the CD
[09:56] <xnox> shadeslayer: my position here is that sort of thing should be done on first-login instead.
[09:57] <shadeslayer> xnox: it's like the restricted codecs
[09:57] <shadeslayer> you can tick off "I also want to install Firefox/Chromium" and we add that to the list of things to be installed
[09:57] <xnox> shadeslayer: it's nothing like resticted codecs (which we are not allowed on the CD). Unless you are trying to offer Chrome/Opera?!
[09:58] <shadeslayer> xnox: I meant in terms of implementation
[09:58] <shadeslayer> it *would* be like that
[09:58] <xnox> shadeslayer: out of scope, make the installation longer, confusing & technical. You are free to do it in the qt frontend =)
[09:58] <shadeslayer> xnox: that's what I was asking about :P
[09:58] <xnox> but gtk frontend will not be having that ;-)
[09:58] <shadeslayer> right
[09:59] <shadeslayer> it's just that our users are asking for this
[09:59] <shadeslayer> because our current default browser is not up to the mark
[09:59] <shadeslayer> I wonder if we can switch to chromium by default
[09:59] <shadeslayer> oh wait, not in line with our cycle
[10:02] <shadeslayer> xnox: btw how do you test new stuff in ubiquity?
[10:05] <xnox> lubuntu uses chromium by default.
[10:05] <shadeslayer> I see
[10:06]  * shadeslayer will ask lubuntu devs how their experience has been
[10:06] <xnox> shadeslayer: depends, usually I boot a VM into installer. stop lightdm, stop ubiquity, pkill -9 X, download/patch individual files, and start ubiquity again.
[10:06] <shadeslayer> bah :P
[10:06] <shadeslayer> sounds like alot of work
[10:06] <xnox> (where start is literal $ start/stop are literal)
[10:07] <xnox> it's safe.
[10:07] <shadeslayer> okay
[10:12] <Riddell> shadeslayer: how much does plasma active need that fuse patch?
[10:12] <shadeslayer> I don't remember, I can't find the IRC logs I saved
[10:13] <shadeslayer> I'll ask in #active again
[10:15] <shadeslayer> Riddell: <notmart> shadeslayer: pa3 will still work..
[10:19] <shadeslayer> good thing we added it earlier in the cycle rather than later ....
[10:19] <shadeslayer> Riddell: btw I also have bodega packaging, but all of it needs descriptions and reviewing
[10:20] <shadeslayer> I can't think up of a good description ... so haven't uploaded it anywhere
[10:22] <Riddell> shadeslayer: that's the PA software shop thing?
[10:22] <shadeslayer> yep
[10:24] <Riddell> shadeslayer: there's your description :)
[10:24] <shadeslayer> bodega : "PA software shop thing"
[10:29] <sem_> shadeslayer: i have a nexus tablet 7 and when i have installed kio-mpt i was able to browse nexus with usb cable
[10:29] <sem_> shadeslayer: after that i got that pop
[10:30] <sem_> wtf i have  a different nick
=== sem_ is now known as Peace-
[10:30] <Peace-> shadeslayer: ^ sem was me 
[10:30] <shadeslayer> righto
[10:30] <shadeslayer> I see
[10:31] <shadeslayer> Peace-: check if you have kio-mtp installed?
[10:31] <Peace-> i have 
[10:31] <shadeslayer> if it is, then that shouldn't pop up
[10:31] <Peace-> infact i can browse 
[10:31] <Peace-> but ...when i click on a video it says that i need mtp stuff
[10:31] <shadeslayer> sounds like a bug in qapt?
[10:31] <Peace-> so i searched like it says
[10:31] <shadeslayer> 0.o
[10:31] <Peace-> and it did not find the package
[10:32] <Peace-> shadeslayer: i guess no 
[10:32] <Peace-> shadeslayer: cuz dragon player can't play file from nexus
[10:32] <Peace-> instead vlc can 
[10:32] <Peace-> i guess that dragon player needs some package to play file from mtp devices
[10:32] <shadeslayer> kind of
[10:32] <Peace-> but i have even tried to install mtp-tools+
[10:32] <Peace-> and nothing is changed
[10:33] <shadeslayer> Peace-: make sure you have the requisite gst plugins
[10:33] <shadeslayer> gst-{good,bad,ugly}
[10:33] <shadeslayer> Peace-: what's the video format?
[10:33] <Peace-> i guess mov ?
[10:33] <Peace-> h264 codec
[10:33] <Peace-> for sure
[10:34] <Peace-> ok shadeslayeri will try to investigate better
[10:34] <shadeslayer> install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
[10:34] <shadeslayer> should work after that
[10:39] <Peace-> shadeslayer: btw the idea to ask which browser user want install is good
[10:48] <Riddell> rperier: new nick?
[10:52] <rperier> Riddell: yeah it's more professional ;)
[10:53] <Peace-> shadeslayer: no it doesn't work http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/28/plasma-desktopa29846.png
[10:54] <shadeslayer> wtf
[10:55] <Peace-> shadeslayer: i have already installed gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-base
[10:55] <shadeslayer> right
[10:55] <Peace-> but it seems it suck ;D
[10:55] <shadeslayer> yeah
[10:55] <shadeslayer> something else is wrong
[10:55] <Peace-> bah :D 
[10:55] <Peace-> shadeslayer: but with vlc works fine 
[10:56] <Peace-> dragonplayer again sucks
[10:56] <shadeslayer> yeah pgst is buggy
[10:56] <shadeslayer> Peace-: apachelogger probably has a better idea
[10:56] <Peace-> shadeslayer: well there is not a problem shadeslayer i mean i use vlc 
[10:57] <Peace-> but at least you know that there is some problem  about mtp and dragonplayer and qapt
[10:57] <shadeslayer> right
[10:57] <shadeslayer> it's not about mtp, it's some weird problem between dragon and pgst and qapt
[10:57] <Peace-> ya
[10:57] <Peace-> even samba has again a problem 
[10:58] <Peace-> i have tried samba on windows and nexus kuibunt can't use samba correctly
[10:58] <shadeslayer> you mean kubuntu on the nexus can't access samba?
[10:58] <Peace-> shadeslayer: look http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5sW2Xr7f5Q
[10:58] <Peace-> timeout on server
[10:59] <shadeslayer> oh lord jesus
[10:59] <Peace-> :D time to eat :D
[10:59] <Peace-> bb
[11:14] <xnox> Are Qt packagers around?
[11:14] <xnox> Or should I talk to here or on #debian-* channels?
[11:14]  * xnox is after Qt5 and not duplicating packaging work
[11:15] <xnox> (there are now a couple of Qt5 PPAs and a Debian ITP and I just want Qt5 in the archive)
[11:16] <yofel> xnox: I think you should talk to fabo
[11:16] <xnox> yofel: thanks.
[11:19] <fabo> xnox: it's going to be uploaded to experimental (today on in the next couple of days)
[11:19] <fabo> xnox: packaging is done and up-to-date on git.debian.org
[11:19] <xnox> fabo: awesome! I've now searched for you around to realise it's you doing it everywhere ;-)
[11:20] <fabo> not me, we're a team ;)
[11:20] <xnox> fabo: any help needed?
[11:20] <tsimpson> there are the PPA(s) from https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers too if you're impatient
[11:20] <fabo> xnox: at this point, not much. it has been well tested. we're pretty happy with the result
[11:21] <fabo> xnox: you'll need new qt4 packages to co-exist with qt5
[11:21] <xnox> tsimpson: I'm impatient to stop using that repository & start pointing people to the archive =)
[11:24] <Peace-> shadeslayer: mmm maybe samba is fixed on rarin 
[11:24] <Peace-> i just checked again 
[11:24] <xnox> fabo: as far as I can see, once ready. You will be able to sync/upload it everywhere in Raring, won't you?! And then i can chase up Archive Admins to fast track new binary packages through ubuntu new queue.
[11:25] <shadeslayer> Peace-: awesome
[11:25] <xnox> I'd rather not wait for Debian New Queue delay.
[11:25]  * shadeslayer rages at phonon + python being under documented
[11:25] <fabo> xnox: that's the plan
[11:25] <xnox> fabo: ;-) awesome.
[11:34] <Peace-> i need to check better this story of samba 
[12:31] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: hm?
[12:31] <shadeslayer> Peace-: ^
[12:31] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: see http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/28/plasma-desktopa29846.png
[12:32] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: Phonon has undocumented python bindings
[12:32] <shadeslayer> ( separate issue )
[12:32] <Riddell> shadeslayer: I think it has two undocumented python bindings
[12:32] <Riddell> one in pyqt and one in pykde
[12:32] <shadeslayer> the pyqt ones are somehwat documented if lacking features
[12:32] <shadeslayer> the pyKDE one is non-existent
[12:33] <yofel> apachelogger: btw. what's the status of kpythonpluginfactory in raring? or what's needed to get the kcm stuff working again?
[12:33] <shadeslayer> took me an hour to figure this much out : http://paste.kde.org/658196/
[12:33] <yofel> we're slowly nearing feature freeze and I would like to have it working before that so we can look for alternatives if needed
[12:34] <Peace-> apachelogger: i was using my nexus 7 tablet and i have installed kio-mtp , i clicked on a video and dragon player was starting then  i got http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/28/plasma-desktopa29846.png
[12:34] <Peace-> apachelogger: and it did not find any package to install 
[12:34] <Peace-> apachelogger: so i open it with vlc and it worked without problems 
[12:34] <Peace-> apachelogger: btw shadeslayer has said to install gstremaer ugly betty and good ;D but i did already i t
[12:35] <shadeslayer> oh 
[12:35] <shadeslayer> ohhhhh
[12:35] <shadeslayer> Peace-: *maybe* kio-mtp/libmtp just doesn't support playing video files yet?
[12:35] <shadeslayer> iirc previews didn't work either
[12:36] <Peace-> shadeslayer: mm vlc worked ?
[12:36] <shadeslayer> oh good point
[12:36] <apachelogger> Peace-: enotsupported
[12:36] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: not supported on gst?
[12:36] <apachelogger> streaming from KIO is not supported in phonon
[12:36] <apachelogger> it works sometimes
[12:36] <apachelogger> it doesn't others
[12:36] <apachelogger> that is why it is not supported
[12:36] <shadeslayer> ah
[12:37] <Peace-> apachelogger: it's ok but ... why qapt asks to find stuff ?
[12:37] <apachelogger> because you are trying to stream from KIO
[12:37] <Peace-> :D ok for me there is not problem dragon player is already removed 
[12:37] <Peace-> with vlc works fine
[12:38] <shadeslayer> vlc does not use kio?
[12:38] <Peace-> i dunno i clicked on dolphin open with vlc and it worked
[12:38] <apachelogger> it copies the file
[12:38] <shadeslayer> yes, because vlc does not use kio!
[12:39] <Peace-> ah
[12:39] <apachelogger> because vlc's desktop file is not shit
[12:39] <Peace-> :D
[12:39] <shadeslayer> because vlc is not shit
[12:39] <Peace-> vlc rocks
[12:39] <shadeslayer> I can't say the same for dragon :P
[12:39] <apachelogger> dragonplayer is not shit
[12:39] <Peace-> never used 
[12:40] <Peace-> i mean untill today
[12:40] <Peace-> then i even removed it :D
[13:01] <yofel> apachelogger: ping?
[13:04] <shadeslayer> xnox: question, if I read this correctly, do I just add a PageKde class to ubiquity/plugins/ubi-webcam.py along with a ui file and it'll pop up in the installer?
[13:05] <xnox> shadeslayer: it should. You will need some webcamy widget (as for gtk we wrote our own using Gtk).
[13:06] <xnox> shadeslayer: also check if webcam makes sense at all.
[13:06] <xnox> on gtk side it sets the user account avatar to that picture.
[13:06] <xnox> I don't know if KDE has user account avatars or shows them to the user at all.
[13:06] <shadeslayer> xnox: for the first, I wrote this very small program that does it : http://paste.kde.org/658238/
[13:06] <xnox> As the alternative to webcam picutre one can choose one of the stock images.
[13:06] <shadeslayer> and yes, we have lightdm kde which does show it
[13:06] <shadeslayer> as well as the kicker
[13:07] <xnox> awesome. lightdm on the ubuntu side doesn't show pictures =/
[13:07] <shadeslayer> heh :)
[13:07] <xnox> that phonon snippet looks good =)
[13:07] <shadeslayer> *nod* :P
[13:09] <shadeslayer> xnox: the gtk implementation seems a bit ew
[13:10] <xnox> shadeslayer: i don't think at the time there was a webcam widget at all.
[13:10] <xnox> shadeslayer: do you know if there is one now?
[13:10] <xnox> we could port it....
[13:10] <shadeslayer> not that I know of, nope
[13:10] <shadeslayer> sorry, I don't follow gtk development that closely :P
[13:11] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: note that a videoplayer is comprised of a videowidget and an audiooutput, I do not thin you'll need an audiooutput
[13:11] <shadeslayer> oic
[13:11] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: I don't think I'll be using the exact same code anyway
[13:11] <xnox> there is libcheese-gtk-dev, not sure if it has python bindings and/or available on the cd already.
[13:12] <shadeslayer> I'll probably embed the videowidget
[13:12] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: yeah, just pointing it out ;)
[13:12] <shadeslayer> into a ui file
[13:12] <shadeslayer> :)
[13:12] <xnox> usb-creator with flashing nexus7 images just got uploaded into ubuntu.
[13:12] <xnox> i am not expecting for kde frontend to break, but i didn't test it.
[13:13] <xnox> and also i didn't add the UI to the kde frontend to have support for flashing nexus7 images.
[13:13] <apachelogger> actually it has some bugs that need to be looked at anyway
[13:15] <petersaints> I just noticed that there's a newer version of rekonq 2.1. Will it reach quantal backports? Also Ktorrent is still at 4.2 in the official repos and 4.3.1 is already available. Any plans to backport it?
[13:16] <Riddell> hmm, I really need to do an upstream health script
[13:16] <Riddell> thanks petersaints, we'll get those done
[13:16] <petersaints> tks RIdell
[13:17] <xnox> Riddell: is the python3 port of usb-creator-kde complete?
[13:17] <Riddell> xnox: it's needing you to test it :)
[13:17]  * xnox , by accident, didn't upload it
[13:18] <Riddell> xnox: you accidently didn't upload it?
[13:18] <xnox> correct =)
[13:18] <xnox> Riddell: well ./bin/usb-creator-kde shebang wasn't changed to python3, but now I am installing python3-pykde4 to test it.
[13:18] <Riddell> thanks
[13:20] <xnox> Riddell: surprisingly the theming is nice. It almost looks like a GTK app.
[13:21] <xnox> I wonder if a few icons can be remapped to gtk icons and then the two would be like the same.
[13:21] <apachelogger> it's the Qt way
[13:21] <xnox> no unity integration in the doc, no icon, no progress =(
[13:22] <xnox> but i guess, usb-creator-kde doesn't care about that ;-)
[13:24] <Riddell> xnox: no surprise there, Qt put in a lot of effort to making it integrate into gtk environments
[13:24] <Riddell> shame the opposite doesn't happen
[13:25] <Riddell> xnox: oh I see you're making changes for nexus7 is usb-creator, any UI in that?
[13:25] <xnox> i think it did at one point.
[13:26] <xnox> Riddell: the gtk frontend, checks for fastboot backend and then it does some changes to the UI: updates some strings, skips showing .iso (.img only), add legal text button & poop-up. And that's about it.
[13:26] <xnox> some pointless columns are hidden in the tree view.
[13:27] <xnox> there is an upstart job to poop-up usb-creator, when nexus7 is inserted. And currently that is shipped in the -gtk package, but can move into -common when kde frontend is ready as well.
[13:28] <shadeslayer> heh
[13:29] <shadeslayer> xnox: turns out the phonon gst backend we have in the archive cannot save snapshots :P
[13:29] <shadeslayer> we need a new phonon gstreamer release
[13:29] <xnox> 8-)
[13:30] <apachelogger> nono
[13:30] <shadeslayer> ?
[13:30] <apachelogger> what we need is someone to QA a new release so that I can make that happen
[13:31] <shadeslayer> you have a new pgst release lined up?
[13:31] <apachelogger> doing the release is a no-brainer, getting it QAd is apparently a half a year task
[13:31] <shadeslayer> lol
[13:31] <apachelogger> I have releases of both bakends lined up since dec 7
[13:31] <apachelogger> I even asked kde-testing to do QA
[13:31] <apachelogger> no dice
[13:31] <shadeslayer> give me the tars, I'll make a package and someone here can test
[13:31] <apachelogger> so here we are almost 2 months later, still no release in sight :P
[13:32] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: you saw my QA document :P
[13:32] <shadeslayer> oh
[13:32] <shadeslayer> shit
[13:32] <shadeslayer> not that 
[13:32] <yofel> before you do phonon q/a tell me what's needed to get python kcms working again - or where to look (i.e. KPPF or pykde)
[13:32]  * shadeslayer runs away
[13:32] <apachelogger> it is a requirement to build that crap from source and run like 300 test cases
[13:32] <apachelogger> yofel: tell  me where my pykde source is
[13:33] <yofel> pull-lp-source pykde4 raring
[13:33] <apachelogger> though I think I have those on my other pc, so I won't get to them before this evening
[13:33] <apachelogger> yofel: I have a patch
[13:33] <yofel> gimme so I can Q/A that later
[13:33] <apachelogger> CANNOT DO
[13:34]  * yofel steals patches from fedora in the meanwhile
[13:34] <apachelogger> upstream it actually
[13:34] <xnox> Riddell: installed fine using python3 \0/
[13:35] <apachelogger> that is actually why I lost it, I was looking for a way to contact upstream and then got distructed by something or someone
[13:35] <apachelogger> *distracted
[13:35] <apachelogger> trololo
[13:35] <yofel> that's what reviewboard is for?
[13:35] <apachelogger> no
[13:35] <apachelogger> reviewboard is for us to waste time
[13:35] <Riddell> xnox: awooga, will you upload at some point or shall I?
[13:35] <apachelogger> because people are afraid of gerrit
[13:36] <apachelogger> just like bugzilla is for us to waste time
[13:36] <apachelogger> becasue people are afraid of jira
[13:36] <yofel> huh, why?
[13:36] <xnox> Riddell: i'll do it, now.
[13:36] <yofel> (jira)
[13:36] <xnox> Riddell: usb-creator - the most active upstream project of today! Two new releases in a single day =)
[13:39] <apachelogger> yofel: because it is not free sofware
[13:40] <shadeslayer> xnox: does ubiquity simply copy the image to ~/.face ?
[13:40] <shadeslayer> erm
[13:40] <shadeslayer> ~/.face.icon
[13:41] <apachelogger> oh btw
[13:41] <apachelogger> kde uses .face
[13:41] <shadeslayer> nope
[13:41] <apachelogger> dude
[13:41] <shadeslayer> ~/.face.icon
[13:41] <shadeslayer> Check it for yourself
[13:42] <apachelogger> who was using .face then?
[13:42] <apachelogger> gnome?
[13:42] <apachelogger> someone was using .face
[13:42] <shadeslayer> .face is deprecated
[13:42] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: was that changed in .10 then?
[13:42] <shadeslayer> iirc xdg specified ~/.face
[13:42] <shadeslayer> nope
[13:42] <shadeslayer> iirc ~/.face.icon has been there for a couple of releases now
[13:42] <shadeslayer> before that, I didn't notice it
[13:42] <apachelogger> nono
[13:42] <apachelogger> see
[13:42] <shadeslayer> as in, I didn't bother checking
[13:43] <apachelogger> the reason in quantal lightdm does not show the nice pictures
[13:43] <BluesKaj> Hi folks
[13:43] <apachelogger> is because lightdm uses accountsservices or something which uses .face.icon
[13:43] <apachelogger> wheres all the kde stuff uses .face
[13:43] <shadeslayer> hmm
[13:43] <shadeslayer> well .. it's face.icon now
[13:43] <shadeslayer> which is all that matters
[13:43] <apachelogger> all good then
[13:43] <apachelogger> hooray for standards
[13:44] <shadeslayer> standards ftw
[13:44]  * xnox has no idea what it really does, nor have I tested that it still works.
[13:44] <shadeslayer> heh
[13:45] <shadeslayer> bbiab
[14:03] <jussi> you know, can someone make me something awesome... I want a pattern unlock as an option for my sudo password when it is used graphically  (like the unlock pattern on an android phone...)
[14:05] <apachelogger> jussi: that'd require someone to know pam, which I think no one on the team does ;)
[14:06] <jussi> apachelogger: :(
[14:50] <jussi> shadeslayer: ping
[14:50] <shadeslayer> pong
[14:50]  * jussi pms
[14:51] <shadeslayer> you pms?

[16:49] <Riddell> rick_timmis: hello
[16:49] <Riddell> rick_timmis: you're after a business card?
[16:49] <Riddell> Mamarok: are you going to fosdem?
[16:50] <Mamarok> Riddell: no, unfortunately not
[17:07] <Riddell> should we have kio-mtp installed by default?
[17:08] <Riddell> shadeslayer: you packaged it ^^
[17:08] <shadeslayer> yes
[17:08] <shadeslayer> Riddell: with one caveat
[17:08] <shadeslayer> we need to upload a new libmtp9 with the updated device list before feature freeze
[17:11] <Tm_T> that's only in raring?
[17:13] <shadeslayer> yeah
[17:13] <shadeslayer> you can get it from the experimental ppa
[17:14] <shadeslayer> for quantal ... I don't think I've updated the snapshot for precise
[17:17] <Tm_T> ah thanks
[17:27] <Riddell> shadeslayer, yofel: any idea what phoenix_firebrd's e-mail is?
[17:27] <Riddell> ah go it
[17:27] <shadeslayer> heh :)
[17:29] <Riddell> seeing if anyone will volunteer for the updates petersaints wanted (or maybe petersaints will volunteer :)
[17:30] <yofel> I originally planned to do rekonq, but that has no hurry and would be good for someone new
[17:31] <Riddell> always a judgement call with new people, do you nudge them into doing a task or just do the task, let's see if they reply
[17:32] <Riddell> hmm, SC 4.10 tagging this week, that might clash with me running away to fosdem
[17:33] <ScottK> libktorrent and ktorrent need updating.  New packages are in Debian experimental.
[17:33] <yofel> tagging is thursday and shouldn't be too much work, we can handle tha
[17:39] <petersaints> Riddell: I'd gladly help. And I really would like to contribute do Kubuntu. But I'm quite busy right now finishing an important assignment. Once I have some free time I really want to learn how to use PPAs (I have been postponing it :P).
[17:40] <Riddell> petersaints: great :)  just ping when you have time and chance are someone will be around
[17:42] <petersaints> ok Riddell
[17:45] <Riddell> xnox: is there a channel for nexus7 chat?
[17:46] <xnox> Riddell: #ubuntu-arm

[18:04] <Riddell> vassie: hmm, on running it I get
[18:04] <Riddell> "You are not currently a member of the "users" group. Cantata will function better (saving of album covers, lyrics, etc. with the correct permissions) if you (or your administrator) add yourself to this group."
[18:04] <Tm_T> with "| <the target> needs testing
[18:04] <Riddell> Tm_T: for libav* ?
[18:04] <Tm_T> I mean when doing testers call, pipe it and add reason
[18:04] <Riddell> aah
[18:04] <Tm_T> so the hilight contain why people are hilighted (:
[18:05] <Riddell> well a smarty guy like you should be able to look at two lines before :)
[18:05] <Tm_T> ofcourse
[18:05] <Riddell> vassie: what's it trying to do? "Failed to send command to Default (localhost:6600) - not connected"
[18:05] <Tm_T> just something that sometimes make finding the information much quicker
[18:16] <xnox> !testers | <vassie> hello, i've packaged cantata (kde mpd client) and uploaded it to my ppa https://launchpad.net/~vassie/+archive/ppa, i would be greatful for some feedback, thanks
[18:16] <xnox> that clearly did not work +)
[18:16] <Riddell> maybe nobody tested ubottu 
[18:21] <vassie> hello, it's an mpd client, you need to be using mpd https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPD
[18:21] <vassie> Riddell: the "users" issue is weird, the dev says it was developed on kubuntu
[18:22] <Riddell> vassie: does he say why it should be run with a user added to that group?
[18:22] <vassie> Riddell: even on Arch, what has the users group, i get the same message
[18:22] <vassie> Riddell: no idea, still runs fine mind you
=== jessie_ is now known as jessie
[18:27] <vassie> Riddell: "Cantata is developed on Kubuntu/Ubuntu." from the dev over at http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Cantata?content=147733
[18:28] <vassie> Riddell: i've logged an issue with the dev
[19:31] <vassie> Riddell: i've emailed the dev as i cannot find it documented anywhere why cantata wants me to be in the "users" group
[19:31] <vassie> Riddell: if cantata is insistant on us being in that group, where do I go from here?
[19:39] <vassie> Riddell: from the creator "When cantata downloads images, or lyrics, and these are saved into the MPD folders - if the user is a member of the "users" group, the files will be set to belong to this group. Therefore if you have two users, they can each save files here, etc. Likewise, when copying files from devices, the files will be set to be owned by the "users" group."
