[09:16] <shadeslayer> afiestas: we have the latest release 1.1.5, unless something changed in the last 24 hours
[09:20] <shadeslayer> otoh I could setup a daily recipe, but the packaging is spooky

[09:36] <shadeslayer> fun
[09:36] <shadeslayer> calligra is slightly broken
[09:36] <shadeslayer> good thing I didn't send this email to KDE Devel
[09:37]  * shadeslayer goes off to fix
[10:28] <yofel_> shadeslayer: in my next upgrade test kdm worked fine, but this time the wallpaper didn't get changed to Elarun... otherwise everything works fine
[10:29] <yofel_> shadeslayer: one thing: if you want print-manager installed you'll have to add an updated version of kubuntu-meta
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[10:30] <shadeslayer> re Elarun that should be fixed I think
[10:31] <yofel> I thought so too, but it did happen just now.
[10:32] <shadeslayer> don't remember where the fix was supposed to be
[10:33] <shadeslayer> ah yes
[10:33] <shadeslayer> yofel: /usr/share/kde4/apps/desktoptheme/default/metadata.desktop
[10:33] <shadeslayer> should say : [Wallpaper]
[10:33] <shadeslayer> defaultWallpaperTheme=Elarun
[10:33] <shadeslayer> defaultFileSuffix=.png
[10:33] <shadeslayer> defaultWidth=2560
[10:33] <shadeslayer> defaultHeight=1600
[10:34] <shadeslayer> note the dimensions
[10:35] <Riddell> kdm uses /etc/kde4/kdm/kdmrc
[10:35] <Riddell> the wallpaper needs to be upgraded manually I think
[10:35] <shadeslayer> *facepalm* you're right
[10:35] <Riddell> or by a script
[10:35] <shadeslayer> the one I pasted before was for the screenlocker
[10:35] <yofel> hm, I thought we were defaulting the wallpaper to our kde-default.png symlink?
[10:36] <yofel> (which makes the wallpaper appear twice in the settings btw.)
[10:38] <shadeslayer> ^
[10:39] <shadeslayer> I worked around this in Netrunner by putting it in /usr/share/netrunner ... we could put the symlink in /usr/share/kubuntu-settings-desktop
[10:41] <yofel> sounds good to me, now it's just an image called "2560x1600" which is ugly
[10:42] <yofel> I wonder what uses that image though
[10:42] <shadeslayer> ubiquity
[10:42] <yofel> ah
[10:42] <shadeslayer> review plz : http://paste.kde.org/642500/
[10:44] <yofel> wth is up with hidden folders in /usr o.O? usr/share/templates/.source/
[10:44] <shadeslayer> heh, don't ask me
[10:44] <yofel> ack otherwise
[10:45] <shadeslayer> but there were 2 bugs, one that template files get pulled in even tho the app is not installed
[10:45] <shadeslayer> and if you try to hide the app using NoDisplay=true it won't work
[10:45] <shadeslayer> fix for the second one is here : http://www.davidfaure.fr/2013/knewfilemenu.cpp.diff
[10:45] <yofel> hm
[10:49] <shadeslayer> yofel: do kubuntu-dev have upload rights for calligra?
[10:50] <yofel> yes
[10:50] <shadeslayer> ah cool
[10:51]  * yofel wonders how he managed to break upower... AC is in, upower says it's offline
[10:52] <Quintasan_> Sigh 
=== Quintasan_ is now known as Quintasan
[10:53] <Quintasan> Hopefully I passed
[10:53] <yofel> that bad?
[10:53] <yofel> ^^
[10:53] <Quintasan> Not as bad as I expected it to be
[10:53] <Quintasan> but not entirely good
[10:54] <Quintasan> multivariable deriviatives are not what I expected
[10:54] <Quintasan> and I am not sure if I got them right
[10:54] <Quintasan> plus integrals and ofc I didnt even touch those
[10:55] <Quintasan> I have a second attempt but I would like to think the first attempt was enough
[10:55] <Quintasan> Will see next week, tomorrow is logic.
[10:56] <yofel> second attempt is good... but believe me, you usually don't have time to study for that...
[10:56] <Quintasan> yes
[10:56] <Quintasan> especially I have like. 4 tests next week?
[10:56]  * Quintasan takes a break and goes back to studying
[10:56]  * yofel passes Quintasan a cup of coffee
[10:58] <Quintasan> welp
[10:58] <Quintasan> I think I have lecture to attend in like an hour
[10:58] <Quintasan> gotta pack some stuff and head to that
[11:01] <shadeslayer> hahaha
[11:02] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: now you understand why I had tests all the time for the last 4 years :P
[11:03] <yofel> he's getting there :P
[11:15] <Riddell> meh, anyone got any great ideas why qt isn't compiling on arm and powerpc
[11:15] <Riddell> arm complains about no QtGui which is weird
[11:15] <Riddell> powerpc complains about QtWebKit which is not unusual but no reason why it would be platform specific
[11:33] <kubotu> ::qt-bugs:: [1098136] package libqtcore4 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.3 failed to install/upgrade: conffile './etc/xdg/Troll... @ https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1098136 (by Amit Kumar)
[11:34] <shadeslayer> and now calligra has failed because /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lnepomukcore
[11:36] <Riddell> well it compiled when I uploaded it :)
[11:36] <Riddell> needs to build-dep on nepomuk-core-dev?
[11:36] <vHanda> calligra uses Nepomuk?
[11:36] <Riddell> yes it doesn't have that
[11:37] <Riddell> vHanda: seems so
[11:37] <Riddell> ./CMakeLists.txt:    macro_log_feature(NEPOMUK_FOUND "Nepomuk" "Handles metadata of resources" FALSE  "Required to handle metadata of resources")
[11:37] <shadeslayer> Riddell: that's what I'm thinking as well :P
[11:37] <Riddell> ./libs/widgets/CMakeLists.txt:    target_link_libraries(kowidgets kotext pigmentcms ${NEPOMUK_LIBRARIES} ${SOPRANO_LIBRARIES})
[11:38] <vHanda> hmm, they seem to have basic tag support
[11:38] <vHanda> but that is kdelibs/nepomuk not nepomukcore
[11:38] <vHanda> ( as of Sept 12 2012 )
[11:39] <shadeslayer> vHanda: I have a suspicion it's because of http://paste.kde.org/642524/
[11:40] <vHanda> that's kdepim
[11:40] <shadeslayer> should kdepimlibs-dev depend on nepomuk-core-dev ?
[11:40] <shadeslayer> yes
[11:40] <vHanda> if they use nepomuk-core (which I think they do) then yes
[11:41] <shadeslayer> okay
[11:41] <yofel> vHanda: as I'm a bit confused after the last discussion about it, is the presence of nepomuk-widgets implied if nepomuk-core is there?
[11:42] <vHanda> nepomuk-widgets cannot be compiled with nepomuk-core
[11:42] <vHanda> it also won't work (runtime) without nepomuk-core
[11:42] <vHanda> so it has a compile time and runtime dependency to nepomuk-core
[11:43] <vHanda> *cannot be compiled WITHOUT nepomuk-core
[11:43] <vHanda> sorry
[11:43] <vHanda> I should proof read what I write
[11:43] <shadeslayer> alright
[11:43] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I'll go ahead and add a nepomuk-core-dev dep to kdepimlibs-dev
[11:44] <Riddell> shadeslayer: go ahead but that might not do much if you're looking at calligra :)
[11:44] <yofel> vHanda: ah, I was remembering the dolphin build failure because the cmake check for nepomuk-widgets was missing
[11:44] <shadeslayer> Riddell: yeah, let's see, I'm compiling by adding nepomuk-core-dev to calligra 
[11:44] <vHanda> yofel: right. I fixed that
[11:44] <vHanda> but not in time for RC2
[11:45] <yofel> thanks
[11:45] <vHanda> yofel: http://commits.kde.org/kde-baseapps/da5b7dcde4b5bbef28600e31ebb540d7f182050b
[11:46] <yofel> shadeslayer: it'll build fine with nepomuk-core-dev, already tried it when I attempted to backport it to precise
[11:46] <shadeslayer> ah
[11:46] <yofel> vHanda: ah, perfect. Thanks
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[11:49] <shadeslayer> Riddell: if I add nepomuk-core-dev to kdepimlibs5-dev it'll get pulled in automagically when building calligra
[11:49] <shadeslayer> as well as other stuff
[11:52] <Riddell> really?  why does calligra use kdepimlibs?
[11:54] <shadeslayer>    * KDE PIM iCalendar - KDE Personal Information Management iCalendar Libraries
[11:59] <oy> what is the best way to provide KolorServer to kubuntu for KWin-4.10 colour correction?
[12:03]  * shadeslayer looks
[12:04] <Riddell> oy: I'm not sure what you're asking there
[12:04] <Riddell> oy: you're the upstream for KolorServer?
[12:04] <oy> yes, nearly
[12:04] <shadeslayer> https://projects.kde.org/projects/extragear/graphics/kolor-manager/repository
[12:04] <Riddell> nearly? :)
[12:05] <shadeslayer> that would need packaging I guess :)
[12:05] <oy> KWin-4.10 needs KolorServer to enable ICC colour correction
[12:05] <Riddell> oy: is there a release of KolorServer?
[12:05] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I've uploaded pimlibs with dep on nepomuk-core-dev :)
[12:06] <oy> Riddell, and shadeslayer yes we have packages
[12:06] <oy> https://www.oyranos.org/kolormanager/   on the bottom
[12:07] <shadeslayer> Should I trust the SSL cert? :P
[12:08] <shadeslayer> oy: I don't see a proper release
[12:08] <oy> KolorServer is part of KolorManager and both use ICC Examin + Oyranos + libXcm all inofficially packaged for debian
[12:09] <oy> shadeslayer, https://projects.kde.org/news/192 ?
[12:09] <Riddell> oy: presumably it needs packages of Oyranos first?
[12:09] <shadeslayer> yeah, I was about to open that link on projects.kde.org
[12:10] <shadeslayer> Riddell: yep : FIND_PACKAGE(Oyranos REQUIRED)
[12:10] <oy> Riddell, the dependencies are all packaged in the same way
[12:11] <oy> you can find the package list under xUbuntu: https://build.opensuse.org/project/monitor?project=multimedia%3Acolor_management
[12:13] <shadeslayer> I don't think we can use that packagign
[12:13] <shadeslayer> *packaging
[12:14] <oy> oh, why? I made it to help for Debian and Ubuntu
[12:15] <oy> shadeslayer, what can be done to improve?
[12:15] <shadeslayer> because it has a different format to what is actual packaging? IIRC OBS has this flat heiarchy packaging which is not valid debian packaging
[12:15] <shadeslayer> *actual debian packaging
[12:15] <apachelogger> (can be made actual debian packaging depending on how OBSy the packaging is...)
[12:16] <oy> I used a debian packaging tutorial
[12:16] <Riddell> shadeslayer: it seems like a good start
[12:16] <Riddell> oy: how much does this conflict with colord?
[12:17] <shadeslayer> OBS confuses me as hell
[12:17] <oy> I had them both running side by side, did not uninstall colord, works
[12:17] <shadeslayer> I don't even know where the packaging is so I can have a look
[12:18] <oy> shadeslayer, https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=kolor-manager&project=multimedia%3Acolor_management
[12:18] <oy> shadeslayer, you can click the package name in the monitor list
[12:18] <oy> agreed, it is different to launchpad
[12:21] <shadeslayer> looks sane from an overview, except that the copyright needs fixing ( 80 char width _
[12:21] <shadeslayer> *)
[12:21] <oy> will do, thanks
[12:22] <shadeslayer> I didn't know that OBS accepted this format
[12:22] <shadeslayer> I was only aware of the flat hiearchy one
[12:22] <oy> shadeslayer, I saw as well other formats, but because of the debian tutorial I choose that one
[12:22] <apachelogger> it is flat too :P
[12:23] <shadeslayer> oy: oh and maybe you can use dh $@ --with kde
[12:23] <oy> ok
[12:23] <shadeslayer> and remove the sample cruft in there as well
[12:24] <oy> shadeslayer, sample cruft? in which file?
[12:25] <shadeslayer> debian/rules
[12:25] <shadeslayer> "# Sample debian/rules that uses debhelper."
[12:25] <shadeslayer> not needed :)
[12:25] <oy> ah, see it, good
[12:27] <Riddell> oy: out of these packages in that OBS archive you're saying we want oyranos and kolor-manager in kubuntu?
[12:28] <oy> Riddell, yes, these + libXcm (dep) + ICC Examin (optionally used by KolorManager)
[12:29] <oy> "icc-profiles-free" is already in wheezy and I guess "xcalib" is available too, both are dependencies too
[12:30] <Riddell> oy: as someone who knows nothing about colour correction can you tell me why a window manager needs it?  isn't it better done for the whole monitor?
[12:31] <oy> Riddell, the WM manages all monitors, so it is ICC colour correction for the whole monitor
[12:32] <oy> Riddell, in the past we (X11) had only 1D LUT correction, which means no opt out, colorimetric based correction only for ICC supporting apps
[12:33] <oy> in the old LUT way, Dolphin does no colorimetric correction why DigiKam/Krita etc. do
[12:34] <oy> Riddell, with KWin ICC colour correction all apps are corrected together, including video on the GPU
[12:35] <oy> in the old LUT way, Dolphin does no colorimetric correction *while* DigiKam/Krita etc. do
[12:35] <Tm_T> oy: is the colour correction per-display?
[12:35] <oy> Tm_T, per output
[12:35] <oy> alias per monitor
[12:36] <Tm_T> oh good
[12:36] <Tm_T> so I have some hope to get reasonable results with external monitor and laptop
[12:37] <Riddell> oy: how is this different from colord-kde applying a profile to a monitor?
[12:37] <oy> Tm_T: yes that is one use case
[12:38] <oy> Riddell, colord-kde does only calibration, which is a 1D LUT
[12:39] <oy> Riddell, it does no correction for different primaries or saturation, calibration helps only in improving gray ramps, but that is covered by ICC profiles in KWin as well
[12:40] <oy> the 1D Lut this is very long available (perhaps 10 years). xcalib can do that for instance
[12:42] <oy> a calibration does not so much for small gamut laptops + attached sRGB/wide Gamut external monitors
[12:43] <Tm_T> ^
[12:44] <Riddell> oy: no 1.0 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/oyranos/files/Oyranos/ ?
[12:45] <oy> Riddell, not yet, we are still in beta and expect some minor changes
[12:45] <oy> btw. colord is guessedly beta too or alpha
[12:46] <Riddell> oy: but the OBS archive does have 1.0.0?
[12:46] <oy> Riddell, yes, of KolorManager, but not of its dependencies
[12:47] <Riddell> oh I see
[12:47] <oy> KolorManager exposes a limited set of features, we think we can garantee to remain stable
[12:47] <Riddell> oy: where's the place to download KolorManager sources?
[12:47] <oy> the Oyranos geature set is much broader
[12:48] <oy> Riddell, we hoped that git snapshots are fine? http://quickgit.kde.org/index.php?p=kolor-manager.git&a=tags
[12:49] <oy> for most of other packages there is: http://sourceforge.net/projects/oyranos/files/
[12:51] <Riddell> oy: that not quite kosher, KolorManager is ment to be 1.0 and stable but there's no tars?
[12:51] <Darkwing> Morning guys
[12:51] <oy> hmm, need to find a place for that
[12:52] <Riddell> oy: you can use ftp.kde.org or the same sourceforge project as oyranos no?
[12:52] <oy> ftp.kde.org would be sound
[12:53] <Riddell> oy: ask in #kde-sysadmin how you do that, I think you need to upload it somewhere then file a request on bugs.kde.org for sysadmin to move it to release
[12:53] <oy> ah, good to know
[12:55] <Riddell> oy: where is the GUI in kwin for this?
[12:55]  * oy works on the fixes and pushes a new tar ball
[12:56] <apachelogger> yes, upload to incoming, then file a sysamind request to move it to ftpmaster containing target path and the sha1 of the tarball
[12:58] <oy> Riddell, http://userbase.kde.org/Color_Management/en
[12:59] <oy> the enabling of colour correction happens inside KWin effect dialog, it is for the first release experimental
[13:05] <Riddell> oy: groovy thanks for answering my questions, I'll look into getting it packaged and in the archive
[13:07] <oy> Riddell, thanks, meanwhile I will work on a kolor-manager-1.0.1 release and proper upload

[15:01] <shadeslayer> sure
[15:02] <Quintasan> mfw I can do nothing for whole 10 months after 15 February
[15:03] <Riddell> what happens then?
[15:03] <apachelogger> Quintasan has tests for the next 10 months
[15:04] <apachelogger> it's the shadeslayer test schedule problem all over again
[15:04] <Quintasan> Riddell: Some tests and end of the year
[15:04] <Quintasan> Riddell: after that more free time
[15:04] <Riddell> that's some long tests

[15:05] <Quintasan> apachelogger: That won't be the case hopefully
[15:05] <Quintasan> If I pass all the tests next week I will have only ONE exam in February

[15:09] <apachelogger> it's another foremost topic when having coffee @ uni
[15:09] <Quintasan> If you know what the hell is going on then it is :P

[17:19] <Quintasan> <sandsmark> it still has some ugly regressions
[17:19] <Quintasan> NOW
[17:19] <Quintasan> this looks promising...
[17:24] <txwikinger> Wonder if someone could help me
[17:24] <txwikinger> On my panel.. my task manager is really small because the tray is using up too much space
[17:24] <txwikinger> Any idea how that can be fixed?
[17:33] <jessie> Quintasan: I cannot confirm the crash.
[17:33] <sbivol_> txwikinger: remove all the panels, then right-click the desktop and choose Add Panel -> Defaul panel
[17:34] <txwikinger> ok.. found the issue.. there are lots of useless entries in the tray settings... where did they come from?
[17:34] <jessie> Actually, I lied, Quintasan. With 4 images it didn't crash, with 200 it did.
[17:34] <txwikinger> sbivol_: Yeah.. that unfortuantely loses all my customizations
[17:36] <txwikinger> wonder what all those statusnotifieritems supposed to be!
[17:36] <Quintasan> jessie: With small number of elements is not a problem
[17:37] <Quintasan> I have 5 photos of my friend doing a kickflip,taggin them skateboarding was not a problem
[17:37] <Quintasan> but taggin 600 pictures from our skateboarding trip crashed the whole thing

[17:37] <txwikinger> :;;
[17:41] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: KDE does not scale
[17:41] <shadeslayer> we need to make it webscale
[17:42] <txwikinger> how do you scale a desktop shadeslayer?
[17:42] <shadeslayer> by using mongodb instead of mysql
[17:42] <shadeslayer> don't you know? mongodb is webscale
[17:42] <Quintasan> NoSQL?
[17:42] <Quintasan> Sounds good
[17:42] <Quintasan> vHanda: ^^
[17:43] <shadeslayer> No, Mongodb
[17:43] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: look at MongoDB page derp
[17:46] <txwikinger> Riddell.. do you know what all the statusnotifieritems in the system tray entries supposed to do?
[17:46] <Riddell> txwikinger: yeah, why do you have ones which are unclear?
[17:47] <txwikinger> yes.. in my laptop there are quite a bunch that start with numbers and do not mean anything
[17:47] <txwikinger> on the netbook there are none
[17:47] <txwikinger> of these
[17:48] <txwikinger> those funny entries make the trasy uneccessarry wide
[17:48] <txwikinger> I had to change them all to hidden to be able to see my task manager properly
[17:50] <txwikinger> Deleting them in the System Tray Settings UI does not seem to work
[17:52] <txwikinger> I believe they first appeared after a crash of plasma.. well the panel disppeared and came back a bit later
[17:53] <Riddell> my systray has a circular one with a number in it which is for downloads and notificatios
[17:53] <Riddell> otherwise I don't know why one would have a number
[17:54] <txwikinger> :1.112/org/kde/statusnotifieritem/1
[17:54] <txwikinger> that is one example of it
[18:07] <txwikinger> Well. I found something in the KDE forum.. seems to be a kdelibs bug
[18:17] <shadeslayer> yofel: did you do an announce on kubuntu.org?
[18:25] <Riddell> shadeslayer: should be added to the existing 4.9.97 one
[18:25] <Riddell> hi skaet!
[18:25] <shadeslayer> Riddell: okay
[18:25] <shadeslayer> I'll do it before sleeping
[18:26] <skaet> hiya Riddell!
[18:26] <skaet> :)
[18:27]  * shadeslayer waves to skaet
[18:27] <Riddell> skaet: happy new year
[18:28]  * skaet waves back to shadeslayer
[18:28] <skaet> happy new year,  Riddell
[18:29]  * skaet glad to be back online again 
[18:35] <yofel> shadeslayer: thanks, I didn't as I left the office right after that
[18:35]  * yofel wonders if kmail would be faster if akonadi used NoSQL
[19:23] <rbelem> é o weechat
[19:25] <shadeslayer> oh look an rbelem
[19:26] <rbelem> :-D
[19:26] <rbelem> wrong channel
[19:26] <shadeslayer> hahaha
[19:26] <shadeslayer> so kubuntu-devel is now a 'wrong' channel for you eh 
[19:26] <shadeslayer> hiding from us
[19:35] <shadeslayer> hmm
[19:36] <shadeslayer> seem to get this slight issue with the new SNA stuff http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/10/plasma-desktopS17003.png
[19:36] <shadeslayer> wasn't getting this earlier

[20:17] <JontheEchidna> shadeslayer: mfw UXA was supposed to fix all of the bugs of EXA
[20:17] <shadeslayer> rofl
[20:18] <JontheEchidna> shadeslayer: I have intel, but not a sandybridge cpu
[20:19] <shadeslayer> JontheEchidna: yeah I'm slightly confused as well, do people with non-sandybridge arch's get the same perf improvements?
[20:19] <shadeslayer> maybe ask in #ubuntu-x ?
[20:19] <JontheEchidna> I'll test it in a bit
[20:19] <shadeslayer> cool
[20:20] <JontheEchidna> gives me a nice excuse to play minecraft :P
[20:20] <shadeslayer> lol
[20:20]  * shadeslayer is still upgrading
[20:21] <shadeslayer> updated steam \o/

[20:22]  * sreich strolls in with his ivy bridge and gtx 670 ;p
[20:22] <sreich> oh yeah, i'm bad
[20:22] <shadeslayer> xD
[20:23] <shadeslayer> sreich: go test new stuff 
[20:23] <shadeslayer> go go go
[20:23] <shadeslayer> you get to play TF2
[20:24] <sreich> lol
[20:24] <sreich> of course
[20:24] <shadeslayer> oh wow
[20:24] <shadeslayer> shift + tab works
[20:24] <shadeslayer> didn't work earlier
[20:25] <shadeslayer> as does big picture
[20:25] <shadeslayer> whoop
[20:34] <snele> guys, does anybody knows irc nickname of the guy how redisigned plasma theme for 4.10? mart? notmart? marco? something else? :)
[20:34] <snele> *who
[20:34] <shadeslayer> hmm
[20:35] <shadeslayer> there's notmart
[20:35] <shadeslayer> but I don't think he did the redesign
[20:35] <shadeslayer> it was Nuno iirc
[20:35] <snele> I think it is notmart: http://www.notmart.org/index.php/Graphics/Time_to_refresh_some_air
[20:36] <shadeslayer> well both of them
[20:37] <shadeslayer> so you want to talk to pinheiro and notmart
[20:37] <shadeslayer> #oxygen probably
[20:39] <snele> shadeslayer: thanks! they are both in #oxygen :)
[20:40] <JontheEchidna> Well X still works
[20:40] <snele> they introduces regression with new theme in icon-only task manager so I have to ping them :)
[20:41] <shadeslayer> heh
[20:41] <shadeslayer> yofel: "Update: Packages for Precise users are now avaliable via the same Beta PPA mentioned above."
[20:41] <shadeslayer> good enough?
[20:41] <shadeslayer> or should I add the word awesome in there
[20:44]  * shadeslayer removes the word 'same'
[20:53] <shadeslayer> poor buildd's
[20:53] <shadeslayer> I get this when building qtcreator : http://paste.kde.org/643058/
[20:56] <JontheEchidna> hmm, I'm seeing some font artifacting in Chrome with this SNA stuff
[20:57] <JontheEchidna> on its tabbar
[20:57] <shadeslayer> dunno, no such thing here

[21:48] <Mamarok> dear Kubuntu devs, it would be really great if we could get debugging symbols for taglib
[21:54] <Riddell> Mamarok: use dbgsym packages?  they get made for everything
[21:55] <Mamarok> hm, what is that? never heard of
[21:55] <Riddell> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash
[21:55] <Riddell> see "If there is no -dbg package:"
[21:56] <Mamarok> *sigh* and you really expect me to ask the average user to do that?
[21:57] <Mamarok> looks complicated even to me
[21:57] <Mamarok> apparently just rebuilding taglib from source with debug enabled seems much easier than that
[21:59] <Mamarok> and then it has to be removed again?
[21:59] <Mamarok> not user friendly at all, and the bug reports we get for taglib are from plain users
[21:59] <Mamarok> too complicated
[22:00] <mikhas> option b) contribute to a project with no users → no complaints
[22:00] <mikhas> SCNR
[22:00] <Mamarok> mikhas: well, lukily Amarok has a lot of users, much better that way :)
[22:01] <mikhas> but you just complained about having users, in a way ;-)
[22:01] <yofel> adding that automatically was a feature request for our debug installer, but last time we talked JT said it's not exactly trivial
[22:01] <yofel> I'll agree that this system is designed for apport's auto-retracer, not for human beings
[22:02] <mikhas> so, find someone to fix taglib packaging to create a *--dbg package?
[22:03] <Riddell> I think that's what Mamarok just asked for
[22:03] <mikhas> yes
[22:04] <Riddell> but is -dbgsym really so hard? it's just running a couple of copy and paste commands
[22:04] <Mamarok> Riddell: maybe not for us, but I talk about plain users
[22:04] <mikhas> I just dont think that being cynical when asking for others to do something for you helps.
[22:05] <Mamarok> mikhas: and you are talking to whom?
[22:05] <yofel> hm...
[22:06] <yofel> Riddell: how about adding a shell scrip for that to kubuntu-debug-installer and have it run it when it's not enabled? (finding that out would be the hard part I guess)
[22:06] <yofel> stupid t buton
[22:07] <Riddell> I don't understand why it isn't enabled by default
[22:08] <yofel> "people should use apport"
[22:09] <shadeslayer> huh
[22:10] <shadeslayer> I don't suppose we can somehow ship with that repo added
[22:11] <yofel> hm, wait
[22:11] <yofel> can add-apt-repository prevent adding the same repo twice?
[22:12] <shadeslayer> I think so
[22:13] <shadeslayer> ah nope
[22:13] <yofel> JontheEchidna: is there some qapt method to check whether a specific repository is enabled on a system?
[22:14] <yofel> apt should know the list of active repositories from the cache...

[22:18] <yofel> shadeslayer: huh, since when is steam for linux public o.O?
[22:18] <shadeslayer> a long long time
[22:19] <yofel> I meant public as in visible on the default install page
[22:19] <shadeslayer> default install page?
[22:19] <yofel> http://store.steampowered.com/about/
[22:20] <shadeslayer> neato
[22:21] <shadeslayer> they're pushing towards a Linux console
[22:21] <shadeslayer> probably that's why
