[05:07] <shadeslayer> I rage quit last night, got too annoyed :P
[05:08] <shadeslayer> next UDS in Oakland, CA
[05:35] <ScottK> I'm as excited about going there again as I was the first time.
[05:40] <shadeslayer> I'm guessing that code for "Not alot"
[05:40] <shadeslayer> *thats
[05:43] <ScottK> Yes.
[06:31] <phoenix_firebrd> hello everyone
[06:32] <shadeslayer> hi phoenix_firebrd
[06:32] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: good morning
[06:32] <shadeslayer> good morning to you as well :)
[06:38] <shadeslayer> who can test some precise stuff?
[06:39] <shadeslayer> X fails on precise when using qemu :(
[06:39] <shadeslayer> and bug 1093220 needs verification
[06:39] <ubottu> bug 1093220 in transmission (Ubuntu Quantal) "[SRU] Fix transmission-qt to open magnet links from a browser" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1093220
[09:12] <Noskcaj> ScottK, bug 1066225 has a new comment for you
[09:12] <ubottu> bug 1066225 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "encrypt home folder needs to be checkbox not radio button" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1066225
[09:29] <shadeslayer> does it make sense to encrypt the home folder and have autologin enabled?
[09:30] <shadeslayer> I mean, the entire point of having encrypted data is that if someone gains physical access to your machine your data is safe ( assuming they cannot crack the key )
[09:33] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: in that case using kwallet is also vulnerable 
[09:33] <shadeslayer> not exactly, your kwallet password is not associated with your login password
[09:34]  * shadeslayer uses crazy levels of encryption
[09:35] <shadeslayer> I have full disk encryption as well as /home encryption setup
[09:36] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  ya, thats right, but why kwallet manager doesnt seek password when kwallet was opened previously for other use
[09:36] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: I dont encrypt my disk , because i am afraid i may not be able to recover data in case of a filesystem error
[09:37] <shadeslayer> yep, that's a huge issue
[09:37] <shadeslayer> which is why, unencrypted backups
[09:37] <shadeslayer> which travel with me :P
[09:37] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thats a vulnerability :) 
[09:38] <shadeslayer> I know :)
[09:38] <shadeslayer> the biggest risk is my ssh and gpg keys, which do not have a backup
[09:38] <shadeslayer> primarily because I have no good way to back them up
[09:38] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: "donot ask password" for screen locker is not working?
[09:38] <shadeslayer> whut
[09:41] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: is the new screen locker working for you?
[09:41] <shadeslayer> sure
[09:41] <shadeslayer> ctrl-alt-l locks the screen
[09:41] <shadeslayer> that's about all I tested
[09:41] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: does it ask for the password everytime?
[09:41] <shadeslayer> well
[09:42] <shadeslayer> that's intended behaviour
[09:42] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: no
[09:42] <shadeslayer> I specifically asked it to lock the screen, so it should ask my password
[09:42] <shadeslayer> what else would it do
[09:43] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: "the option require password after" is disabled for me and it asks for the password after i immediately try to unlock 
[09:43] <phoenix_firebrd> let me confirm it one more time
[09:44] <shadeslayer> where is this option? 0..o

[09:44] <phoenix_firebrd> screen locker
[09:45] <yofel> oh, they renamed the menu
[09:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: inside display and monitor settings
[09:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i am using 12.10
[09:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: hi
[09:45] <yofel> hey
[09:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: today 4.10 sc tagging?
[09:46] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: anyway, I did notice there was somthing funky about that menu
[09:46] <shadeslayer> I have no idea where this kcm is
[09:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: menu?
[09:46] <shadeslayer> give me the kcm module name
[09:46] <yofel> shadeslayer: no idea, but it's in the display settings 
[09:46] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: can the see the display and monitor settings?
[09:47] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: well, that was the screensaver kcm before
[09:47] <shadeslayer> this ? http://i.imgur.com/BHRRto0.png
[09:47] <yofel> right
[09:47] <yofel> disable the 2nd checkbox
[09:47] <yofel> I think it has no effect
[09:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thats it
[09:47] <yofel> or at least it doesn't work reliably
[09:47] <shadeslayer> funny thing
[09:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the second options is the one i am talking about
[09:47] <shadeslayer> click "Screen Saver"
[09:47] <yofel> but I know they fixed a bunch of locker issues recently
[09:48] <shadeslayer> and the monitor turns blue
[09:48] <shadeslayer> click "Simple locker" and it stays blue
[09:48] <yofel> true o.O
[09:48] <shadeslayer> heheh
[09:48] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-cvs-announce/2013/000105.html
[09:48] <shadeslayer> iirc tagging freeze is in effect no?
[09:48] <yofel> so work starts tomorrow
[09:49] <yofel> I'll fire the cronjob up later for the stats
[09:49] <yofel> it is
[09:49] <yofel> shadeslayer: but who cares about it?
[09:49] <shadeslayer> well
[09:49] <shadeslayer> tsdegos got pissed when I merged to okular extractor
[09:49] <shadeslayer> so I'm not going to piss him off again :P
[09:49] <shadeslayer> I'll just file a bug
[09:49] <yofel> heh
[09:50] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[09:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: In case my project is using automake i wont be needing to add rules for clean, build and install in debian/rules right?
[09:56] <yofel> ok wait, I'll elaborate on that
[09:57] <yofel> you know how gnu make works? (roughly?)
[09:57] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: cmake configures with the make files and make buuilds the project with that
[09:57] <shadeslayer> what was the Product for the screenlocker again :|
[09:57] <phoenix_firebrd> :)
[09:57] <yofel> shadeslayer: kscreensaver I believe
[09:58] <shadeslayer> thx
[09:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: ok, so let's talk about make first
[09:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[09:58] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: make is originally meant for building source code. It's usefullness comes from being able to determine what files have changed and only rebuilding what needs to be built
[09:59] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[09:59] <yofel> it does that by defining make "targets" that have dependencies and commands that are needed to build it
[09:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: wait
[09:59] <phoenix_firebrd> targets is key waord?
[10:00] <phoenix_firebrd> targets is key word?
[10:00] <yofel> no
[10:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the output?
[10:00] <yofel> a target is something like:
[10:00] <yofel> targetname: dep
[10:00] <yofel>                   commandlist
[10:00] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: give me an example
[10:01] <shadeslayer> done, kde bug 314122
[10:01] <ubottu> KDE bug 314122 in locker "Monitor is not turned 'off'" [Normal,Confirmed] http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=314122
[10:01] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: http://paste.kde.org/659828
[10:02] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so to build the "build" target, the configure target has to be finished
[10:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[10:03] <yofel> now, the reason I run "touch" there, is because usually the targets are the filenames of the source you want to build
[10:03] <yofel> so if a file changes, it's target and all targets that depend on it will run
[10:03] <yofel> that's how make works... roughly
[10:03] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: doubt
[10:03] <yofel> hm?
[10:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: if you say that this is the label that points to build "build:" then what does this do "DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET:" ?
[10:05] <yofel> what's DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET?
[10:05] <yofel> just going by make syntax, DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET would be the name of the target
[10:06] <yofel> i.e. the name would literally be "DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET"
[10:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can you pulll-lp tomboy-blogposter
[10:07] <yofel> oh, :=, that's a variable definition, but we'll come to that ^ example in a bit
[10:07] <yofel> now back to rules
[10:07] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok'
[10:08] <shadeslayer> hehehe
[10:08] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/pro/grannies.pdf
[10:08] <yofel> shadeslayer: o.O (I'll read it later...)
[10:09] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: in US too?
[10:09] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: it's a worldwide phenomenon
[10:09] <phoenix_firebrd> ha ha ha
[10:09] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so, as making deb packages is a slighly complex process, we have a program called debhelper with perl scripts called dh_* that does most of the work for us
[10:09] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[10:10] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: back in dh 6 and early 7 days, a rules file would look like this: http://paste.kde.org/659858
[10:10]  * shadeslayer is scared to click that link
[10:10] <yofel> which is gnu make taken too perfection
[10:10] <shadeslayer> oh heh
[10:10] <yofel> shadeslayer: it's a clean rules file, nothing scary ;)
[10:10] <shadeslayer> btw you should show him a cdbs file
[10:10] <yofel> shadeslayer: that's next
[10:10] <shadeslayer> :D
[10:10] <yofel> shadeslayer: as his example above uses that :P
[10:11] <shadeslayer> I joined just as cdbs was dying
[10:11] <shadeslayer> trolololol
[10:11] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so, as you can see it's not really the most easiest, not the most readable way of doing it
[10:11] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: + you had to be very careful to not mistake the sequencing
[10:11] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: to help with that people went and wrote supplementary build systems, like cdbs
[10:12] <phoenix_firebrd> came across that
[10:12] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: if you look at your tomboy rules, you'll see that it has include /usr/share/cdbs/1/rules/...
[10:12] <yofel> so it uses cdbs
[10:12] <shadeslayer> ScottK: your sync is bad : https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pyside/1.1.2-1
[10:12] <phoenix_firebrd> wait, checking
[10:12] <shadeslayer> makes pyside completely disappear for some reason
[10:12] <yofel> the advantage: the sequencing is done in the build system, and you just have to set some configuration variables like DEB_MAKE_BUILD_TARGET
[10:13] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: which makes rules a lot simpler as you can see
[10:14] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[10:14] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: where to specify the type of build system/version i am using
[10:15] <yofel> by "include"-ing the buildsystem makefile you want to use
[10:15] <yofel> now, next
[10:15] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[10:16] <yofel> since debhelper 7.0.51 or whatever, debhelper got it's own auto-sequencer called "dh", which is what's most people use today
[10:16] <jussi> argh
[10:17] <phoenix_firebrd> those are perl scripts right?
[10:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ^
[10:17] <yofel> ah wait, a bit of clarification
[10:17] <jussi> consistent LO crashing, and calligra screws up the formatting :(
[10:17] <yofel> even cdbs used those scripts
[10:17] <yofel> it's just the content of the makefile that you saw above ^
[10:18] <yofel> that was moved to the build system, so you don't need to write the build: install: etc. targets
[10:18] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[10:18] <yofel> debhelper provided the dh_install, dh_auto_configure, and whatever else scripts
[10:18] <yofel> and it does today too
[10:19] <yofel> with dh7, we gained a "dh" script, which does the sequencing of the rules file inside debhelper
[10:19] <yofel> so most rules file's today look like this: http://paste.kde.org/659864
[10:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so if i am not using cdbs i dont need install: build: .. in rules ?
[10:19] <yofel> if you use cdbs you don't need it
[10:19] <yofel> the long rules example I showed above was a dh6 example without any build system
[10:20] <yofel> tomboy uses a cdbs file
[10:20] <yofel> http://paste.kde.org/659864 is modern dh7 style
[10:20] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: the version 0.4.4 changed to automake so the rules have to be updated , probably the cdbs have to be removed
[10:20] <yofel> not really, cdbs and automake are 2 different thigns
[10:21] <yofel> for now I'm not going to talk about autotools
[10:21] <yofel> back to dh7
[10:21] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this is the min that has to be in the rules file for the new type http://paste.kde.org/659864  ?
[10:21] <shadeslayer> \o/ objcopy:debian/firefox/usr/lib/firefox/libxul.so[.debug_info]: Memory exhausted
[10:22] <shadeslayer> I guess I'll just upload it to the PPA and fix
[10:22] <yofel> yes, unless you need adjustments for the package, that alone will already work
[10:22] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[10:22] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: so, as you saw in the dh6 example, rules was a long list of dh_* commands
[10:23] <yofel> in dh7, "dh" runs those commands, so we don't need to write them ourselves
[10:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: dh6= http://paste.kde.org/659858/ ?
[10:23] <yofel> yes
[10:23] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[10:23] <yofel> now, if we need to tell one of those commands that we need to do something different
[10:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: overriding ?
[10:23] <yofel> like, dh_clean needs to remove a few more files
[10:24] <yofel> we'll override the command right
[10:24] <yofel> like this: http://paste.kde.org/659870
[10:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: who decides what to be put in ch_clean, the original maintainer or the packager?
[10:25] <shadeslayer> yay
[10:25] <shadeslayer> I have more bandwidth now
[10:25] <yofel> that essentially replaces the "dh_auto_clean" command in dh, with the list of commands inside the override target
[10:25] <shadeslayer> 2 Mbps
[10:25] <phoenix_firebrd> *dh_clean
[10:25] <yofel> (that's why you're calling dh_auto_clean there too)
[10:25]  * shadeslayer downloads shank
[10:26] <yofel> an empty override_dh_auto_clean: target would simply disable dh_auto_clean
[10:26] <yofel> (we often do that for dh_auto_test ;) )
[10:26] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[10:26] <phoenix_firebrd> junk is a user variable?
[10:26] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: any packager that works on the package may change the rules file as needed
[10:27] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: well, it's something, maybe the program makefile creates it. but dh_auto_clean has a fixed pattern that it deletes
[10:27] <yofel> so if you need to remove anything else you need to tell it to
[10:28] <phoenix_firebrd> junk is a keyword?
[10:28] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: for packaging, you're free to change what you want, but if the package has a maintainer that's not you, do talk to that person/team whether your changes are fine and ask for a review
[10:28] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: no, junk is a filename, this is literally "rm junk" in your shell
[10:28] <yofel> inside a make target you define simply shell commands
[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> oh ok
[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[10:29] <yofel> type dh_<tab><tab> in your shell, you'll see all of the debhelper stuff
[10:29] <yofel> as those are simply exectuable perl scripts
[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> checking
[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> got a list
[10:29] <phoenix_firebrd> nice
[10:30] <yofel> ok, so that's the basics of rules that you see today, dh6 style is deprecated. If you don't need anything else use the simple dh7 style
[10:30] <phoenix_firebrd> so it is necessary to specify the debhelper version >=7  right?
[10:30] <yofel> if you still need something special that dh7 can't do, or is hard to use for, you another buildsystem
[10:31] <yofel> for example our KDE SC packages use the "dhmk" build system from pkg-kde-tools
[10:31] <phoenix_firebrd> what is script-kiddy?
[10:31] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: that, and you'll need to put the version of debhelper your packaging works with into debian/compat
[10:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: wait
[10:32] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: it's a script for translations stuff
[10:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[10:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[10:33] <phoenix_firebrd> what is debian/source/format for?
[10:33] <shadeslayer> read the manual :P
[10:33] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[10:34] <phoenix_firebrd> just this once, where can i specify the quilt version tghat i am using?
[10:34] <shadeslayer> you don't specify a quilt version
[10:34] <shadeslayer> quilt is version agnostic?
[10:35] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the tutor said something about that yesterday
[10:35] <phoenix_firebrd> let me check
[10:35] <shadeslayer> can you grab me a quote?
[10:36] <yofel> er, you don't need to do that these days usually
[10:36] <phoenix_firebrd> thats it ,its the debian/source/format
[10:36] <shadeslayer> ahhh
[10:36] <yofel> there is one release that needs a manual quilt dep for 3.0 quilt and where lintian throws a warning if the version is missing
[10:36] <shadeslayer> okay so there are 2 formats, native and quilt
[10:36]  * yofel passes the micro to shadeslayer
[10:37] <yofel> need to do something else for a while
[10:37] <shadeslayer> the format file is to specify which format dh will use
[10:37] <shadeslayer> micro? :P
[10:37] <yofel> keyboard
[10:37] <phoenix_firebrd> format of?
[10:37] <yofel> voice, whatever :P
[10:37] <shadeslayer> micro keyboard? 
[10:37] <shadeslayer> haha
[10:37] <yofel> lol
[10:39] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: format of source package
[10:39] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: format of the source package
[10:39] <yofel> anyway, dpkg-source manpage explains all formats too. (ignore 2.0, that's not used)
[10:39] <shadeslayer> :P
[10:40] <shadeslayer> "Also known as wig&pen."
[10:40] <shadeslayer> hehehe
[10:44] <jussi> So we are all aware the kde dalogs induce a nice LO crash? or was it only on 4.9.4 ? 
[10:44] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: are you working form a desktop or a laptop?
[10:44] <shadeslayer> laptop
[10:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ok
[10:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: does your pbuilder check for updates everytime?
[10:47] <yofel> yes
[10:48] <yofel> if you're really low on bandwidth you can disable that
[10:48] <yofel> remove the executable bit from the 2 apt hooks
[10:48] <yofel> but then remember to keep your raring pbuilder updated
[10:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: sure
[10:49] <apachelogger> yofel: do we have a kcm that is python3?
[10:50] <yofel> no idea, we couldn't really test that witout a working kcm backend...
[10:50] <apachelogger> lol?
[10:50] <apachelogger> python3 randomfile.py
[10:50] <apachelogger> ?
[10:50] <yofel> if nobody ported one, then no
[10:51] <yofel> I tried myself on synaptiks, but that didn't go too well
[11:04] <apachelogger> oh
[11:05] <apachelogger> yofel: got time to recompile pykde?
[11:16] <apachelogger> on which system did I work on the broken kcm Oo
[11:17] <apachelogger> my workstation does not even have pykde > 4.9
[11:20] <ovidiu-florin> hello world, I just received an update for jockey, and I was just curious, what's new in it? I think I remember seeing in the kubuntu devel mail list that jockey is to be replaced by something else. Is that true? If yes, how's that going?
[11:21] <Riddell> JontheEchidna ^^
[11:22] <apachelogger> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/659936/
[11:22] <apachelogger> I'd first run that by someone who cares, the global interpreter lock thing makes no sense to me
[11:22] <apachelogger> though that patch definitelyw orks
[11:22] <apachelogger> found the right VM again
[11:35] <yofel> apachelogger: I'll try that once I'm at home, here I'm on quantal
[11:37] <ovidiu-florin> one sugestion: can it be implemented in the Kmenu, on the bottom right, next to the kubuntu logo to also say the kubuntu version? it would be a lot easier for new users to figure this out
[11:38] <vassie> Riddell: good morning
[11:40] <vassie> Riddell: been thinking about the cantata "not is users group" message, personally i think it should stay, being in that group does have it benefits, however if you don't want/need to be in it, tick the box and hide the message
[11:41] <Riddell> hi vassie, ok you're the packager :)
[11:41] <vassie> Riddell: :)
[11:42] <Riddell> ovidiu-florin: yes I'd be interested in something like that but probably not somewhere as intrusive as the kmenu
[11:42] <Riddell> vassie: did you look at a watch file?
[11:42] <vassie> Riddell: still not sure what to do with the watch file
[11:42] <Riddell> make one that points at the download page
[11:42] <vassie> and put it where?
[11:43] <vassie> is there an example of one i can use?
[11:43] <Riddell> vassie: I suggested owncloud
[11:44] <vassie> from the deb?
[11:44] <Riddell> apt-get source owncloud
[11:46] <vassie> ok, got it, do i need to modify it and rebuild my package?
[11:46] <Riddell> just a random suggestion though, you might want to look at a package which is hosted on google code
[11:46] <Riddell> modity it and test it :)
[11:47] <vassie> http://code.google.com/p/cantata/downloads/list
[11:47] <vassie> is there an example i can use?
[11:47] <Riddell> that looks like a good page
[11:48] <Riddell> try modifying the owncloud one
[11:49] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[11:50] <ovidiu-florin> Riddell: on the bottom of the Kmenu, right where the User's full name and host name is, 
[11:51] <vassie> http://pastebin.com/J57bM94a
[11:53] <Riddell> golly that looks complex
[11:53] <Riddell> vassie: tested it?
[11:53] <vassie> copy one from a program that was hosted on good code
[11:54] <vassie> how do i test?
[11:55] <Riddell> put it in a copy of the package sources and run uscan
[11:56] <vassie> k, need to power on my vm, might be on my desktop at home actually, this might take a while
[11:56] <Riddell> vassie: you can ask me for an ec2 if that helps
[11:57] <vassie> thanks, but will i have to build my package from scratch?
[11:57] <Riddell> vassie: you don't have to build anything, you just need the package source (which you can download from your PPA on launchpad)
[11:58] <BluesKaj> vassie, I have Cantata running ok , just have to configure mpd to startup at boot 
[11:59] <vassie> got my source, added my current key to my ppa
[12:08] <vassie> ran uscan, nothing came back
[12:10] <Riddell> vassie: I get "uscan ERROR: debian/watch version number is unrecognised; skipping watchfile"
[12:10] <Riddell> so it doesn't like that one
[12:10] <vassie> change version=1 to version=3
=== mgraesslin_ is now known as mgraesslin
[12:17] <vassie> BluesKaj: i add "mpd" to ~/.xprofile so it starts on login
[12:19] <shadeslayer> oh grrr
[12:20] <shadeslayer> xnox: how do I make some code execute once a page has been loaded in ubiquity?
[12:20] <shadeslayer> i.e. once the event loop is running
[12:21] <xnox> shadeslayer: i'm not sure what you mean.
[12:21] <shadeslayer> well
[12:21] <shadeslayer> in order to get the devices Phonon needs an event loop running
[12:22] <Riddell> vassie: try kmediafactory maybe
[12:23] <vassie> i did, that is where i got it from
[12:24] <vassie> i changed 1 to 3 and i don't get an error now
[12:24] <Riddell> vassie: if you run uscan --verbose does it say useful things?
[12:25] <vassie> Newest version on remote site is 0.9.2, local version is 0.9.2
[12:25] <Riddell> groovy
[12:25] <Riddell> vassie: so are we ready to upload?
[12:26] <vassie> i'm happy with it
[12:26] <vassie> :)
[12:26] <vassie> quantal and raring?
[12:26] <Riddell> just raring
[12:26] <Riddell> point me at the files to upload
[12:26] <vassie> can it be backported?
[12:27] <xnox> shadeslayer: right, but when event loop is running, that means python code is not executed sequentially any more, only callbacks are called.....
[12:27] <Riddell> yes, we can either put it into kubuntu-ppa/backports or once its in raring go through the proccess for the ubunut backports
[12:27] <vassie> Do you need my new cantata_0.9.2-0ubuntu3~ubuntu12.10~ppa1.debian.tar.gz?
[12:27] <vassie> and raring package?
[12:27] <xnox> shadeslayer: so in your __init__ or in your prepare funtions you need to setup callbacks that phonon will call if it finds or doesn't find a camera.
[12:28] <shadeslayer> okay
[12:29] <Riddell> vassie: yep
[12:29] <vassie> Riddell: ok, i need to sign them as i rebuilt my tar.gz, plus i need my raring VM, which is at home
[12:30] <Riddell> vassie: no you don't
[12:30] <Riddell> I need to sign them when I upload them, you don't have permission to upload to the ubuntu archive so your signature won't do anything
[12:30] <Riddell> vassie: just point me at what needs uploading
[12:31] <vassie> both packages are on my ppa https://launchpad.net/~vassie/+archive/ppa
[12:32] <vassie> watch file http://pastebin.com/J57bM94a (change version=1 to version=3)
[12:32] <Riddell> vassie: 0.9.2-0ubuntu3~ppa2 ?
[12:32] <vassie> i can't download my raring package right now as i am on quantal
[12:33] <Riddell> you can download whatever you like, this is free software :)
[12:33] <vassie> that is my raring package, minus the watch file
[12:33] <Riddell> http://ppa.launchpad.net/vassie/ppa/ubuntu/pool/main/c/cantata/  wget is your friend :)
[12:33] <Riddell> I got it now
[12:36] <Riddell> vassie: uploaded!
[12:36] <Riddell> it should appear at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+queue soon
[12:36] <vassie> :)
[12:37] <vassie> sweet
[12:37] <Riddell> vassie: and now you need to wait for an archive admin to accept it, happens the first time you load anything
[12:37] <vassie> Riddell: awesome, i'll sit tight
[12:38] <Riddell> vassie: in the mean time there's plenty more to do, rekonq, libmtp etc :)
[12:38] <vassie> Riddell: will the quantal package go to ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports?
[12:38] <Riddell> also 4.10 is being tagged tonight so that's the big one
[12:38] <Riddell> vassie: yeah can do, point me at what to upload there
[12:40] <vassie> Riddell: https://www.box.com/s/6bnjtzqkvvm6lhmdavvk
[12:44] <Riddell> vassie: uploaded!
[12:44] <vassie> :)
[12:44] <vassie> thank you
[12:46] <vassie> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+queue?queue_state=4&queue_text=cantata
[12:46] <Riddell> vassie: I just rejected it cos I noticed the control file needed some tidying
[12:46] <Riddell> vassie: I've reuploaded with the tidying
[12:46] <vassie> oh, ok
[12:47] <Riddell> you hadn't give na description and it needed word warp on the long description
[12:47] <vassie> oh right, sorry
[12:58] <shadeslayer> xnox: is the event loop running when plugin_get_current_page is called?
[12:58] <shadeslayer> or is it run right after plugin_get_current_page ?
[13:02]  * apachelogger pokes shadeslayer with a long stick
[13:02] <shadeslayer> ?
[13:02] <apachelogger> it does not matter
[13:02] <apachelogger> change line order and suddenly you have no eventloop where you had one before
[13:03] <apachelogger> use the qevent functions
[13:04] <xnox> shadeslayer: look into run_main_loop / quit_main_loop. We stop mainloop between the pages, when we start mainloop again, you don't have any flow control at all. You are just hoping that an event/signal/handler is triggered by Qt and possible calls your callbacks.
[13:05] <shadeslayer> aha
[13:05] <xnox> shadeslayer: and you still didn't tell us what you are trying to achieve that brought you down the rabbit hole of main loops.
[13:05] <xnox> what are you trying to achieve? "I need to know X, I decided i can check it using Y and hence...." tells us the full story. maybe your first assumption is wrong.....
[13:06] <shadeslayer> xnox: Phonon needs event loops so that I can query for the video camera device list
[13:06] <xnox> and why do you need to query for the video camera device list?
[13:06] <shadeslayer> to create a MediaSource?
[13:07] <xnox> (in gtk, widgets have on_realise callback, such that you can piggy back on to that to run some code when widgets are painted/actually created)
[13:07] <shadeslayer> hm
[13:07] <xnox> shadeslayer: this has nothing to do with ubiquity, but rather python & qt.
[13:07] <shadeslayer> right
[13:07]  * xnox doesn't do any python-qt work
[13:08] <shadeslayer> hm
[13:09] <Riddell> smartboyhw: hi!
[13:09] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you want to be an elite packager?
[13:11] <Riddell> oh well
[13:13] <vassie> Riddell: what happens when 0.9.3 is out?
[13:13] <Riddell> vassie: then you package it :)
[13:14] <vassie> Riddell: :)
[13:15] <BluesKaj> vassie, ok managed to fix the mpd startup problem. I ran sudo update-rc.d mpd enable , then updated rc.d . It connects to localhost 
[13:15] <vassie> BluesKaj: great, everything working now?
[13:16] <BluesKaj> yup . seems so , vassie , altho I haven;t tried the networking options and won't until my laptop is returned
[13:17] <vassie> BluesKaj: i store my music in ~/Music and use pulse
[13:20] <BluesKaj> yes I use pulse as well , I made a link to my music files on the external hdd to /var/lib/mpd/music/
[13:20] <BluesKaj> vassie,^
[13:24] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you want to be an elite packager?
[13:24] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yeah:)
[13:27] <Riddell> smartboyhw: got bored of Ubuntu Studio and want to do kubuntu?
[13:28] <smartboyhw> Riddell, not exactly. Normally I do testing in Ubuntu Studio. I want to be involved in packaging, and that Kubuntu seems to have more opportunities for that. 
[13:28] <Riddell> always welcomed :)
[13:28] <Riddell> smartboyhw: want a simple task to start off with?
[13:28] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yep
[13:28] <Riddell> smartboyhw: rekonq could do with an update
[13:29] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ok
[13:29] <Riddell> yay :)
[13:30] <smartboyhw> Riddell, so I just branch the main ~ubuntu-branches branch right?>
[13:32] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you can do use the UDD branches but I tihnk it's easier to just go apt-get source rekonq
[13:32] <Riddell> rekonq's packaging isn't in bzr
[13:32] <smartboyhw> Riddell, oh no:P
[13:33] <Riddell> hi rgreening, how's the province?
[13:33] <Riddell> smartboyhw: I'm assuming you've done this sort of thing before, have you?
[13:34] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yes (but I use UDD branches :P)
[13:34] <Riddell> smartboyhw: well feel free to use them
[13:34] <Riddell> they're just too complex for me (and I used to develop on bzr and UDD :)
[13:34] <smartboyhw> Riddell, lol
[13:38] <Riddell> smartboyhw: let me know if you need any help
[13:38] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ok:)
[13:40] <ScottK> shadeslayer: pyside is somewhat broken and the sync was a (it turned out) unfounded hope to make thing better, but it certainly didn't make things worse.
[13:40] <shadeslayer> ScottK: well ... idk what happened but in raring I can't install python3-pyside
[13:41] <ScottK> IIRC there's no binaries.
[13:41] <shadeslayer> but -release has binaries?
[13:41] <shadeslayer> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pyside/1.1.1-3
[13:43] <BluesKaj> rekonq still suffers from javascript problems , some game sites are freeezing
[13:44] <Riddell> best hope smartboyhw does this update
[13:44] <smartboyhw> Riddell, halfway:)
[13:45] <apachelogger> xnox: how can one get the stdout output from a plugin?
[13:45] <xnox> it's in /var/log/installer/debug isn't it?
[13:45] <xnox> or syslog
[13:48] <Riddell> apachelogger: you're looking at uibiquity too?
[13:50] <smartboyhw> Riddell, help. I can't build the package since kdelibs5-dev has a dependency of libphonon-dev, but then libphonon-dev has a dependency of libphonon4
[13:50] <smartboyhw>  libphonon-dev : Depends: libphonon4 (= 4:4.7.0really4.6.0-0ubuntu2) but 4:4.7.0really4.6.0-0ubuntu2+nopulse1 is to be installed
[13:50] <apachelogger> xnox: found it, thx
[13:50] <smartboyhw> I don't think I have ppa's with this.
[13:50] <apachelogger> Riddell: yeah -.-
[13:51] <Riddell> smartboyhw: pastebin  apt-cache policy libphonon-dev
[13:51] <Riddell> smartboyhw: pastebin  apt-cache policy libphonon4
[13:51] <Riddell> apachelogger: what are you looking at?
[13:52] <smartboyhw> Riddell, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1589659/
[13:53] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you've installed that +nopulse1 version from somewhere
[13:53] <Riddell> a PPA you no longer use
[13:54] <Riddell> from KXStudio-Team Artwork and Metas owned by KXStudio Team  says launchpad
[13:54] <apachelogger> Riddell: same thing as shadeslayer
[13:54] <Riddell> smartboyhw: wget the .deb from launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/
[13:55] <Riddell> and dpkg --install  it
[13:56] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ok (/me suddenly hates KXStudio)
[13:58] <Riddell> hmm, developer membership board elections
[13:58] <Riddell> ScottK: who do I want to vote for?
[13:59] <jussi> haha
[13:59] <ScottK> Who's running?
[13:59] <jussi> ScottK: is like the "brains trust" :D
[13:59] <ScottK> Apparently there's a mail I didn't get.
[13:59] <ScottK> I mean I know I'm running.
[13:59] <ScottK> Just not who else.
[13:59] <Riddell> ScottK: bdrung, coolbhavi, cody-somervile, xnox, laney, scottk, stgraber
[14:00] <ScottK> Some difficult choices there.
[14:02] <Riddell> scottk gets points for being a kuubntu homey, xnox for being friendly enough to hang around with us kubuntu homeys, stgraber for being french, laney for being a canoeist
[14:02] <Riddell> I don't think I know enough about the others to say what they get points for
[14:04] <xnox> I'm guessing coolbhavi, ScottK and I are the ones contesting against previously serving members of the developer membership board.
[14:04] <jussi> how many are needed?
[14:04] <ScottK> 4
[14:04] <xnox> 4 are expiring.
[14:04] <ScottK> I finally got the mail.
[14:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, good now I'm test-building the package:)

[14:40] <Riddell> hi jackyalcine 
[14:40] <Riddell> will do that in a bit
[14:40] <snele> shadeslayer: you did great job with backporting 4.10 to precise. everything work well. thank you
[14:41] <jackyalcine> Riddell: thanks
[14:42] <Riddell> smartboyhw: so have you built and run it locally?
[14:43] <shadeslayer> snele: me and yofel :)
[14:43] <Riddell> jackyalcine: what needs those cmake files?
[14:44] <snele> shadeslayer: yofel: you did great job with backporting 4.10 to precise. everything works well. thank you guys. you rock!
[14:44] <snele> :)))
[14:44] <jackyalcine> Riddell: anyone trying to build KDE IM from source.
[14:44] <jackyalcine> if telepathy-logger-qt was a part of kde-telepathy, I wouldn't have bothered
[14:45] <shadeslayer> it is?
[14:45] <shadeslayer> it's released as a part of kde-telepathy
[14:45] <Riddell> it's a separate source 
[14:45] <jackyalcine> yup
[14:46] <shadeslayer> well sure
[14:46] <smartboyhw> Riddell, the app works
[14:46] <smartboyhw> More amazingly, it works in xfce (LOL)
[14:46] <shadeslayer> ahhh okay
[14:47] <jackyalcine> it makes me wonder, how does it build in bbuild without those CMake files?
[14:47] <smartboyhw> Riddell, jackyalcine told me to bzrignore the .pc files.
[14:47] <smartboyhw> Should I upload a new -0ubuntu2 version then?
[14:47] <Riddell> jackyalcine: I've updated the changelog to make it clearer "Fix .install file to provide valid CMake development files"
[14:47] <jackyalcine> you shouldn't have to, smartboyhw
[14:47] <smartboyhw> jackyalcine, oh ok
[14:47] <Riddell> smartboyhw: I'm ignoring them too
[14:48] <smartboyhw> Riddell, :)
[14:48] <jackyalcine> unless you ignored them specifically in that repository.
[14:48] <Riddell> jackyalcine: you also want to become an elite kubuntu packager?
[14:48] <jackyalcine> Riddell: thanks, I did this at like 3:00 AM here in New York
[14:48] <jackyalcine> haven't slept until I got a response :)

[14:50]  * jackyalcine is going to have fun.
[14:50]  * smartboyhw is going to have fun too
[14:50] <Riddell> we have more things needing an update for anyone interested, ktorrent and libmtp come to mind
[14:51] <jackyalcine> for raring?
[14:51] <Riddell> jackyalcine: yep
[14:54] <jackyalcine> smartboyhw: you're looking at libmtp or ktorrent?
[14:55] <ScottK> ktorrent also has a libktorrent update that goes with it.
[14:55] <ScottK> See Debian experimental.
[14:57] <Riddell> jackyalcine: take your pick I think
[14:59] <smartboyhw> jackyalcine, your pick:P
[15:02] <jackyalcine> ScottK: I'd have to peek at the upstream packaging for ktorrent before making any changes?
[15:03] <Riddell> jackyalcine: you should always check debian first for updates
[15:03] <Riddell> ktorrent is just a sync I think so check they have the newer version and file a sync bug
[15:03]  * smartboyhw feels happy that at least the amd64 and i386 builds for rekonq is built successfully
[15:04] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I think libmtp is also a sync bug.....
[15:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, the newest version is already there in Raring, no need for libmtp updates I think
[15:05] <BluesKaj> so updating/upgrading will bring the fixes into rekonq ?
[15:06] <BluesKaj> on raring
[15:07] <Riddell> smartboyhw: mm, then you might want to ask shadeslayer what he was on about when he asked :)
[15:07] <yofel> BluesKaj: well, 2.1 at least has a fixed history. I think they  fixed plenty of other things too
[15:10] <BluesKaj> yofel, let's hope the javascipt troubles were addressed
[15:13] <BluesKaj> nope , rekonq still freezes on some online game sites , stops loading after 15 secs or so 
[15:14] <BluesKaj> then the javascript error pops up after a min or so
[15:15] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, you mean the 2.1 version?
[15:17] <BluesKaj> oops nope the 2.0 , smartboyhw
[15:17] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, LOL
[15:17] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, activate -proposed and you should be able to upgrade (unless you are using -armhf)
[15:19] <shadeslayer> no no no
[15:20] <shadeslayer> enabling proposed is a bad idea :P
[15:20] <BluesKaj> I was about to ask that question shadeslayer .;..had probs with it before
[15:21] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, what about libmtp? The newest version is there already;P
[15:22] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: right, but in general it'd be a good idea to have a look at the commits because for eg. my HTC One X is not supported from the last released version
[15:22] <shadeslayer> but it works from git

[17:10] <shadeslayer> tsimpson: no people are weird
[17:11] <tsimpson> shadeslayer: people came up with timezones, so it only makes sense then
[17:11] <shadeslayer> just saying that timezones are not inherently weird
[17:12] <tsimpson> they are because they seem to be randomly placed

[17:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: since the error log states that i shoud try to add "-pkg:gtk-sharp2" i added it to the configure.am where the "-pkg:tomboy-addins" is added but its not getting reflected in the build process as you can see the parameter is missing
[17:23] <phoenix_firebrd> thats configure.ac
[17:24] <phoenix_firebrd> sorry its not configure.ac
[17:24] <yofel> try -pkg:gtk-sharp-2.0
[17:26] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: makefile.in is created by makefile.am right?
[17:26] <yofel> uh, I think yes, it's been over a year since I last touched autotools
[17:27] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I have to search were i can insert this param
[17:27] <phoenix_firebrd> gotit
[17:28] <phoenix_firebrd> this is the makefile.am in the source dir ->http://paste.kde.org/660728/
[17:29] <phoenix_firebrd> i had already added "-pkg:gtk-sharp" before, you want to replace that with the one you said?
[17:29] <phoenix_firebrd> if so why didn't it get reflected in the log?
[17:30] <phoenix_firebrd> the current package name is gtk-shark2
[17:30] <phoenix_firebrd> the current package name is gtk-sharp2
[17:31] <yofel> the pkg-config file is name gtk-sharp-2.0 though
[17:31] <yofel> that's what gmcs is looking for
[17:31] <phoenix_firebrd> pkg-config ?
[17:32] <yofel> !info pkg-config

[17:33] <phoenix_firebrd> checking
[17:33] <phoenix_firebrd> ok i will try with "gtk-sharp-2.0"
[17:33] <yofel> meh
[17:34] <yofel> I added it in Makefile.in, but now it fails with
[17:34] <yofel> ../../src/AuthenticationTypes.cs(44,41): error CS0433: The imported type `System.Web.HttpUtility' is defined multiple times
[17:34] <yofel> you should find someone familiar with mono and autotools in #ubuntu-motu
[17:34] <yofel> that's really not our field of expertise
[17:35] <yofel> (oh, if you ever want to package our mono bindings, that's like totally adavnced expert insanity stuff, but we would be very happy)
[17:35] <yofel> so far everyone gave up
[17:36] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I am thinking that if i pass through this, i may suceed in any upcoming mono dep packages
[17:38] <phoenix_firebrd> packaging is very interesting
[17:38] <yofel> try to get something of your work into the archive though ;)
[17:39] <phoenix_firebrd> I feel if i keep packaging for a year i may end up knowing atleast 30% of the source on ubuntu
[17:39] <phoenix_firebrd> :)
[17:42] <ScottK> Then by the end of the second year, you'll have touched 50% and forgotten half of it.
[17:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: So since it seems there is an error in the source , shall i drop trying to  build it?
[17:43] <yofel> well, you'll at least have to ask someone else how that works
[17:44] <yofel> I can't build that either though, so maybe it is just a bug in the buildsystem
[17:44] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: shall i take a look at it tomorrow?
[17:45] <yofel> feel free to, but you'll have to find someone else for help
[17:45] <yofel> as I said, someone in #ubuntu-motu might know what to do here
[17:45] <phoenix_firebrd> ScottK: i can try for 100% :)
[17:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[17:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: Is there a list that shows the packages by deps for example mono, java, python etc
[17:47] <yofel> I don't know, you could look at the package section, but that's not always correct
[17:48] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok

[17:49] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: just to confirm , day after tomorrow kde 4.10 sc is tagged right?
[17:49] <yofel> officially, it's today at 23:59 UTC
[17:49] <yofel> so we should have the tars by tomorrow
[17:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so you will be working throught the night?
[17:51] <yofel> no
[17:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in that case will it be ok if i be here tomorrow 12 pm my time?
[17:53] <yofel> sure, you won't be able to help much anyway except watching as you don't have sufficient permissions yet to work on KDE
[17:53] <yofel> for that you'll have to convince Riddell that you're on ninja level first
[17:53] <phoenix_firebrd> ya, when will the process start, in your time
[17:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: yours is +4:30 am i right?
[17:54] <yofel> I'm GMT+1
[17:54] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[17:54] <yofel> but it depends when tsdgeos finished building the tars and then the first ninja to see the tars will get to work
[17:54] <phoenix_firebrd> ya, when will the process start?
[17:55] <phoenix_firebrd> ok
[17:55]  * rgreening yawns
[17:55] <yofel> as most of the initial process is scripted there's nothing fancy in the beginning anyway ^^
[17:55] <yofel> you can watch the build progress at the page linked in the topic
[17:56] <phoenix_firebrd> we can beat suse this time?
[17:56] <phoenix_firebrd> are they using cluster for building?
[17:57] <yofel> That's impossible to predict, but as we have a week we should at least be done in time
[17:57] <yofel> dunno, but we're building in parallel on launchpad too, it just takes a while
[17:57] <phoenix_firebrd> soon this will happen
[17:57] <yofel> and might need some manual work
[17:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[17:58] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I will be here at 7: 30 am your time
[17:58] <yofel> I'll tell you more tomorrow, for today I'll finally go home...
[17:59] <yofel> I at least an hour later, but the others will be around
[17:59] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ya. good night, see you tomorrow
[18:01] <yofel> 'night
[18:29] <shadeslayer> yofel: is the raring status page up in anticipation of a release?
[18:45] <yofel> shadeslayer: topic...

[18:45] <shadeslayer> okay

[20:42] <Noskcaj> ScottK, have you had a look at bug 1066225 with the screenshot?

[20:43] <yofel> hm, now it did crash
[20:43] <yofel> but with this: http://paste.kde.org/660866
[20:46] <yofel> with some more symbols: http://paste.kde.org/660878

[20:51] <yofel> hm, now I can't reproduce that crash. Old lib in memory I guess
[20:52] <yofel> ok, it did now - when closing system settings (sometimes)
[20:55] <yofel> that's synaptiks I guess looking at bug 1098288

[21:42] <ScottK> Riddell: Can you look at what went wrong with the fix for 1066225?
[21:42] <ScottK> Noskcaj: I hadn't.  Thanks.
[21:59] <apachelogger> review please https://launchpad.net/~apachelogger/+archive/ppa/+files/mangonel_0.1~git20130130-0ubuntu1.dsc
[22:00] <yofel> ScottK: that .ui file doesn't render really well in qtdesigner here: http://people.ubuntu.com/~yofel/pics/user_design.png
[22:01] <ScottK> Hmm.
[22:01]  * ScottK looks harder at Riddell.
[22:01] <apachelogger> looks like the size hinting of the grid there is broken
[22:01] <yofel> maybe because you removed the layout?
[22:01] <apachelogger> (assuming it is a grid ^^)
[22:01] <yofel> the ui file *had* <layout class="QGridLayout" name="gridLayout_8">
[22:02] <apachelogger> well, one can work without grids
[22:05] <yofel> well, now the radio buttons are simply inside a qwidget, whose preferred size here is 10
[22:06] <yofel> *preferred height
[22:10] <yofel> wtf?
[22:10] <yofel> Lay out > Lay out in a Grid; press ctrl+Z; -> it looks righ
[22:10] <yofel> t
[22:11] <apachelogger> designer files are a flipping mess
[22:14] <yofel> well, considering that widget already has fixed content widget sizes, setting a minimum Size wouldn't hurt I guess
[22:14] <yofel> feels like the wrong way to fix it though
[22:15] <apachelogger> depending on what the widget contains it may also be wrong
[22:15] <yofel> 2 radio buttons and one indented checkbox
[22:15] <apachelogger> does it contain text?
[22:16] <yofel> apachelogger: that's how it was intended: http://people.ubuntu.com/~yofel/pics/user_design1.png
[22:16] <apachelogger> yah, minimumsize is wrong though
[22:16] <apachelogger> as text labels have no fixed minimumsize
[22:17] <yofel> well, they do have set sizes in the ui file though
[22:17] <yofel> http://paste.kde.org/660974
[22:17] <apachelogger> yeah its to make sure the uis coming out of designer are as broken as possible
[22:18] <apachelogger> I reckon it should be a grid though
[22:18] <yofel> well, it was a grid, but how do you do the indenting? (except by adding a fixed spacer)
[22:19] <apachelogger> also to get perfect visual results regardless of the qt style/fontsize you'd want to have a radio underneith the other radio that is hidden
[22:19] <apachelogger> that's how you'd grid
[22:19] <yofel> o.O
[22:19] <apachelogger> (*) require the might login
[22:20] <apachelogger> ( ) [x] decrypt the awesome home
[22:20] <apachelogger> of course the second radio would be invis
[22:21] <yofel> hm, that kind of makes sense
[22:21] <apachelogger> the other option is to detach the text from the radio
[22:21] <apachelogger> i.e. (*) is the radio and 'require the might login' is a secondary label
[22:22] <apachelogger> (of course then you need to manually wire the stateness between those
[22:22] <apachelogger> also an option though
[22:22] <apachelogger> so you get 
[22:22] <apachelogger> (*) | require the mighty login
[22:23] <apachelogger>     | [x] decrypt the awesome home
[22:23] <apachelogger> | representing a vertical layout border
[22:24] <apachelogger> oh and a third option that woudl be entirely code based ... you create a radiobutton without text, get it's size hint and set that as width&height of a spaceritem that is left of the checkbox
[22:25] <apachelogger> i.e. you have a temporary radio button that is not really used but that dictates what size the spacer needs to be
[22:27] <yofel> well, the hidden, button seems to work, except that you need to hide it in the code
