[02:53] <ObsequiousNewt> Hey, I'm back; remember me?
[02:53] <ObsequiousNewt> The guy who bricked his partition?
[02:53] <ObsequiousNewt> Well, gpart finished running, and it came up with nothing.
[02:54] <ObsequiousNewt> It didn't find *any* possible partitions.
[03:32] <hdevalence> I keep crashing X when snapping windows (backtrace at the end of http://paste.kde.org/646160/); should I assume it's just an issue with AMD's drivers?

[07:49] <nascentmind> Hi. My fonts don't look that great. I have some different lighter colors at the edge of my fonts. I have turned off sub pixel rendering. Is that the cause.
=== pjoe_afk is now known as pjoe
[08:49] <Wizard> nascentmind: Yes.
[08:53] <nascentmind> Wizard, After an update even with sub pixel rendering enabled it looked bad.
[08:53] <nascentmind> Wizard, somehow the fonts look smaller in the browser and sometimes it looks fine.

[11:38] <ikar> hi! can someone help me? i don't see any wireless in the list.
[11:48] <BillyZane|2> hello!
[11:48] <BillyZane|2> got a question.... I tried to update my video card drivers on gnome (GTX 660) and it was a huge failure, i had to remove them
[11:48] <BillyZane|2> right now i'm on kubuntu and i opened up "additional drivers" utility. it found 3 different types of nvidia drivers for me to install. Now my fear is that if i try installing them, it will cause a system instability like last time. should this happen, how would i remove these drivers using  terminal?
[11:50] <lordievader> BillyZane|2: By using the same jockey, but then the text version: jockey-text -d <DRIVER>, you can find the driver name by running: jockey-text =l
[11:51] <BillyZane|2> hmm
[11:51] <BillyZane|2> please forgive me but i am very new
[11:52] <BillyZane|2> so...
[11:52] <BillyZane|2> i don't see anything that says jockey on the additional drivers utility
[11:53] <BillyZane|2> however, i could install these drivers using the jockey-text command? what is jockey-text?
[11:53] <BillyZane|2> (i try to learn as i go along)
[11:58] <lordievader> BillyZane|2: Ah, jockey-text is the same as the Additional Drivers tool, just that the text-version is made for the terminal.
[11:59] <lordievader> BillyZane|2: So if the driver throws up a black-screen and you need to recover through the terminal you can do so using the same jockey.
[12:00] <BillyZane|2> oh, cool
[12:00] <BillyZane|2> can you tell me the command for removing the driver, in case i experience a problem?
[12:01] <lordievader> BillyZane|2: It's the "jockey-text -d <DRIVER>" to find the name of the driver use: "jockey-text -l"
[12:02] <BillyZane|2> is there a text based driver search feature?
[12:02] <BillyZane|2> so i can find the exact name of the driver
[12:03] <lordievader> BillyZane|2: Second command, the "jockey-text -l"
[12:03] <BillyZane|2> ohhh right
[12:04] <BillyZane|2> so -l searchers, -d downloads
[12:04] <BillyZane|2> does -r remove?
[12:04] <lordievader> BillyZane|2: -d
[12:04] <BillyZane|2> then how do you install?
[12:05] <lordievader> BillyZane|2: -e, for the full explanation see: "jockey-text --help" or "man jockey-text"
[12:05] <BillyZane|2> ok
[12:05] <BillyZane|2> thank you
[12:06] <lordievader> BillyZane|2: No problem.

[13:49] <BillyZane|2> i am very new to kubuntu
[13:49] <BillyZane|2> how do i activate resource monitor?
[13:50] <BillyZane|2> i know there's a program that does it...
[13:51] <bazhang> BillyZane|2, you switched to kde?
=== spawn[dead] is now known as spawn57
[13:52] <BillyZane|2> yup
[13:52] <hateball> BillyZane|2: do you mean process monitor?
[13:52] <BillyZane|2> it was there on gnome
[13:52] <BillyZane|2> yeah!
[13:52] <BillyZane|2> that's the stuff
[13:52] <hateball> BillyZane|2: ctrl+esc
[13:52] <bazhang> BillyZane|2, why are you crossposting in #ubuntu
[13:52] <BillyZane|2> whoaaa
[13:53] <BillyZane|2> umm
[13:53] <BillyZane|2> because i am multiasking
[13:53] <bazhang> !crosspost | BillyZane|2
[13:53] <ubottu> BillyZane|2: Please don't ask the same question in multiple Ubuntu channels at the same time. Many helpers are in more than one channel and it's not fair to them or the other people seeking support.
[13:54] <BillyZane|2> is it cross posting if i ask a different question?
[13:55] <BillyZane|2> hateball: can i not run process monitor on KDE?
[13:55] <BillyZane|2> am i forced to use system activity? because there's no cool graph
[13:59] <hateball> I'm not sure what process monitor is
[14:00] <bazhang> htop
[14:00] <hateball> There's various plasmoids if you want a CPU graph or something on your plasma desktop
[14:01] <BillyZane|2> sweet
[14:01] <BillyZane|2> what's a good one?
[14:02] <hateball> Whatever you like, I suppose
[14:02]  * hateball does not use such things
[14:03] <BillyZane|2> ooo
[14:03] <BillyZane|2> are they called plasmoids?
[14:11] <BillyZane|2> i'm going to sleep
[14:11] <BillyZane|2> thanks for the info
[14:11] <BillyZane|2> sorry for being a crossposting

[15:14] <rawon> hello
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[15:19] <rawon> mm hope some of you can help me
[15:20] <rawon> i've tried to install kubuntu on my netbook
[15:20] <rawon> the install went well but after restart kubuntu won't starts
[15:21] <rawon> is it possible that kubuntu can't handle my netbook?
[15:24] <DarthFrog> rawon:  You'll have to give more specific detail than "won't start".
[15:25] <rawon> well it is on terminal mode
[15:25] <rawon> no graphics desktop
[15:25] <rawon> can log in
[15:26] <DarthFrog> Then read /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see why X isn't starting.  Kubuntu is running, X isn't, by the sounds of things.
[15:26] <rawon> tried to switch with ctrl+alt+f7 to desktop mode
[15:26] <rawon> but nothing happens
[15:26] <DarthFrog> Won't do anything if X isn't running.
[15:26] <DarthFrog> Then read /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see why X isn't starting.  Kubuntu is running, X isn't, by the sounds of things.
[15:27] <DarthFrog> There's where your answer is.
[15:27] <rawon> oh thank you
[15:27] <rawon> but
[15:27] <rawon> can't understand that the installer works fine
[15:28] <rawon> than it's not boot corrlectly
[15:28] <DarthFrog> the installer was probably using the VESA drivers.
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[15:29] <rawon> I see
[15:29] <DarthFrog> rawon:  Please separate in your mind the graphical desktop (i.e. X) and the operating system itself.
[15:29] <DarthFrog> If you can log in to a virtual terminal, the OS is running fine.
[15:29] <rawon> btw i'm really a beginner...
[15:29] <DarthFrog> X is only one process that the OS runs.  A complicated process but only one process.
[15:30] <DarthFrog> Yes, I can tell that.   Nothing wrong in that.
[15:30] <DarthFrog> What video card do you have?
[15:30] <rawon> well it's a Intel Grapics Media Accelerator 3600
[15:30] <rawon> Intel atom cpu
[15:31] <rawon> 1gb ddr3 ram
[15:31] <DarthFrog> OK, I'm of no use to you with that video card, sorry.
[15:31] <rawon> i guess my graphics card can
[15:31] <rawon> is the problem
[15:31] <rawon> yes it's crap
[15:31] <DarthFrog> From the command line, now that you are logged in, run this command: startx
[15:33] <rawon> um i deleted it to try ubuntu 9.04 netbook edition
[15:34] <rawon> downloading it at the moment
[15:34] <DarthFrog> 9.04?  Too old.
[15:34] <rawon> should i reinstall kubuntu 12?
[15:35] <DarthFrog> Which one?  12.04 or 12.10?
[15:35] <rawon> 12.10
[15:35] <DarthFrog> the oldest version you should consider installing is 10.04.
[15:36] <DarthFrog> Well, since you had troubles with 12.10, I'd suggest trying 12.04.  It's a LTS release (Long Term Support), which means, amongst other things, that it's a good version for a newbie.
[15:37] <DarthFrog> LTS has 3 years support guaranteed on the desktop.
[15:37] <rawon> sounds good
[15:37] <DarthFrog> Non-LTS versions (such as 12.10) can break things. :-)
[15:37] <DarthFrog> LTS versions strive for stability.
[15:38] <rawon> now I know the difference :)
[15:38] <rawon> thank you:)
[15:38] <DarthFrog> You're welcome.
[15:38] <bazhang> 12.04 LTS is five years for both
[15:39] <DarthFrog> Have fun!  Linux is great fun.   :-)
[15:39] <rawon> downloading the kubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-i386.iso
[15:40] <rawon> hope it will boot up
[15:41] <rawon> linux is fun:) I really want to try it
[15:42] <DarthFrog> it will boot.  No guarantee that you won't run into the same video problem.  If you do, come back here and ask for help.  Be sure to mention that you can log in at a virtual terminal and that you're not getting a graphical login prompt. that's essential information.
[15:43] <rawon> thank you so much for your help!
[15:43] <DarthFrog> you're welcome.
[15:44]  * rawon bow before DarthFrog 
[15:45] <DarthFrog> LOL!

[20:09] <vbgunz>  Anyone know how to permanently accept/deny friend request in Telepathy on KDE 4.9.97?
[20:21] <shadeslayer> vbgunz: all of them who get accepted don't pop up again
[20:21] <shadeslayer> but 'Deny' doesn't really deny
[20:22] <shadeslayer> I have a patch rotting on Review Board for that :P
[20:22] <shadeslayer> 'Deny' actually triggers what you would call 'Later'
[20:23] <shadeslayer> https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/107012/diff/#index_header
[20:24] <vbgunz> shadeslayer so accepting then deleting or something might work?
[20:25] <shadeslayer> yes
[20:25] <shadeslayer> that should work
[20:25] <shadeslayer> but, it depends on a couple of other things :P
[20:25] <shadeslayer> for eg how does the IM server handle this?
[20:25] <shadeslayer> does the roster for the person who sent the request also get updated?
[20:26] <shadeslayer> at times servers only implement Blocking and not removing
[20:26] <shadeslayer> so it's a hit and miss at times
[20:27] <shadeslayer> it's a really really crappy bug .. one which requires some design decisions as well
[20:28] <shadeslayer> for eg. should we show all options? Accept/Block/Later/Deny
[20:28] <shadeslayer> or is that just too many options
[20:28] <shadeslayer> what happens when the server doesn't support one of those?
