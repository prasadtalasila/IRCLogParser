[06:13] <rick_timmis> Riddell: Good Morning jonathan, indeed we finished off the rest of the Haggis. Will try to catch up with you a little later today.
[06:14] <rick_timmis> Riddell: I'm at my desk all day today, give me a nudge when your about.
[06:44] <jackyalcine> Good luck guys, with the KF5 porting and what not.
[06:44] <jackyalcine> Looks like a hurdle.
[06:47] <shadeslayer> not exactly
[06:47] <shadeslayer> there'll be loads of spluts
[06:47] <shadeslayer> *splits
[06:47] <shadeslayer> so that's going to be a PITA to manage
[07:17] <jackyalcine> I read somewhere how the splitting might make it more convinent for devs to come and work on specific modules
[07:17] <jackyalcine> but how the versioning of KDE altogether wouldn't change.
[07:17] <jackyalcine> how is that working out?
[07:19] <shadeslayer> true and true
[07:19] <shadeslayer> well ... the same as it works out right now?
[07:20] <shadeslayer> you release the SC together
[07:20] <shadeslayer> all components follow the release cycle etc
[07:24] <jackyalcine> hm
[07:25] <jackyalcine> so just between you and me (and everyone else here, haha)
[07:25] <jackyalcine> would we ever see a KDE 5.0?
[07:29] <shadeslayer> jackyalcine: heh, there's no KDE 5.0
[07:29] <shadeslayer> meh versions
[07:29] <shadeslayer> there's KDE Frameworks 5
[07:30] <shadeslayer> the branding is getting mighty confusing now
[07:30] <shadeslayer> for eg. is there a difference between KDE SC and KDE Frameworks?
[07:48] <jackyalcine> yeah
[07:48] <jackyalcine> that's part of it
[07:48] <jackyalcine> is there any idea on how something like this would be patched up?
[07:48] <jackyalcine> wonder if Blue got something
[07:53] <shadeslayer> patched up?
[07:55] <shadeslayer> whut?
[08:08] <jackyalcine> lol sorry
[08:09] <jackyalcine> Like how would the (potential) branding issue be resolved (if it becomes too much of a problem).
[08:09] <jackyalcine> To be honest, time-related releases would be awesome. but it'd be weird jumping from KDE 4 to KDE 13 lol
[08:13] <shadeslayer> heh
[08:13] <shadeslayer> well ... I don't know myself
[08:13] <shadeslayer> I know that KDE Frameworks is a set of modules
[08:13] <shadeslayer> so you can add a framework module ontop of Qt to get extra functionality
[08:13] <shadeslayer> but I don't know how it relates to KDE SC
[08:14] <shadeslayer> and as for KDE, after the branding change, it will always refer to the community
[08:18] <jackyalcine> that's the upside
[08:18] <jackyalcine> thanks for saturating my brain, shadeslayer
[08:18] <jackyalcine> :)
[08:18] <shadeslayer> glad to :P
[08:19] <shadeslayer> I'm reasonably certain that someone here can explain KDE SC vs FF if you stick around
[08:19] <shadeslayer> everyone is sleeping probably
[08:19] <Tm_T> shadeslayer: FF?
[08:19] <Tm_T> sleep?
[08:19] <shadeslayer> oh sorry
[08:19] <shadeslayer> Frameworks Five
[08:19] <shadeslayer> FF
[08:19] <Tm_T> ah not final fantasy
[08:20] <shadeslayer> not Firefox either
[08:20] <Tm_T> Firefox is Fx
[08:20] <shadeslayer> oic
[08:20] <Tm_T> atleast that's how their FAQ said some years ago (:
[08:21] <Tm_T> anyway, frameworks are technology you build on your user level software, for example KDE sc
[08:21] <shadeslayer> hm, I thought it was the other way around
[08:21] <shadeslayer> KDE SC builds ontop of FF
[08:22] <shadeslayer> oh wait
[08:22] <shadeslayer> that's what you said :P
[08:23] <jackyalcine> lol I was thinking Fantastic Four
[08:23] <shadeslayer> Funky Funk
[08:23] <shadeslayer> KDE should name a release : KDE Funky Funk
[08:23] <shadeslayer> and go all retro
[08:23] <Tm_T> let's redo KDE 2 ?
[08:24] <Tm_T> oh wait that's almost what some people are demanding on certain development channels in time to time
[08:24] <shadeslayer> I have a Kubuntu 8.04 CD lying around somewhere
[08:24]  * shadeslayer rages at ubuntu
[08:24] <Tm_T> shadeslayer: I should have Ubuntu cds all the way from 5.04 if not 4.10 too
[08:25] <shadeslayer> it cannot run in a VM with 2GB of memory
[08:25] <Tm_T> huh
[08:30] <shadeslayer> Tm_T: http://i.imgur.com/A5h34hR.jpg
[09:21] <yofel__> good morning
[09:30] <yofel__> shadeslayer: that looks more like llvmpipe not working right
[09:30] <yofel__> last time I tried it in KVM it did work, but was slow as hell
[10:15] <hrw> hi
[10:15] <hrw> does someone here use more then 1 monitor with kde?
[10:16] <Riddell> hrw: yes
[10:16] <hrw> Riddell: is there a way to really get kde to remember their setup?
[10:17] <hrw> Riddell: here, never mind what I set in systemsettings, I end with clone
[10:17] <hrw> instead of HDMI0:auto DVI0: right of HDMI0 rotate: left
[10:18] <Riddell> hrw: yes, ignore the current tool it's pretty messy and install kscreen from https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/experimental
[10:18] <hrw> thanks
[10:18] <Riddell> it needs testers and afiestas is awaiting your feedback (also package reviews to get it into the archive)
[10:19] <hrw> ok
[10:19] <hrw> if this will not work I will revert to good old style: xorg.conf
[10:20] <Riddell> hardcore
[10:20] <hrw> but works always
[10:22] <hrw> ok. tested
[10:23] <hrw> looks like xorg.conf needs to go - radeon driver dislike rotating screen in working x11 session
[10:23] <allee> Riddell: about kscreen: there at least one issue left: what to do about the 'conflikt' with the old screen management module in kded4. 
[10:24] <allee> What has to be done is described in README.debian
[10:24] <allee> AFAIR fedora splittet the old monitor module into it's own pkg and conflicts with it
[10:24] <hrw> afiestas: please add clear information which way screen is rotated.
[10:25] <Riddell> allee: yes that's what I'm thinking
[10:25] <hrw> as "thick line at side of screen" tells me nothing
[10:25] <allee> allee: mhmm or we divert the old module 'away'
[10:25] <hrw> afiestas: 'identify screens' icon is low res and not intuitive
[10:26] <hrw> afiestas: also there is no info when screens are not snapped. 
[10:28] <hrw> afiestas: or if I want to have left in landscape (1920x1080) while right rotated (1080x1920) and snapped in the middle
[10:29] <hrw> afiestas: also buttons to enable/disable screens are non-standard
[10:31] <yofel__> afiestas: one thing that happened to be with kscreen: Turn external monitor off, wait 1s, turn it on again while kscreen is still auto-adjusting. What I got was a screen on my external monitor with the size of my notebook screen and the notebook screen was black
[10:31] <yofel__> s/to be/to me/
[10:31] <kubotu> yofel__ meant: "afiestas: one thing that happened to me with kscreen: Turn external monitor off, wait 1s, turn it on again while kscreen is still auto-adjusting. What I got was a screen on my external monitor with the size of my notebook screen and the notebook screen was black"
[10:32] <afiestas> hrw: report bugs pls
[10:32] <hrw> afiestas: will
[10:32] <afiestas> yofel__: report bugs
[10:33] <yofel__> will do later
[10:33] <hrw> but firs thave to get xorg.conf written
[10:38] <hrw> ok, restart kdm
[10:50] <hrw> afiestas: it works!
[10:52] <hrw> afiestas: where to report bugs against kscreen?
[11:01] <afiestas> hrw: usual place
[11:02] <hrw> afiestas: you mean /dev/null?
[11:03] <afiestas> hrw: bugs.kde.org
[11:03] <hrw> so same place
[11:05] <afiestas> hrw: saying that bugs.kde.org is dev/null at least in my case is insulting, I spend many hours triaging bugs
[11:05] <afiestas> so please, if you want to give feedback do so via bugzilla, if you do not want then do nothing and wait to things to get fixed
[11:05] <hrw> afiestas: sorry for that but most of bugs I reported there stayed there
[11:05] <afiestas> so what? that's not excuse
[11:05] <afiestas> we mostly develop shit in our free time doing the best you can
[11:06] <afiestas> the very least you can do is report bugs and try to do your best as we do
[11:06] <afiestas> </rant>
[11:07] <afiestas> https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?order=Importance&query_format=advanced&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=CONFIRMED&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=NEEDSINFO&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&component=common&component=kcm&component=kded&component=libkscreen&product=KScreen
[11:08] <afiestas> hrw: I challenge you to find there a bug that has not been replied, taken care of, or even fixed
[11:21] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: are you there?
[11:43] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: yes
[11:43] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: it seems the patches in the tomboy-blogposter 0.4.4 is not needed can you confirm that
[11:44] <shadeslayer> I have no idea what that package is
[11:44] <shadeslayer> but have you checked if they were applied upstream?
[11:44] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the make files are changes and there is not makefile in the source dir
[11:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the changelog says the build system is moved to automake, but building fails because of the missing makefile
[11:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  i think the problem is something else
[11:48] <shadeslayer> seems like they were applied upstream
[11:48] <shadeslayer> https://github.com/ozamosi/tomboy-blogposter/commits/master
[11:48] <shadeslayer> last 2 commits
[11:49] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: I had removed all the patches
[11:49] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: just from reading the changelog, that sounds right
[11:49] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: there is something else in the log, i will take a look at it.
[11:49] <shadeslayer> ok
[11:50] <phoenix_firebrd> make[1]: *** No rule to make target `all'.  Stop.
[12:04] <yofel__> phoenix_firebrd: that's at least missing the error context
[12:04] <yofel__> I would guess that automake failed for some other reason
[12:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: hi
[12:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: i found it
[12:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: i am editing the rules now
[12:24] <shadeslayer> yofel__: http://i.imgur.com/ZnzlGUS.png
[12:25] <shadeslayer> all in python
[12:25] <shadeslayer> and that black area actually does show your video
[12:25] <shadeslayer> it's just really dark in my room :P
[12:26] <yofel__> is that plain pyqt or qml?
[12:27] <shadeslayer> pyqt
[12:27] <yofel__> ah
[12:27] <yofel__> still nice
[12:30] <shadeslayer> yofel__: https://gist.github.com/4663893
[12:31] <shadeslayer> clone to /tmp
[12:31] <shadeslayer> too bad I can't add the videoplayer to the ui file itself
[12:32] <shadeslayer> it conflicts with the one from Qt causing stuff to crash and burn
[12:36] <yofel__> phoenix_firebrd: btw. you do know about https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek ?
[12:37] <yofel__> shadeslayer: crash and burn o.O?
[12:37] <shadeslayer> ok, crash and burn was a bit too much :P
[12:37] <shadeslayer> basically it does something really stupid
[12:37] <yofel__> heh
[12:38] <yofel__> oh, there's testing sessions tomorrow on UDW
[12:38] <yofel__> might we worth to listen to
[12:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: this is nice
[12:38] <yofel__> phoenix_firebrd: I recommend you listen to dholbach's intro sessions today
[12:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: the last 4 days where like the same
[12:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: here or in any other channel?
[12:39] <yofel__> #ubuntu-classroom, it's explained on the wiki
[12:39] <shadeslayer> I load the MediaSource into the VideoPlayer and it goes all "You're loading a KDE Phonon MediaSource into the Qt VideoPlayer!!! WTH are you trying to do?!!! "
[12:39] <shadeslayer> but the error message is completely different, it says "You're passing MediaSource to a function that accepts MediaSource"
[12:39] <yofel__> shadeslayer: lol, "Building Ubuntu images -- ogra", fun session that'll be :D
[12:40] <shadeslayer> hehe
[12:40] <shadeslayer> I plan to attend that one
[12:40] <shadeslayer> Maybe there'll be some awesome tips in there
[12:40] <shadeslayer> I also have questions
[12:41] <Riddell> worth posting that to the mailing list
[12:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: the class starts approx 2 hrs from now

[12:45] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about time utc
[12:46]  * yofel__ gives up
[12:51] <shadeslayer> yofel__: re llvmpipe, good thing that we don't do that :P
[12:51] <yofel__> about that... doesn't qt5 require opengl?
[12:51] <shadeslayer> No idea
[12:52] <shadeslayer> drat
[12:52] <shadeslayer> does anyone have a screenshot of ubiquity using your webcam?
[12:52] <shadeslayer> I need to check what the ui looks like
[12:52] <xnox> shadeslayer: yes, see slide-decks.
[12:53] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: I will take the classes,  bbl 
[12:53] <xnox> shadeslayer: or do you mean the new kde one?!
[12:53] <shadeslayer> xnox: no, the gtk one
[12:53] <shadeslayer> the KDE one still needs me connecting the signals
[12:53] <shadeslayer> after which it'll be ready
[12:53] <Riddell> shadeslayer: signals to what?
[12:53] <xnox> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubiquity/SlideDecks from there Typical install gives me https://picasaweb.google.com/105922848292507689403/1210TypicalInstall?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCOj8r6OyseCZOQ&feat=directlink#5802137264712864706
[12:53] <shadeslayer> xnox: http://i.imgur.com/ZnzlGUS.png
[12:54] <shadeslayer> Riddell: push button that saves a snapshot of the videocam to the right location or copies the png file that the user selected 
[12:54] <shadeslayer> xnox: thanx
[12:54] <Riddell> nice
[12:54] <shadeslayer> *thanks
[12:54] <xnox> shadeslayer: did that link work?
[12:54] <shadeslayer> Riddell: http://i.imgur.com/ZnzlGUS.png
[12:54]  * xnox ponders if I just leaked my authkey
[12:55] <shadeslayer> xnox: yes
[12:55] <shadeslayer> hmm
[12:55] <shadeslayer> not sure
[12:55] <Riddell> shadeslayer: ooh we should add a kubuntu logo to the defaults there
[12:55] <shadeslayer> Riddell: good point
[12:55] <shadeslayer> :D
[12:55] <shadeslayer> I can just add it in the code
[12:55] <yofel__> phoenix_firebrd: btw. tomorrow's KDE SC 4.10.0 tagging, so stay around the next few days if you want to get a feeling on how we process that. (You'll eventually get to touch it after all)
[12:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: i wont miss it for anything
[12:56]  * xnox will just make those albums public and be done with it.
[12:58] <shadeslayer> heh
[13:13] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[13:15] <Riddell> BluesKaj: testers needed for Cantata
[13:16] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: ping
[13:16] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: any ideas why something like this :
[13:16] <shadeslayer> media = Phonon.MediaSource(Phonon.BackendCapabilities.availableVideoCaptureDevices()[0])
[13:16] <shadeslayer> mediaObject = Phonon.MediaObject
[13:16] <shadeslayer> mediaObject.setCurrentSource(media)
[13:16] <shadeslayer> doesn't work?
[13:17] <shadeslayer> "TypeError: MediaObject.setCurrentSource(): first argument of unbound method must have type 'MediaObject'"
[13:18] <apachelogger> use a proper progamming language maybe?
[13:18] <shadeslayer> :P
[13:18] <shadeslayer> I'll just use videoplayer
[13:18] <BluesKaj> Riddell, what's Cantata ?
[13:19] <shadeslayer> don't care if it also captures sound
[13:19] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: I think reporting a bug is the nice way to handle this
[13:19] <shadeslayer> report a bug where?
[13:20] <Riddell> 17:55 < vassie> hello, i've packaged cantata (kde mpd client) and uploaded it to my ppa https://launchpad.net/~vassie/+archive/ppa, i would be greatful for  some feedback, thanks
[13:20] <Riddell> BluesKaj: ^^
[13:21] <tsimpson> shadeslayer: missing () after Phonon.MediaObject
[13:23] <shadeslayer> hmm
[13:23] <shadeslayer> tsimpson++
[13:24] <shadeslayer> though it's weird
[13:24] <shadeslayer> no video
[13:27] <Riddell> hi vassie 
[13:27] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: do I have to do anything after creating a path?
[13:27] <vassie> Riddell: hello
[13:28] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: http://paste.kde.org/659066/
[13:28] <Riddell> vassie: so I think we have some options with Cantata, we can just upload it, or we can patch out that first run dialogue I find so annoying
[13:29] <vassie> Riddell: sweet, being in "users" does have its benefits
[13:29] <vassie> Riddell: if you have multiple users on your system
[13:29] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: no
[13:29] <shadeslayer> hmm
[13:30] <apachelogger> https://projects.kde.org/projects/kdesupport/phonon/phonon/repository/revisions/master/entry/phonon/videoplayer.cpp#L60
[13:30] <Riddell> vassie: are you sure? cos I don't see the directories where that helps
[13:30] <apachelogger> phonon is free software don't you know
[13:30] <vassie> Riddell: i only have one user, plus i run MPD as myself so i don't need to add myself to "users"
[13:31] <shadeslayer> then I'm not sure what's missing
[13:31] <vassie> Riddell: if you set cantata to download album covers and lryics they will be owned by the "users" group
[13:31] <vassie> Riddell: but on my system MPD runs as "ben" and my .mpd folder is owned by "ben:ben"
[13:31] <yofel__> vassie: the "users" group doesn't exist by default in ubuntu though - and if someone wants to see the files they can just add that uses to their user group
[13:31] <shadeslayer> my webcam does turn on though
[13:32] <vassie> Riddell: so being in "users" does not apply, i just tick the "do not show" option and carry on
[13:32] <vassie> Riddell: i know, it is a weird one, plus the fact it was written on Kubuntu
[13:34] <Riddell> yofel__: it does seem to exist by default
[13:34] <yofel__> ah, then it's just not used the old way
[13:34] <vassie> Riddell: by the way, was my Quantal package OK?
[13:35] <Riddell> vassie: dunno I'm on raring, I'm hopeing BluesKaj will test it
[13:35] <vassie> yofel__: it's more an informational message, just a shame it pops up on first run, might scare some people
[13:36] <yofel__> yeah, it's a bit like that missing folder warnings that akonadi gave in the past because kdepim didn't set itself up properly
[13:36] <vassie> Riddell: i think i have the wrong email in quantal copyright <ben@unknown>, can it be changed or do i have to build it again?
[13:37] <Riddell> you'd have to build it again, but it's not very important
[13:37] <vassie> Riddell: ok, it does also have my correct email
[13:37] <Riddell> vassie: oh it needs a watch file
[13:38] <vassie> Riddell: ?
[13:38] <Riddell> a file which points at a webpage so automated programmes can look for new releases
[13:38] <vassie> Riddell: ok, how do i do that?
[13:39] <Riddell> find a package with a watch file and copy it :)
[13:40] <Riddell> man uscan   has the format
[13:40] <shadeslayer> ...
[13:40] <Riddell> maybe look at owncloud (first example I happened to look in)
[13:40] <shadeslayer> it's using the Qt videowidget
[13:41] <vassie> does this mean i need to rebuild both packages?
[13:43] <BluesKaj> why am I not part of the users group , that makes no sense , I'm the only user , and user management keeps crashing so i can't add my self as a user anyway
[13:44] <Riddell> vassie: no you can just give me the final packaging and I can upload it
[13:44] <BluesKaj> guess cantata testing will ahve to wait
[13:44] <vassie> from the dev "When cantata downloads images, or lyrics, and these are saved into the MPD folders - if the user is a member of the "users" group, the files will be set to belong to this group. Therefore if you have two users, they can each save files here, etc. Likewise, when copying files from devices, the files will be set to be owned by the "users" group."
[13:45] <vassie> it makes sense, but not needed if you only have one user
[13:45] <vassie> Riddell: re: watch file, still working our what i have to do :S
[13:45] <Riddell> it makes sense I'm just not convinced it's true
[13:46] <Riddell> vassie: it's faffy yes
[13:46] <vassie> if you had two users that shared a folder that contained music, if user1 and user2 are both a member of "users", then album art, etc that is downloaded by cantata would be viewable by both
[13:46] <vassie> but like i said, not needed if you only have one user
[13:47] <vassie> its a shame the app pops up that message
[13:47] <Riddell> I'm curious why /var/lib/mpd/ is owned by the "audio" group
[13:47] <Riddell> vassie: if you think it's best to get rid of it then it's a simple patch
[13:47] <vassie> i'm not sure either, but i run mpd locally, so i don't even need those folder

[13:49] <Riddell> mm, not the most user friendly bits of software
[13:49] <vassie> Riddell: mpd is fine if you run as yourself :)
[13:50] <vassie> cantata is just a front end, you don't even need mpd, i use it to control mpd on my pi
[13:51] <Riddell> it's sounding more and more like this dialogue should be patched out
[13:53] <BluesKaj> not connected to localhost , port 6600 ? what's that about , for streaming?
[13:54] <Riddell> vassie: ^^
[13:54] <vassie> BluesKaj: that is the address and port of the pc running mpd
[13:55] <vassie> BluesKaj: if mpd is already running on localhost:6600 you won't see it, or you can open the options and change the address and port
[13:56] <BluesKaj> mpd?
[13:56] <vassie> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon
[14:00]  * Riddell wanders home
[14:02] <BluesKaj> vassie, which mpd-client is recommended?
[14:03] <vassie> you can use whatever client you like http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients
[14:03] <vassie> sonata is very popular but that is a gtk app
[14:04] <BluesKaj> well, I don't know what I like , what do you use ?
[14:04] <BluesKaj> vassie, I have no idea abou these mpd clientrs 
[14:05] <vassie> i like cantata, but there is no deb for it
[14:07] <vassie> mpd can be installed wherever you like, for example i have it installed on my pi and my desktop, you then install any client to control it, i have canata on my laptop and desktop and mpdroid on my nexus 7
[14:07] <vassie> i can then control the what my desktop and pi plays
[14:07] <vassie> but again, you can use whatever client you like
[14:09] <BluesKaj> I won't bother since , the suggested ones seems to need regex which can't be found
[14:14] <shadeslayer> Riddell: is /usr/share/pixmaps/kubuntu-logo.png all we ship?

[14:36] <shadeslayer> hey Quintasan
[14:37] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: sup
[14:37] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: not much, designing the installers webcam page :) http://i.imgur.com/vmc62eI.png
[14:45] <Riddell> shadeslayer: yeah I think that's all we ship, feel free to add a bigger one
[14:46] <Riddell> Quintasan: um no sorry was I suppoesd to, I think that might have failed to stick in my memory
[14:46] <Quintasan> Riddell: Well, whatever, I got Laney to take a look at it and try getting it into Debian
[14:47] <Quintasan> Riddell: That's one less, I'll be doing maliit-plugins now
[14:47] <Quintasan> plus he got tests working
[14:50] <Riddell> vassie: so add that to the package installed into /usr/share/kde4/config/

[14:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: sure
[14:51] <vassie> Riddell: ok, i'll do it as soon as i can, don't have much free time at the moment :(
[14:51] <yofel__> phoenix_firebrd: the sessions will be logged though, so worst case you can read them later
[14:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: ya
[14:52] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: i am in the rooms
[14:55] <Riddell> howdy rick_timmis, you're wanting to get into helping kubuntu, or you do already and I've missed it?
[14:56] <BluesKaj> vassie, i nhave the canatata player linked to my media external drive /music folder , and I checked phonon sdpdif output test sounds to my amp and all is well there, but the player only shows alsa in the output section . Is the audio bypassing pulseaudio, directly to canata ?
[14:56] <rick_timmis> Riddell: Howdy JR, I am trying to find my way into helping with Kubuntu, still pretty wet behind the ears at the moment howeer.
[14:56] <Riddell> rick_timmis: yay :)
[14:57] <BluesKaj> er cantata
[14:57] <Riddell> rick_timmis: do you think you'd be into testing or packaging or coding or documenting or community support or..?
[14:58] <rick_timmis> Riddell: since xmas I have been working on my Python skills, using Quickly, and mucking about with Kdevelop. I've got most of my launchpad account setup, and have been doing a bit of testing.
[14:59] <shadeslayer> xnox: since I can't test the gtk installer, what happens when one clicks "Take a photo"
[14:59] <vassie> BluesKaj: mpd plays your music, cantata controls mpd, edit your mpd.conf file and tell it to use pulse instead of alsa
[14:59] <Riddell> shadeslayer: why can't you?
[14:59] <vassie> BluesKaj: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPD#Configuring_MPD_to_run_as_a_user_service
[14:59] <shadeslayer> Riddell: a) Not enough bandwidth to download the ISO
[14:59] <shadeslayer> b) Can't test in kvm
[14:59] <Riddell> rick_timmis: plenty of coding to be done, although that's not making life easy on yourself :)
[15:00] <shadeslayer> if you know a way to test ubiquity without downloading the ISO and directly from src, please tell me :D
[15:00] <xnox> shadeslayer: the image is added on the bottom. and then you can select it.
[15:00] <xnox> shadeslayer: there is =))))
[15:00] <shadeslayer> awesome, that's what I was thinking for the qt ui as well
[15:00] <xnox> shadeslayer: $ sudo apt-get install ubiquity ubiquity-frontend-gtk
[15:00] <shadeslayer> xnox: oh, how?
[15:01] <shadeslayer> something that won't trash my existing install :P
[15:01] <xnox> shadeslayer: then you need to make the webcam page to be before starting the install by changing
[15:01] <xnox> /usr/lib/ubiquity/plugins/ubi-webcam.py to say
[15:01] <xnox> AFTER = 'language'
[15:01] <shadeslayer> change the AFTER line?
[15:01] <shadeslayer> k
[15:01] <xnox> WEIGHT = 13
[15:01] <xnox> and then just run
[15:01] <xnox> $ ubiquity
[15:02] <xnox> from command line, it may ask for sudo password, and please do not attempt to partition or start the installation =)
[15:02] <rick_timmis> Riddell: I'm happy to tackle anything anyone wants me to really, I've got around 10 hours a week, and I work from my home office so I'm always around. Mostly I just need driection.
[15:02] <xnox> that will either fail or trash your system =)
[15:02] <xnox> shadeslayer: and that's it.
[15:02] <shadeslayer> :S
[15:02] <shadeslayer> hehe
[15:03]  * xnox has ubiquity package installed all the time. It's totally safe ;-)
[15:03] <shadeslayer> hehe
[15:03] <Riddell> rick_timmis: I've a non-GUI task to write a script to download kubuntu packages and run uscan to check for new releases
[15:04] <rick_timmis> Riddell: OK, do you have a spec, and a pointer to any extra info ?
[15:06] <Riddell> rick_timmis: mm no, but the steps are get all qt rdepends, apt-get source it, run uscan to output if there are new versions
[15:06] <Riddell> and make a nice html output
[15:08] <yofel__> Riddell: isn't the ubuntuwire page enought for that?
[15:10] <rick_timmis> Riddell: Where is the output going, into a Webpage, or do you just want a HTML file. How is it to be run, on demand, on Cron, I guess I'm saying do you want a Sysadmins Bash script, or a Modular tool ?
[15:11] <Riddell> yofel__: I'm not convinced it's very complete
[15:12] <Riddell> yofel__: e.g. where is rekonq? http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html
[15:12] <Riddell> rick_timmis: yeah a local html file
[15:13] <yofel__> that's what I wondered too, but does the watch file for rekonq work?
[15:13] <Riddell> rick_timmis: sysadmin bash is fine
[15:13] <Riddell> jr@gallus:~/src/rekonq/rekonq-2.0⚡uscan
[15:13] <Riddell> rekonq: Newer version (2.1) available on remote site: http://qa.debian.org/watch/sf.php/rekonq/rekonq-2.1.tar.bz2
[15:13] <yofel__> I noticed that muon is marked as having a broken watch file
[15:13] <Riddell> yofel__: yep
[15:13] <yofel__> (it's uscan doesn't support https)
[15:13] <yofel__> *its
[15:13] <yofel__> hm
[15:13] <Riddell> rick_timmis: debugging that ubuntuwire uehs page would be the other option
[15:13] <yofel__> I wonder what the page is supposed to be for then :/
[15:13] <Riddell> but I don't know where the source for that would be
[15:14] <shadeslayer> xnox: http://paste.kde.org/659150/
[15:14] <shadeslayer> xnox: that doesn't make the webcam page come up
[15:15] <shadeslayer> hm
[15:15] <xnox> shadeslayer: WEIGHT = 13, and then it will be the second page.
[15:16] <xnox> shadeslayer: E.g. click continue once and it should be webcam page, instead or regular "prepare / tickboxes" page.
[15:16] <shadeslayer> right
[15:16] <xnox> shadeslayer: also you should have a webcam =)
[15:16] <shadeslayer> ofcourse :P
[15:16] <xnox> (somewhere we check if you have a webcam or not)
[15:16] <shadeslayer> unfortunately, it says "Language, Prepare ..."
[15:16] <shadeslayer> no "webcam"
[15:17] <shadeslayer> maybe the kde installer has a static list of things to load?
[15:19] <rick_timmis> Riddell: OK, so we pass the script a package name, it checks dependancies, get sources, runs uscan, and outputs a HTML table of differences. Have I understood this correctly ?
[15:22] <Riddell> rick_timmis: apt-cache rdepends libkdecore5
[15:22] <Riddell> apt-get source all of them
[15:23] <Riddell> run uscan for each one
[15:23] <Riddell> output html table
[15:24] <rick_timmis> Riddell: What's the time frame for delivery. Don't so ASAP, becasue I'll panic!
[15:25] <Riddell> rick_timmis: whenever you can
[15:26] <rick_timmis> Riddell: OK, leave it with me, at the lastest I will shout an update to IRC on Tuesday next week, or any probs I'll shout those too.

[16:00] <sbivol> BluesKaj: „adduser” creates a user

[16:19] <BluesKaj> vassie, I used this command to add myself to the users group ,  sudo usermod -aG users kaj . I don't get  the "not in usrs group" warning anymore
[16:19] <shadeslayer> hmm
[16:19] <BluesKaj> err 'not in users group"
[16:19] <shadeslayer> I get a index out of range error for some reason
[16:20] <vassie> BluesKaj: i think this might be a bug, the message comes up on my Arch VM, where the only group i'm in is "users"
[16:22] <BluesKaj> altho I still have no audio with cantata .. why do i need to configure the mpd.conf ? Which doesn't exist btw 
[16:22] <BluesKaj> err ~/.mpd.conf doesn't at least
[16:24] <vassie> how have you setup mpd? globally or locally?
[16:25] <BluesKaj> my audio setup is differnt than most , i don't use analog outs to pr of pc speakers , i use spdif to an audio amp with a DAC 
[16:25] <vassie> sorry, can't help with that, i'm using pulseaudio
[16:27] <vassie> not sure if this helps http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Alsa
[16:31] <BluesKaj> vassie, yes I'm using pulse as well , it works fine with , Amarok , VLC , Dragon Player 
[16:32] <BluesKaj> but not with cantata, so far
[16:33] <vassie> for pulse, open your mpd.conf file, comment out the alsa section under audio_output
[16:33] <shadeslayer> Riddell: do you remember why you ported the installer away from KDE stuff?
[16:33] <shadeslayer> because now I get : Qt Application(15661)/phonon (KDE plugin): QDBusError("org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Disconnected", "Not connected to D-Bus server") 
[16:33] <BluesKaj> vassie, setup mpd  globally or locally? ...I don't have a mpd.conf file 
[16:33] <vassie> here is my config http://pastebin.com/0DBDU00e
[16:34] <vassie> the default mpd conf file is /etc/mpd.conf
[16:35] <BluesKaj> yes , I it would n't open without permissions , which is odd , usualy fiels will open without permissions just for read 
[16:36] <vassie> i use these instructions https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPD
[16:36] <vassie> and config mpd to run as a user service
[16:43] <shadeslayer> bah
[16:44] <shadeslayer> I can't use kapplication because of dbus issues
[16:44] <shadeslayer> what a pointless waste of time this has been
[16:56] <vassie> right, i'm off, have a good evening
[16:58] <Riddell> shadeslayer: well that's presumably caused by it not being connected to dbus?
[17:11] <Riddell> shadeslayer: I had to port it away because it didn't like using dbus in the pre-login session of the live image
[17:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: the classes are very basic

[17:15] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__: i disagree
[17:17] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel__:  I have to know about the debian/rules. when do you have spare time?
[17:18] <yofel__> In 2h maybe, right now I'm still sitting at work and trying to finish something so I can finally go home...

[17:19] <yofel__> ping me when you have time there, tomorrow I'll be more flexible

[21:51] <apachelogger> though

[21:52] <apachelogger> yofel_: no
[21:52] <apachelogger> because python is awesome and change that shit in 3.2
[21:52] <yofel_> ah, cool... *sigh*
[21:53] <apachelogger> also I'd try that first
[21:53] <yofel_> I'll do that now

[23:33] <ScottK> I checked the update script in kubuntu-meta and it claimed no changes.

[23:38] <Riddell> ScottK: kpat seems the likely next candidate
[23:38] <ScottK> Agreed
[23:39] <ScottK> That'll also get rid of the kdegames libs and the card set.
