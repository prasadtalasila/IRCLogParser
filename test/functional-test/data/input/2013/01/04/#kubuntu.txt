[00:43] <Daz646> Happy new year everyone, would anyone mind telling me how i can make an existing disk imagine of my current kubuntu configuration etc? I am using kubuntu 12.10 64bit. Many Thanks.
[00:43] <Daz646> image**
[00:49] <Doomhammer> what's the technique to install 64-bit flash plugin? apt-get install flashplugin-installer seems to not do it
[00:52] <Torch> Daz646: _configuration_ or _installation_?
[00:52] <Daz646> Torch: is it possible to do both?
[00:53] <Torch> Daz646: i guess, yes.
[00:53] <Torch> Daz646: question is what you really want to achieve
[00:54] <Daz646> Torch: In case i have to format my harddrive or something, it would be just pretty convienient to just put a disk in and stall it from like a checkpoint type of thing. Sorry a little new to linux.
[00:55] <Torch> Daz646: and it re-installs all packages and sets up the configuration the way it has been?
[00:55] <Daz646> Torch: Yes, ive have spent a long time messing around configuring the interface as a learning curve and i have it exactly how i like it.
[00:56] <Torch> Daz646: first thing: separate home partition
[00:56] <Daz646> Torch: ok
[00:56] <Torch> Daz646: so if you lose your root partition, you don't lose your configuration for the users
[00:56] <Torch> Daz646: you _still_ have to install the packages, of course
[00:56] <Daz646> Torch: Yes that's no problem :)
[00:56] <Torch> google turns up this: http://fai-project.org/
[00:57] <Torch> can't say if it works and how well
[00:58] <Daz646> No problem, appreciated. Messing things up is part of me learning so either way its all good :). Thanks again!

[04:40] <Samizdatguy> I think I uninstalled kde, but can't mount my HD from shell to fix the issue.
[04:40] <Samizdatguy> I get an error about specifying file system.
[04:43] <Obsidian1723> That doesn;t make sense.
[04:43] <Samizdatguy> Yeah, I know.
[04:43] <Obsidian1723> the K Desktop Environment is a DE and doesn't have anything to do really with the file system or the OS itself.
[04:44] <Obsidian1723> What do you see if you do df -h
[04:44] <Obsidian1723> Does it show the paritions, Ext4 and / and so forth?
[04:45] <Samizdatguy> I'm seeing partitions, but my HD shows up as /dev/mapper/kubunut-root
[04:45] <Samizdatguy> I'm on a live CD now.
[04:46] <Obsidian1723> Have you tried to unmount / and then run fsck to fix it?
[04:46] <Samizdatguy> Yeah. It wouldn't work.
[04:47] <Samizdatguy> I think I can get to my /home/ actually.
[04:47] <Samizdatguy> I'll back it up and reformat, I guess.
[04:47] <Obsidian1723> fsck wont work?
[04:48] <Samizdatguy> How do I run it?
[04:48] <Obsidian1723> Here's part of a script I wrote which may help.... run this segment first:
[04:48] <Obsidian1723> mount -n -o remount,ro / && df -hT && cd $HOME/$user && touch write-test.txt && ls $HOME/$user | grep write-test.txt && echo I have performed a test to see if the main partition and hard drive is indeed in read-only mode. To verify that it is in read-only mode look at the listing of your home directory and IF YOU DO NOT SEE "write-test.txt" in your home directory and you see an error stating "cannot create file" then you are ok to proceed
[04:49] <Obsidian1723> with the next step and check the drive. IF you DO see the file "write-test.txt" - DO NOT PROCEED WITH THE NEXT STEP. YOUR DRIVE IS NOT IN READ-ONLY MODE. MAKE IT READ ONLY FIRST!! This message will clear in 15 seconds and you will be given the next command to run to actually check the drive.
[04:49] <FloodBotK1> Obsidian1723: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[04:49] <Obsidian1723> whoops
[04:49] <Samizdatguy> I can't, actually.
[04:49] <Obsidian1723> then do this: (and you can leave off sudo if you are already root # ) sudo /sbin/fsck -y -f -v /
[04:49] <Samizdatguy> I'm on my tablet here.
[04:50] <Obsidian1723> I thought you were on the system via a live cd?
[04:50] <Samizdatguy> Didn;t seem to do anything.
[04:50] <Samizdatguy> :(
[04:51] <Samizdatguy> Thanks man, but I think a clean install is gonna be the way to go.
[04:51] <Obsidian1723> then you did it wrong. No offense, but that works.
[04:51] <Samizdatguy> I can get my home of the thing now.
[04:51] <Obsidian1723> Well, then just nuke and pave, reinstall, replace home
[04:52] <Samizdatguy> It just read fsck from util-linux 2.20.1
[04:52] <Samizdatguy> Can I just shove my /home/ back in place after a reinstall?
[04:53] <Obsidian1723> I wouldn't
[04:53] <Samizdatguy> Move things one by one, huh?
[04:53] <Obsidian1723> There are files you can copy over with yuour settings and of course your personal files.
[04:54] <Obsidian1723> Well, one thing you can do is unmount /home and then reinstall the OS, then remount /home , but that assumes /home is on not just another parition, but another drive. If you're getting inode errors or something where you need to nuke the drive and everything is all on one drive, that's not going to work to just unmount and remount /home
[04:55] <Obsidian1723> / tmp /etc /bin and /var and /home are all paritions that can exist on one drive.... what I was talking about is that same setupo, but with /home partition being on another logical drive.
[04:55] <Obsidian1723> You don't have it setup like that do you?
[04:56] <Samizdatguy> Nope. :)
[04:56] <Obsidian1723> yeah, backup your settings for kde and your personal files, N&P, reinstall, move the certain files back.
[04:56] <Obsidian1723> That's going to be the cleanest I think.
[04:57] <Samizdatguy> I have no idea what I erased trying to roll back an upgrade.
[04:57] <Obsidian1723> obviously use the same username or else you need to chown a bunch of stuff.
[04:57] <Obsidian1723> What did you upgrade from and to?
[04:58] <Samizdatguy> I get unable to launch "/usr/bin/startkde" X session  not found
[04:58] <Samizdatguy> When I try to boot.
[04:58] <Obsidian1723> Have you tried to reconfigure x?
[04:58] <Samizdatguy> No.
[04:58] <Samizdatguy> How would I do that?
[04:59] <Obsidian1723> sudo dpkg-reconfigure packagename
[04:59] <Obsidian1723> so in this case, xserver-org
[04:59] <Samizdatguy> That's like a reinstall of X?
[05:00] <Obsidian1723> I typoed: xserver-xorg
[05:00] <Obsidian1723> Not a reinstall, a reconfiogure
[05:00] <Obsidian1723> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:00] <Samizdatguy> One sec, booting back on live cd.
[05:00] <Obsidian1723> ok
[05:00] <Obsidian1723> You can reinstall, but that's a different deal. a reconfigure just sets it back to factory default, so to speak.
[05:00] <Samizdatguy> Ah.
[05:01] <Samizdatguy> If I run this from a live CD, will the changes get written to my hd?
[05:02] <Obsidian1723> ah eff.. thats right you areu sing the live cd
[05:02] <Obsidian1723> that wont work.
[05:02] <Obsidian1723> You need to configure the x on your pc, not on the live cd.
[05:02] <Obsidian1723> Is gparted on that live cd?
[05:02] <Samizdatguy> I can get into shell recovery, but not with networking.
[05:03] <Samizdatguy> How can I mount my ethernet from CLI?
[05:03] <Obsidian1723> Using it you can unmount yoyur hard drive, force a disk check, reboot, eject the live cd, let the system boot upo, see if it works or if it dumps you to a shell. If it dumps to shell, reconfigure x and reboot.

[05:05] <Samizdatguy> I have KDE partition manager.
[05:05] <Obsidian1723> sudo /etc/init.d/networking start
[05:06] <Obsidian1723> Well, you can install gparted on the live cd. It will go away on reboot, but you can do it.
[05:06] <Obsidian1723> sudo apt-get install gparted
[05:06] <Obsidian1723> then sudo gparted
[05:06] <Obsidian1723> then do what I said to do with it.
[05:08] <Samizdatguy> Okay, I'm in gparted
[05:09] <Samizdatguy> It looks like I'm listed as a lvm2 pv file system
[05:09] <Samizdatguy> Obsidian1723
[05:10] <Samizdatguy> I can boot into recovery shell from the live CD.
[05:11] <Obsidian1723> that is on the live cd I think
[05:11] <Obsidian1723> You need to locate your internal hard drive.
[05:11] <Samizdatguy> Oh, wait, I meant from grub.
[05:11] <Samizdatguy> Via advnced options.
[05:12] <Obsidian1723> If you have your /home backed up, it may be just faster to nuke and pave. Im sure I could fix it if I were there or had remote access, but I don't.
[05:13] <Samizdatguy> I think so too.
[05:13] <Samizdatguy> This is gonna be a mess, thanks fro your help.
[05:13] <Samizdatguy> :)
[05:17] <Obsidian1723> No problem. there's just only so much I can do this way.
[05:17] <Obsidian1723> Best way to know how to use Linux is to fix it.
[05:17] <Obsidian1723> Does your PC have 2 hard drives on it?
[05:18] <Samizdatguy> I have an external

[15:17] <andybrine> Hello everyone
[15:17] <andybrine> has anyone managed to get photoshop cs6 working in ubuntu?
[15:19] <shadeslayer> have you checked wine?
[15:19] <shadeslayer> otoh you should use inkscape/gimp\
[15:25] <andybrine> lol
[15:26] <andybrine> i do use gimp and inkscape
[15:26] <andybrine> not a huge fan of inkscape but do like gimp
[15:26] <TheLordOfTime> andybrine, you may want to first check if its compatible with wine
[15:26] <andybrine> i would just like to go back to using photoshop
[15:26] <TheLordOfTime> andybrine, i've heard weird things about photoshop on wine, esp. since CS6
[15:26] <TheLordOfTime> !wine

[15:26] <andybrine> i have had a quick search online

[15:27] <TheLordOfTime> if it works there, then install wine and then use wine to run the installer
[15:27] <TheLordOfTime> s/works/is listed there that it works (at least "Silver")/
[15:27] <andybrine> i know people here always offer great advise and so thought i would ask here first
[15:27] <TheLordOfTime> of course, i'm against closed-source stuff so...
[15:27] <TheLordOfTime> keep that in mind ;)
[15:28] <andybrine> lol
[15:28] <andybrine> tbh im am against closed stuff as well
[15:29] <andybrine> though photoshop is incredible and it looks like they will not be comeing to linux anytime soon

[22:05] <Wizard> Good evening.
[22:28] <meoblast001> hi. has anyone ever had this issue with Firefox in KDE? after coming from an Ubuntu system, i overwrote my system partition and kept my home partition, so all my Firefox settings are in place
[22:29] <meoblast001> it can't seem to ever remember how to open particular files
[22:29] <meoblast001> and Thunderbird can't remember how to open links (default browser)
[22:29] <meoblast001> is this fixable or something i just have to live with?
[22:57] <cham> my cd/dvd is not recognized in kubuntu or brasero
[23:05] <Wizard> cham: How is it possible?
[23:05] <Wizard> DOes /dev/cdrw exist?
[23:06] <cham> Wizard yeah
[23:08] <Wizard> Hmm, what about its rights?
[23:09] <cham> you mean chmod ?
[23:10] <Wizard> No, I mean rights.
[23:10] <Wizard> And what does really "not recognized" mean?
[23:12] <cham> i meant brasero asks for an empty disc to write on, despite i inserted one, and dolphine doesn't show the cd/dvd
[23:13] <Wizard> Dolphin won't show blank cd/dvd
[23:14] <cham> yeah both blank and written
[23:16] <Wizard> Oh.
[23:16] <Wizard> You have to mount written CD first.
[23:17] <Wizard> Either clicking on left panel in Dolphin or using device notifier.
[23:46] <RaphaelBarros> Hey guys, is there any dock for KDE that is being constantly developed? I mean, there are some on opendesktop.com, but they haven't be updated for more than 7 months.
[23:48] <cham> Wizard i managed to mount a written CD, what now ?
[23:52] <sithlord48> RaphaelBarros: what kind of dock are you looking for ?
[23:57] <RaphaelBarros> elementaryOS like, or something like Icon-Only Task Manager, but where I can put my desktop and trash icons without them scaling diffrently from the icons on the icon-only task manager (there are some icons that don't stay on the dock, like Blender :{ )
[23:57] <sithlord48> RaphaelBarros: i think your best bet is icon-only task manager.
[23:58] <RaphaelBarros> That's what I'm using :P
