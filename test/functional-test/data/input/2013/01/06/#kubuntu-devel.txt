[01:32] <sakang> not sure why plasma* and workspace* are still at 4.9.95 instead of .97 in 13.04? plus a bunch of other stuff.  nothing held back so not sure what's going on.. any ideas?
[01:33] <yofel> sakang: until everything is built it's stuck in raring-proposed, you'll have to wait a bit
[01:36] <sakang> yofel: thanks..that explains it..the announcement in kde.org and kubuntu.org jumped the gun then.  for a while I thought something broke in my system.
[01:49] <Mamarok> claydoh: *sigh*
[01:50] <claydoh> Mamarok: double *sigh*
[01:50] <Mamarok> should I send a mail to Leslie Anne? Sad to see here go
[01:52] <claydoh> I am thinking of it, I would like her to stay, she did unsubscribe. 
[01:53] <Mamarok> I am writing a PM now
[01:57] <claydoh> Mamarok: :) 
[02:00] <Mamarok> claydoh: OK, mail sent
[02:02] <Mamarok> now what with Basil?
[02:07] <Mamarok> I set him to moderation as well
[02:13] <claydoh> ok  mod is fine, let them cool off
[02:13] <claydoh> on either "side"
[02:32] <Mamarok> indeed. I am going to bed now, tomorrow is another day :)
[02:32] <Mamarok> claydoh: thanks and have a nice day :)
[02:35] <claydoh> Mamarok: sleep well ;) 
[02:53] <xnox> ScottK: do you care about keeping python-qt4 packaging to still work with non-multiarched python2/3, e.g. for backports?!
[02:53] <ScottK> xnox: It's not essential.
[02:56] <xnox> ScottK: ok. If need be, it will be trivial to keep 2 line diff, or make it more "dynamic" =)
[03:32] <xnox> left the build running, will commit when I wake up for sunday =)

[13:38] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: I have a mindblock when coding on paper
[13:53] <shadeslayer> not sure what's happnening but backportpackage isn't working as well
[13:54] <shadeslayer> micahg: any news on transmission stuff?
[13:58] <soee> shadeslayer, what backportpackage ?
[13:58] <shadeslayer> it's a tool to backport packages
[13:58] <shadeslayer> Trying to backport ktp 0.5.2 to precise
[13:58] <shadeslayer> but it's timing out
[17:57] <micahg> shadeslayer: ah, I should've done that last night...I'll do it later today
[17:57] <shadeslayer> micahg: thx :)
[17:58] <soee> where kde settings are stored (windows configurations etc)?
[17:58] <shadeslayer> soee: ~/.kde
[17:59] <shadeslayer> and some stuff is in ~/.local and ~/.config as well
[17:59] <shadeslayer> for eg. if you use qtcurve, the current qtcruve is stored in ~/.config
[18:00] <shadeslayer> but most of it is in ~/.kde/share/config
[18:00] <soee> i would like to send current settings to ubuntu one for example so i can use them on my machine @ work, home, laptop etv
[18:00] <soee> ok so i think ~/.kde
[18:00] <dilfridge> hi
[18:00] <soee> is what i want
[18:00] <shadeslayer> sure, but make sure you don't share cache links and what not
[18:00] <soee> hi dilfridge 
[18:00] <shadeslayer> there is alot of stuff in ~/.kde
[18:00] <dilfridge> is there any admin of kubuntuforums.net here?
[18:01] <shadeslayer> SteveRiley: ^
[18:01] <soee> ok, thank you shadeslayer 
[18:01] <shadeslayer> np :)
[18:01] <dilfridge> thanks
[18:02] <shadeslayer> dilfridge: I haven't seen SteveRiley active alot, so you might just want to say what the issue is and maybe someone else notices
[18:02] <shadeslayer> iirc Darkwing_ was also an admin there, not sure
[18:03] <soee> dilfridge, do you hve 403 on that page ?
[18:03] <dilfridge> yes
[18:06] <dilfridge> SteveRiley: I'm getting 403 on kubuntuforums.net (eg issue 38317, Problematic Russian Netblock (IP-042)). Not Russia here, definitely Ping me if you need any info, e-mail dilfridge@gentoo.or works too... TIA!
[18:42] <claydoh> dilfridge:  iiit may be our security stuff being too aggressive, we used to be flooded with pr0n daily I will look and ask 
[18:42] <claydoh> I am an admin there
[18:48] <claydoh> dilfridge: I am guessing we might need an ip address, you can poke me or snowhog on #kfn 
[19:16] <Quintasan> Riddell: How do you think we handle bsns card printing?
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio__
[20:21] <Riddell> Quintasan: what is nsns card printing?
[20:21] <Riddell> Quintasan: what is bsns card printing?
[20:34] <Quintasan> Riddell: Do we have some budget for business cards or we just got designs and whoever wants those has to print them themselves?
[20:37] <Riddell> Quintasan: we have plenty money in the bank, so I don't think money is an issue
[20:39] <Quintasan> Riddell: You think we could just gather info from people who are interested and then one of us orders X*Y (X - number of peopl Y - number of business cards) cards and then distributes them?
[20:39] <Quintasan> Or it's going to be "have them printed, show receipt and we will reimburse you" ?
[20:41] <Riddell> Quintasan: possibly I could pay with my card and reimburse myself
[20:41] <Riddell> instaprint looked like a promising candidate for printing
[20:42] <Quintasan> Riddell: And then you would distribute them among interested people? Sounds good.
[20:42] <Quintasan> About prining service, I have no idea. I never did any printing aside from printing stuff for school so I'll pass on making suggestions about which service to use
[20:43] <Quintasan> Riddell: http://www.instaprint.co.uk/?
[20:44] <Riddell> yeah
[20:45] <Quintasan> standard business card sizes, paper grammature
[20:45] <Quintasan> well
[20:45] <Quintasan> nothing too complicated there I think
[20:45] <Quintasan> but I don't think we need anything complicated
[20:45] <Riddell> nope
[20:47] <Quintasan> Riddell: How do you propose getting information which is to be put on the card? I think one could post a mail to our ML to contact you with information.
[20:48] <Riddell> yeah, any kubuntu members please send name, address, etc etc
[21:07] <ScottK> afiestas: reverting that commit seems to have resolved the brightness flickering issues we were seeing in 4.9.  I think reverting it in 4.10 before release makes sense too.  I can write the KDE release list if you'd prefer a discussion there?

[21:42] <Quintasan> yofel_: you alive?
[21:42] <yofel_> more or less
[21:42] <Quintasan> yofel_: mind helping with pointer logic?
[21:43] <yofel_> well, throw it against me and worst case I'll attempt to summon harald
[21:43] <Quintasan> it's homework, not mine but I'm curious
[21:43] <Quintasan> http://wklej.org/id/917007/
[21:43] <Quintasan> this
[21:43] <Quintasan> when I do nPtr++ it should jump to the NEXT element of the array, right?
[21:44] <yofel_> it should if I remember it right
[21:44] <Quintasan> float size is 4 here
[21:45] <Quintasan> if I do nPtr+8
[21:45] <Quintasan> it jumps 4 elements
[21:45] <Quintasan> at first I thought it would jump 8 elements but I dismissed it as dumb
[21:46] <Quintasan> then I thought it would jump 2 elemnts since float size is 4 and we are adding 8
[21:46] <Quintasan> but it jumped 4 elements
[21:46] <Quintasan> what the
[21:47] <Quintasan> wait
[21:47] <Quintasan> what
[21:47] <yofel_> http://paste.kde.org/639092 prints 1.10000 as expected
[21:48] <Quintasan> hmm
[21:48] <Quintasan> the tasks asks you exactly
[21:49] <Quintasan> copypasta in polish
[21:49] <Quintasan> Zakładając, że nPtr wskazuje początek tablicy liczby, jaki adres jest określany przez
[21:49] <Quintasan> nPtr+8? Jaka znajduje się tam wartość?
[21:49] <Quintasan> Assuming
[21:49] <Quintasan> nPtr is pointing the the beggining of the array
[21:49] <Quintasan> to what address is nPtr+8 pointing to, what value is stored there
[21:49] <Quintasan> He doesn't do *(nPtr+8) there
[21:50] <Quintasan> I imagine those to be wildly different since what I was to cout << nPtr+8 and it gave the address of the 4 element of the array
[21:50] <yofel_> as nPtr is a pointer to float, it should be the same as 8*sizeof(float) if it were void*
[21:51] <Quintasan> lol
[21:51] <Quintasan> so we are actually adding 24?
[21:51] <yofel_> internally yes
[21:51] <Quintasan> if float is 4 bytes
[21:53] <Quintasan> sooo
[21:54] <Quintasan> if I put it indexes it would be a jump from liczby[0] to liczby[4]
[21:54] <Quintasan> right?
[21:56] <yofel_> give me a bit to make sense of what gcc is throwing at me here
[21:56] <yofel_> wait
[21:56] <yofel_> nvm
[21:56] <yofel_> 8 * 4 = 32
[21:56] <Quintasan> wat
[21:56] <Quintasan> really
[21:57] <yofel_> so 863806976 + 8 = 863807008 
[21:57]  * Quintasan needs to learn multiplying
[21:57] <yofel_> in float pointer arithmetic
[21:58] <Quintasan> sooooo
[21:59] <Quintasan> TBH I though adding 8 would make it point to the curr_adress+2
[21:59] <Quintasan> since float is 4 bytes
[22:00] <Quintasan> now it turns out it's actually adding 32 to the adress and that is probably after the array boundary
[22:00] <yofel_> no
[22:00] <yofel_> addr + 4 in plain bytes would be libczby[1]
[22:01] <yofel_> addr + 32 is liczby[8]
[22:01] <yofel_> note that you're defining nPtr as *float
[22:01] <yofel_> if you want it to count in 1 byte steps use *void
[22:01] <yofel_> as it takes the data size into account
[22:02] <yofel_> that's why I said it does + sizeof(type) internally
[22:02] <Quintasan> so nPtr+8 is actually *(nPtr+32) ?
[22:02] <yofel_> + val*sizeof(type)
[22:02] <yofel_> nPtr + 8 as flot would be nPtr + 32 as void
[22:06] <Quintasan> so assuming nPtr i pointing at liczby[0]
[22:06] <Quintasan> nPtr+8 will make it point to liczby[8]?
[22:06] <Quintasan> this is...logical?
[22:06] <Quintasan> I have no idea why they make a big deal out of this
[22:07] <yofel_> uh... it's only logical if you know hat C takes he pointer type into account for pointer arithmetics
[22:09] <Quintasan> it would be illogical if it didnt imo
[22:09] <Quintasan> more hax
[22:10] <Quintasan> int ∗ s t ;
[22:10] <Quintasan> ∗ st = 100;
[22:10] <Quintasan> is this correct?
[22:10] <Quintasan> st is a pointer
[22:10] <yofel_> yeah
[22:10]  * Quintasan always confuses the damn symbols
[22:10] <Quintasan> int *st; is easy it creates a pointer
[22:10] <Quintasan> what the hell does *st = 100 do?
[22:11] <yofel_> put 100 into the memory that st points to
[22:11] <Quintasan> but st doesnt point at anything
[22:11] <Quintasan> so this is not correct code at all
[22:12] <yofel_> well, that's YOUR fault
[22:12] <Quintasan> :D
[22:12]  * Quintasan didn't write this
[22:12] <yofel_> c.c:10:15: warning: ‘st’ is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
[22:13] <yofel_> enjoy debugging later
[22:13] <Quintasan> clang++ is retarded
[22:13] <Quintasan> no error here
[22:13] <Quintasan> or even warning
[22:14] <yofel_> -Wall:
[22:14] <yofel_> c.c:11:12: warning: variable 'st' is uninitialized when used here [-Wuninitialized]
[22:14] <yofel_>           *st = 100;
[22:14] <yofel_>            ^~
[22:14] <yofel_> c.c:9:18: note: initialize the variable 'st' to silence this warning
[22:14] <yofel_>           int* st;
[22:14] <yofel_>                  ^
[22:14] <Quintasan> why doesn't c++ compiler throw an warning ._.
[22:14] <yofel_>                   = NULL
[22:14] <Quintasan> oh
[22:14] <yofel_> you do know that -Wuninitialized is not on by default?
[22:15] <Quintasan> NO
[22:15] <Quintasan> and I have no idea why
[22:15] <yofel_> :D
[22:15] <Quintasan> would you do this
[22:15] <Quintasan> isn't it a good idea to turn this on by default?
[22:15] <yofel_> well, I have aliases that do that
[22:15] <yofel_> as I do want to have it on by default
[22:15] <Quintasan> I mean generally you don't want pointers doing MAGIC on some random memory address
[22:16] <Quintasan> not even random as I think pointer after initialization points to NULL
[22:16] <Quintasan> at least in c++
[22:17] <yofel_> FUN
[22:17] <yofel_> clang c.c
[22:17] <yofel_> run it: works fine
[22:17] <yofel_> gcc c.c
[22:17] <yofel_> run it: SIGSEGV
[22:17] <Quintasan> Lol
[22:17] <Quintasan> also
[22:17] <Quintasan> OLOLOLOASDOASDKASFKA
[22:17] <Quintasan> look at this
[22:17] <yofel_> clang does an implicit malloc I guess
[22:17] <Quintasan> a = ∗&∗&∗&∗&a ;
[22:18] <Quintasan> they ask you if it will compile and execture
[22:18] <yofel_> lol
[22:18] <Quintasan> :D
[22:18] <yofel_> considering *& compiles, it should
[22:18] <Quintasan> random guess - it will
[22:18] <Quintasan> if I try to print a it will print 5
