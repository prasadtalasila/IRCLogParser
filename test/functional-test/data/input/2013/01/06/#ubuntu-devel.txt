[01:48] <Aeyoun> This is really not encouraging. http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/singlehtml/index.html#submitting-for-inclusion "You've done lots of work following this wiki, and now you need to learn a bunch of new stuff and do things slightly differently over at this other place."

[04:34] <micahg> doko__: nevermind about icedtea-web, I see it's dependent on which release you generate the control file on, not which one it's targeted too (which is a bit fragile, but I worked around it)

[11:13] <mitya57> Logan_: can you please mark lp:~logan/ubuntu/raring/ocfs2-tools/debian-merge as merged (so that it doesn't show in the sponsoring queue)?
[11:14] <Logan_> mitya57: Hmm, but it's not merged, though.
[11:14] <Logan_> I'll set it as Work in progress.
[11:16] <mitya57> Logan_: there was upload authored by you: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+source/ocfs2-tools/1.6.4-2ubuntu1
[11:16] <Logan_> Well fancy that.
[11:17] <Logan_> Okay, marked as Merged. :P
[11:17] <mitya57> thanks!
[11:18]  * mitya57 wishes Logan_ becomes Ubuntu developer soon :)
[11:19] <Logan_> Haha, same here. I'm actually planning on applying for MOTU, which would gain me Ubuntu membership in the process.

[14:11] <nrosvall_> hi is there plans to disable menu icons from Qt apps?
[14:11] <nrosvall_> as now gtk apps do not show menu icons by default in unity, but Qt apps do
[14:12] <nrosvall_> I guess that needs some qt dconf integration?

[17:48] <Bluefoxicy> â€œIn terms of software, Ubuntu is like the iPhone" <-- too much proprietary, in-house software and an extreme habit of not playing well with others while telling everyone you play well with everyone?
[17:48] <Bluefoxicy> http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/why-use-ubuntu
[17:49] <Bluefoxicy> (A Nexus phone is probably a more favorable comparison, though with Unity and Upstart people will argue about whether or not it's a more accurate comparison)
[17:56] <maxb>  That is a rather a bizarre quote
[17:57] <maxb> I'd dismiss it a just being something said by a newspaper, but having it requoted on ubuntu.com makes it more prominent
[17:59] <maxb> Thdn again, more people who use a nexus phone can probably figure out if they'd like to use ubuntu all by themselves, so maybe its a deliberate attempt to seed curiosity in a particular market segment
