=== Tonio__ is now known as Tonio_
[08:40] <shadeslayer> but then all my uni friends have moved out
[08:40] <shadeslayer> and I'm still at home working
[08:41] <shadeslayer> so that's a bit depressing
[08:41] <shadeslayer> who runs precise btw?

[08:41] <shadeslayer> yep
[08:41] <RagnaRok__> I do.. :P
[08:41] <lordievader> I do.
[08:42] <shadeslayer> alright
[08:42] <shadeslayer> I'm going to try and backport 4.10 to precise
[08:42] <shadeslayer> once it's built I'm going to put it in the staging repo
[08:43] <Wizard> :)
[08:43] <shadeslayer> Testers would be welcome :)

[11:02] <swarfega> if there is a /lib and a /lib32 folder do 64-bit files go in /lib?
[11:04] <tsimpson> /lib is for native, /lib32 is for the 32bit libs on 64bit, /lib64 is for 64bit libs on 32bit
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[11:14] <m477> do you know how I can find TeX search path? (on 12.04)
[11:16] <swarfega> hmm there isnt a /lib64 though, do you just make one?
[11:16] <tsimpson> swarfega: you don't need /lib64 on a 64bit OS, only on the 32bit one

[17:27] <rishubh> ??
[17:28] <rishubh> its not allowin me to select the wireless option in network
[18:04] <kubuntuser> hello
[18:05] <kubuntuser> can you help me with kubuntu 13.04 ?
[18:07] <BluesKaj> kubuntuser, ask your question
[18:08] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: i have an overheating problem
[18:08] <BluesKaj> laptop ?
[18:08] <kubuntuser> yes
[18:08] <kubuntuser> only with kubuntu
[18:09] <BluesKaj> are you using it for work or home or both , kubuntuser ?
[18:09] <kubuntuser> home
[18:09] <kubuntuser> why ?
[18:10] <BluesKaj> ok , kubuntuser , because the file indexer is probly running, and the akonadi server for kmail and kontact might also be enabled using up resources and cpu which creates heat
[18:10] <kubuntuser> how to stop it ?
[18:12] <BluesKaj> kmenu>computer system settings>desktop search , disable that  first
[18:13] <kubuntuser> thanks
[18:13] <kubuntuser> only this ?
[18:14] <BluesKaj> You can disable akonadi in system settings>startup&shutdown>service manager ,nepomuk search module (tied to akonadi), uncheck that.Then in session mangement, check "restore previous session" and add akonadi, nepomuk to the "applicationsto be excluded from sessions" text
[18:15] <BluesKaj> ypu already done the nepomuk part  , so do the seesion management part
[18:17] <kubuntuser> thanks
[18:17] <kubuntuser> i do that :)
[18:17] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: seems not this the problem..
[18:17] <Wizard> Hi BluesKaj.
[18:18] <BluesKaj> it should help keep your cpu cycles to minimim , kubuntuser
[18:18] <BluesKaj> Wizard, hi
[18:18] <BluesKaj> kubuntuser, logout aqnd back in
[18:19] <Wizard> There and back again ;D
[18:19] <kubuntuser> oh ok
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[18:29] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: fan is in high mode mmm
[18:29] <BluesKaj> kubuntuser, have you tried the power settings in system settings?
[18:31] <BluesKaj> and make sure you have an airspace under the laptop for asir circulation/fan cooling
[18:31] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: you mean power management ?
[18:31] <BluesKaj> yes
[18:32] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: i think it's the graphic card..
=== pjoe_afk is now known as pjoe
[18:32] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: because i have two graphic cards
[18:33] <BluesKaj> Optimus ?
[18:33] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: no
[18:33] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: ati + intel
[18:34] <BluesKaj> low and high graphics modes ?
[18:34] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: switchable
[18:34] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: oh wait
[18:35] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: now fan is good
[18:35] <BluesKaj> which laptop kubuntuser ?
[18:35] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: hp dv6
[18:36] <kubuntuser> BluesKaj: how can i see what graphic card is in use ?
[18:38] <fdm391> in terminal do:   cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch
[18:39] <kubuntuser> 0:DIS: :Pwr:0000:01:00.0
[18:40] <kubuntuser> 1:IGD:+:Pwr:0000:00:02.0
[18:40] <kubuntuser> ?
[18:40] <fdm391> well, the + means that the IGD (integrated graphics card - the Intel one) is in use
[18:40] <kubuntuser> oh thanks fdm391
[18:40] <fdm391> DIS (Discrete is the ATI card)
[18:40] <fdm391> both are on...
[18:41] <kubuntuser> i want to use intel because is good for fan
[18:41] <fdm391> you should turn the one that is not being used off
[18:41] <fdm391> if you keep both on, your laptop will overheat easily
[18:41] <kubuntuser> fdm391: how can i disable ?
[18:42] <fdm391> in terminal do:     echo "OFF" > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch
[18:42] <kubuntuser> fdm391: done thanks
[18:42] <fdm391> i once owned a hp g62, which is similar to yours (hardware-wise) and it was a pain getting it to work with linux
[18:43] <fdm391> if you do the cat-command now, it should show Off for the DIS line
[18:43] <BluesKaj> dual graphics is pita on linux , even bumble bee doesn't help on a lot  of them
[18:44] <fdm391> bumble bee is for nvidia switchable graphics afaik
[18:44] <fdm391> vga_switcheroo works, sort of.. You can't switch inside X though
[18:45] <BluesKaj> afaik it doesn't work very well for the optimus / nvidia setups either
[18:45] <BluesKaj> bumblebee that is
[18:47] <BluesKaj> brb
[18:47] <fdm391> well, on these HP laptops, it's even more of a problem because they tend to overheat when both cards are on at the same time
[18:47] <fdm391> well, at least mine did.. :)
[18:56] <supergino> hi all folks
[18:56] <supergino> what's up?
[18:57] <sbivol> hi all! I have a question regarding Quassel IRC. Can it be configured to load IRC history from the server (and is that even possible)? I see a Backlog option in QUassel, but I think it loads history from local log, not from the server.  My intention is to load the last ~50 messages that I miss when offline so I.
[18:58] <supergino> re hi all folks
[18:58] <sbivol> ... so I can haev a clue what people were talking about before I joined
[18:58] <tsimpson> sbivol: if you mean quassel-client package, then it does load them from the server
[18:59] <supergino> hi fly
[18:59] <supergino>  do u fl
[18:59] <supergino> y?
[19:01] <sbivol> tsimpson: I'm not sure... the process is called „/usr/bin/quassel”
[19:02] <tsimpson> sbivol: then that the monolithic client, which is the quassel client and core in one. it's the same as any other IRC client in that once it's disconnected it has no way of receiving messages from the IRC server
[19:05] <sbivol> tsimpson: I understand that it can't receive messages while disconnected :) I'd like to find out whether it's possible to tell the server „give me the last X messages from this room”
[19:06] <tsimpson> no, that's not possible with IRC
[19:06] <tsimpson> once a message is sent it's gone
[19:06] <tsimpson> that's why people use "bouncers", which are constantly connected to the network
[19:06] <tsimpson> then you get the log from the bouncer when you connect to it
[19:07] <tsimpson> that's how the quassel-core/client part work, but you'd need a computer constantly connected to the network for it to work
[19:07] <sbivol> tsimpson: thank you very much! It's all clear now
[19:07] <tsimpson> no problem
[19:28] <tangent3> hi, for some reason when i copy files the progress bar is now displayed in a new dolphin window instead of system tray notification, i seem to have lost the systray notification thing. any idea how i can reenable that?
[19:29] <sbivol> tangent3: unlock widgets, right-clic the panel -> Add widgets. find System Tray in the list
[19:32] <tangent3> i do have the systray
[19:48] <sbivol> tankdriver: doesn't a logout/login help?
[19:48] <sbivol> sorry, I meant tangent3 :)
[19:49] <BluesKaj> sb he's long gone
[19:49] <BluesKaj> sbivol,^
[19:50] <sbivol> BluesKaj: I had the Quit events hidden
[19:51] <BluesKaj> he needs the notification widget
[19:52] <sbivol> BluesKaj: you mean he needs to turn on notifications from the System Tray widget?
[19:52] <BluesKaj> yup
[19:54] <BluesKaj> needs to turn the notfier on in the edit settings
[19:57] <zacarias> where are the installed desktop background images stored?
[19:59] <BluesKaj> zacarias, the defaults are in Desktop settings , just right click on the desktop , and it's at the bottom of the dialog
[20:00] <sbivol> zacarias: the .png files are at /usr/share/wallpapers
[20:01] <zacarias> sbivol: thanks
