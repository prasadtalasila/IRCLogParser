[04:31] <ScottK> xnox: We can put it in python3-pyqt4.  As long as the .so file is ABI tagged, it should be recognized by python3 before the python one.
[04:31] <ScottK> xnox: I did similar with kpythonpluginfactory in pydke4.

[07:39] <shadeslayer> *hi
[08:30] <shadeslayer> ScottK: what do you suggest we do about amarok stuck in -proposed?
[08:30] <shadeslayer> it failed to build on arm
[08:34] <shadeslayer> due to popular demand I'm going to try and build KDE 4.10 on Precise
[08:34] <shadeslayer> will just put everything in ninjas and see if that works

[09:02] <yofel> shadeslayer: if you do, at least write some backport rules for boost, otherwise it's A LOT of work - and don't backport pykde
[09:10] <shadeslayer> good point
[09:18] <shadeslayer> yofel: do you think this will be enough http://paste.kde.org/639338/
[09:20] <yofel> no, you'll need that, but there's a few boost-python deps and other stuff too
[09:21] <yofel> we also used 1.46 in precise so far, not sure if we should keep that or go with 1.48
[09:25]  * yofel wonders what else needs to be changed
[09:26] <yofel> at least one package needs libtiff4, a few need the symbol files deleted and you'll need kgapi and kolab from backports
[09:30]  * yofel realizes that the script doesn't really support backporting different kde releases to one series
[09:30] <yofel> not that it matters much now as we're done with 4.9
[09:30] <Riddell> shadeslayer: who's demanding it?
[09:31] <yofel> users, I got some requests too but was reluctant about it as it's a bit of a support mess
[09:32] <Riddell> ah, users, we'd have an easy time if it wasn't for them
[09:32] <Riddell> :)
[09:32] <yofel> true, but that would be boring :P
[09:34] <shadeslayer> ^
[09:35] <shadeslayer> hmm .. why do we want to delete the symbols files?
[09:35] <yofel> precise has gcc 4.6, so you'll get missing symbols
[09:35] <yofel> and a few packages fail on that
[09:36] <yofel> feel free to fix that differently, but it also causes them to be red on the status page from something we don't care about
[09:39] <shadeslayer> how about I just change boost for now and then we work out symbols and the boost stuff we missed in the PPA?
[09:40] <yofel> go ahead, just please write rules for them as you fix those so we don't have to do that again for RC3
[09:40] <shadeslayer> and I'm building with 1.48
[09:40] <shadeslayer> right
[10:05] <shadeslayer> any ideas how binary:Version is computed?

[10:42] <Riddell> shadeslayer, ScottK: I'll take a look at amarok
[10:42] <shadeslayer> \o/
[10:45] <shadeslayer> Riddell: oh and we also need a way to ship nepomuk with ffmpeg
[10:46] <shadeslayer> one way is to split the plugin into a package that does not get shipped on the CD
[10:48] <Riddell> shadeslayer: yep
[10:48] <shadeslayer> another is via dlrestrictions
[10:48] <Riddell> but I also need to tackle me 1852 unprocessed e-mails that have built up over the new year :)
[10:48] <shadeslayer> No idea how that works and JontheEchidna hasn't replied yet

[11:53] <Riddell> what is PAE?
[11:54] <yofel> in kernel meaning physical address extension
[11:54] <Riddell> as in http://paste.kde.org/639488/
[11:54] <yofel> ah yeah, we don't have any non-PAE kernels anymore
[11:54] <yofel> (IIRC)
[12:02] <Riddell> hmm, not quite sure how to reply to that without essentially saying "sorry tough luck"
[12:03] <xnox> Riddell: install precise, or whatever last non-pae supported release is.
[12:05] <Riddell> ok that'll do for an answer, thanks
[12:15] <yofel> shadeslayer: your backport attempt is missing kdegames from what I see. Did you use the 4.9 package list?
[12:16] <shadeslayer> hmm ....
[12:16] <shadeslayer> sec, my install is all broken after reboot
[12:16] <shadeslayer> no backlight control no hardware acceleration
[12:17] <shadeslayer> and now the electricity has gone, so I can only be here for a couple of minutes
[12:20] <shadeslayer> yofel: seems so, I guess the script used the kdesc-precise-backports.txt ?
[12:20] <shadeslayer> lemme fix
[12:20] <yofel> yeah, I didn't take stable-1 backports into account when writing this
[12:20] <shadeslayer> :P
[12:21] <shadeslayer> hey, precise is still stable :P
[12:21] <yofel> argh, you know what I mean ;P

[12:22] <yofel> I'm at work, so not for a few hours
[12:24] <shadeslayer> k, I'll try
[12:34] <shadeslayer> good thing I didn't delete the upload dir
[12:48] <afiestas> is there anyway of getting the patches from: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=10;filename=vbox-kcompat-3.6-3.7.patch;att=1;bug=696011
[12:49] <afiestas> and applying them to the dkms?
[12:49] <afiestas> I need to use virtualbox on the kernel I'm using (which comes from a ppa)
[12:49] <Mamarok> claydoh: JFYI: I put the posts to that topic on hold now, they should just shut up

[14:14] <yofel> seen
[14:14] <shadeslayer> "Error multiple versions of the same package" ?
[14:15] <yofel> lp sends data the script can't handle
[14:15] <yofel> not sure what though
[14:16] <Quintasan> good news
[14:16] <shadeslayer> everyone
[14:16] <yofel> I added the package name to the error, let's see
[14:16] <shadeslayer> okay
[14:17] <Quintasan> ScottK, Riddell: turns out installing anthy ins jp_JP locale did the ibus configuration magic itself
[14:18] <Quintasan> Therfore ScottK's proposed solution of making each langpack depend on ibus is the best solution imo
[14:18] <Quintasan> I would even go a step ahead and pull the module for ex. ibus-pinyin for chinese langpack
[14:19]  * yofel notes that lp feels esp. slow today
[14:20] <Riddell> Quintasan: good good
[14:20] <Riddell> do you know how to edit the langpacks?
[14:20] <Quintasan> Riddell: Absolutely no idea.
[14:21] <shadeslayer> yofel: today? hah, it's been like that for the last couple of days for me
[14:21] <yofel> didn't notice anything there, but usually the script runs for ~1min, now it's ~4
[14:22] <yofel> ok, no error this time
[14:23] <shadeslayer> I uploaded kdegames btw
[14:23] <yofel> good, I uploaded backend stuff (soprano, aknoadi, kgapi, cmake, attica, ...)
[14:24] <shadeslayer> awesome
[14:25] <yofel> oh, rekonq 2.0 is out
[14:25] <Riddell> whee!
[14:25] <Quintasan> Riddell: Aron Xu told me he will be trying to bring over the change from ibus to fctix in Ubuntu, he is one of most active members in Debian's pkg-ime
[14:26] <Riddell> I want to know why input methods needs all this faffy setup, why isn't it just a config value that can be controlled by a GUI?
[14:28] <Quintasan> Riddell: it seems ibus doesnt automatically enable input methods for certain languages unless your locale is that certain language
[14:28] <Quintasan> i.e. when you run jp_JP.UTF8 locale installing ibus-anthy will do the magic itself
[14:28] <Riddell> yeah, nuts
[14:29] <Quintasan> but when you use for eg. pl_PL.UTF8 installing ibus-anthy will just pull all the required stuff but not configure ibus to use the Anthy input method
[14:29] <shadeslayer> wheee http://www.zdnet.com/amazons-top-selling-laptop-doesnt-run-windows-or-mac-os-it-runs-linux-7000009433/
[14:29] <Riddell> nuts
[14:29] <Quintasan> so to fix it I just need to modify langpacks deps
[14:30] <Quintasan> But I'm still interested in making the change to fctix
[14:31] <Quintasan> it has Qt4 module
[14:31] <Quintasan> there is  input-method panel plasmoid
[14:31] <Quintasan> plus KCM
[14:31] <shadeslayer> fun
[14:31] <shadeslayer> cups is broken http://paste.kde.org/639692/
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[14:32] <Quintasan> Riddell: The only drawback I see is lack of Japanese input module
[14:33] <Riddell> Quintasan: no japanese with fctix? that seems like a big drawback no?
[14:33] <Quintasan> Yeah, but since it's modular it seems like it's only a matter of time
[14:34] <Quintasan> I will try contacting appropriate people and see how is that going to work
[14:34] <yofel> shadeslayer: reading the changelog entry for that I wonder what "Ubuntu for Android" is... and OS for an OS o.O?
[14:34] <shadeslayer> ah
[14:34] <shadeslayer> it's basically that :P
[14:34] <yofel> "fun"
[14:34] <shadeslayer> you can run Ubuntu ontop of Android

[14:56] <shadeslayer> heh true
[14:56] <shadeslayer> I wonder why it depends on the lib though

[14:57] <yofel> no comment
[14:57] <shadeslayer> wat
[14:58] <shadeslayer> yofel: seems fixed in 1.49

[14:58] <yofel> \o/
[14:59] <shadeslayer> now the tricky part
[15:00] <yofel> from what I see, okular needs a rule for tiff
[15:00] <shadeslayer> if we drop it, it might cause an issue in precise
[15:00] <yofel> and someone needs to backport indi
[15:00] <yofel> shadeslayer: if that's the case  just add a rule to add it back
[15:02] <yofel> shadeslayer: errr, you were looking at the deps of libboost-thread1.49-dev

[15:02] <yofel> Recommends: libboost-graph1.49.0 (= 1.49.0-3.1ubuntu1.1)
[15:02] <shadeslayer> derp
[15:02] <shadeslayer> wel
[15:02] <shadeslayer> better than suggests :P
[15:02] <yofel> true, but IIRC sbuild installs with --no-install-recommends

[15:35] <yofel> does print-manager intentionally have a not-versioned build-dep on kdelibs?
[15:36] <yofel> since it built I guess it doesn't matter, but it built with kdelibs 4.8 now
