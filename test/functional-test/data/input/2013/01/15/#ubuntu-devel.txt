[10:56] <ev> mpt: why is silent error types just restricted to errors that occur during logout/shutdown? Shouldn't all internal errors be hidden behind the "report previous internal errors" checkbox too? (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ErrorTracker#error)
[11:18] <mpt> ev, it isn't, that's just the kind we'd been definitive about so far. That's why it's a bulleted list. :-)
[11:18] <ev> ah, right
[11:19] <ev> so can I add non-desktop applications to that list?
[11:19] <mpt> Which ones?
[11:19] <mpt> If pulseaudio crashes, for example, that's an internal error that's going to be obvious to the user.
[11:19] <mpt> Or network-manager.
[11:20] <mpt> (Assuming that they were using sound or networking at the time.)
[11:20] <ev> hm, yeah
[11:21] <ev> if we were getting so precise as to separate out those cases, would it not also make sense to give them special wording?
[11:21] <ev> so, "sorry but your ability to hear sound may be hindered" rather than "an internal application crashed"
[11:21] <ev> something to that effect
[11:22] <ev> I guess I'm just worried that sometimes they'll see "an internal error occurred" and sometimes they wont, and it wont be clear why that's the case

[11:30] <mpt> ev, perhaps we could go through the leaderboard and sort the non-application packages into those two categories

[13:26] <didrocks> hey cjwatson, infinity: jibel told me that libbamf3-1 was in universe? I don't really understand what happened: I promoted it to main (from proposed) Friday, just after the copy happened for the daily release.
[13:27] <didrocks> cjwatson: infinity: I think that's why britney migrated it (once we rebuilt the rdepends because of the soname change) to the main pocket
[13:27] <didrocks> but then, in main, it was back in universe?
[13:27] <didrocks> s/in main/ in the release pocket/
[13:29] <xnox> didrocks: there is a bug where packages fall back into universe, after they are copied from -proposed to -release pocket.
[13:30] <xnox> =/ so most things need to be promoted twice.
[13:30] <didrocks> xnox: ah, so not related to the daily release at all. For future, it's the case everytime? So we need to repromote after the copy?
[13:30] <didrocks> ok, got it, good to know :)
[13:30] <didrocks> thanks xnox

[14:42] <roaksoax> howdy! I was wondering if anyone know if it is possible to determine is package A is to be installed (or has been installed) in package B postinst script?
[14:42] <pitti> roaksoax: you cannot install packages from postinst scripts, as apt/dpkg are not recursive
[14:42] <pitti> (the first will lock the dpkg db)
[14:43] <roaksoax> pitti: yeah I don't want to install a package I just want to determine whether another package has been installed or is to be installed (and if that's even possible)
[14:43] <pitti> roaksoax: oh sorry, you mean if it already is installed? dpkg -s pkgname >/dev/null 2>&1
[14:43] <pitti> "about to be installed" would be looking into the future
[14:44] <pitti> you can check whether it's unpacked, but not configured yet by looking at the "Status:" line
[14:44] <roaksoax> pitti: right let's say I do: sudo apt-get install meta-package which installs package A and B. Package B gets installed first but I want to know whether A is to be installed or not
[14:44] <pitti> but apt doesn't unpack everything before it starts configuring, it does that stuff in batches
[14:44] <pitti> roaksoax: not sure what you want to do, but that's usually the kind of stuff triggers are for
[14:45] <pitti> so that an already installed package can do stuff when another package gets installed later on
[14:45] <roaksoax> pitti: alright cool! I;ll look into triggers. Thanks for the info :)
[14:45] <pitti> roaksoax: "man deb-triggers" FYI
[14:45] <roaksoax> thanks :)
[14:48] <tumbleweed> checking whether it's unpacked (instead of using triggers) just sounds like a recipe for non-deterministic behavior

[19:52] <dkessel> hello guys. i have a question: under which circumstances does the bluetooth indicator icon get added to the indicator bar?
[19:52] <dkessel> i am asking because i seem to have a false positive...
[19:55] <roadmr> cyphermox probably knows :)
[20:02] <cyphermox> dkessel: if there is a bluetooth type device
[20:02] <cyphermox> dkessel: it kind of surprises me; maybe you have a device somewhere that says it does bluetooth even if it doesn't
[20:02] <cyphermox> or if you're using some of those logitech dongles for mice and keyboards
[20:03] <dkessel> cyphermox, i have a dell netbook. they sell the bluetooth module as an addon. but i don't have it. but i guess that explains it somehow...
[20:03] <sarnold> does it work anyway? :)
[20:03] <cyphermox> no, you should actually have a bluetooth device for the indicator to show up ;)
[20:04] <dkessel> tbh i tried to use it :)
[20:04] <dkessel> but as i don't have the module.... nothing
[20:04] <cyphermox> dkessel: what does hciconfig return?
[20:04] <dkessel> cyphermox, nothing
[20:04] <cyphermox> O.o?
[20:05] <dkessel> do i need some parameters?
[20:05] <cyphermox> going to have to look at the code
[20:05] <cyphermox> no
[20:05] <dkessel> :)
[20:05] <cyphermox> if there is a device it should be listed there
[20:05] <dkessel> funny
[20:06] <sarnold> I have to click the indicator and "turn on bluetooth" to get output from hciconfig on my machine..
[20:06] <infinity> Ditto.
[20:06] <infinity> Something's smart enough to know I have bluetooth, despite it being currently disabled/disconnected/whatever.
[20:07] <infinity> In fact, I can't even enable it from the indicator, cause it's hard-disabled by the machine.
[20:07] <dkessel> even if i do that, there's no output from hciconfig
[20:07] <roadmr> infinity: maybe something's dumb enough to assume you do; the smarts to know the device has to be enabled are yours :P
[20:07] <infinity> (But I still have the greyed-out indicator, until I undo my hardware rfkill)
[20:07] <slangasek> dkessel: what does 'rfkill list bluetooth' show?
[20:07] <roadmr> dkessel: udevadm info --export-db  |grep -i blue, does that say anything? (this is how checkbox looks for bluetooth so I'm guessing no, but may be interesting)
[20:09] <dkessel> slangasek, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1535302
=== salem_ is now known as _salem
[20:10] <stgraber> dkessel: can you paste the output of "dmesg"?
[20:11] <dkessel> roadmr, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1535311
[20:12] <roadmr> dkessel: thanks! so it looks like rfkill may be used to decide whether to display the indicator?
[20:13] <dkessel> stgraber, dmesg: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1535314
[20:14] <slangasek> roadmr: well, I think the indicator is displayed based on the presence of the underlying features that rfkill is also exposing
[20:14] <stgraber> thanks. So yeah, it looks like the applet is showing up when either you have a bluetooth device or the rfkill driver reports that you have one that can be turned on
[20:14] <roadmr> slangasek: well put, thanks :)
[20:15] <stgraber> not sure exactly how rfkill works, but I suspect it's getting the information from the firmware somehow (ACPI?) and that something's wrong somewhere in there
[20:15] <slangasek> dkessel: what's the output of 'ls -ld /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill3/device'?
[20:16] <dkessel> that takes a bit longer to type :) sec
[20:17] <dkessel> lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 15 21:16 /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill3/device -> ../../../compal-laptop
[20:17] <slangasek> mmk
=== _salem is now known as salem_
[20:18] <slangasek> so either the hardware claims to have a bluetooth interface, or the compal-laptop module has a bug
[20:19] <stgraber> dkessel: sorry, those are long paths. "cat /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill3/device/device/vendor" and "/sys/class/rfkill/rfkill3/device/device/device"
[20:19] <dkessel> :D
[20:20] <dkessel> i just found a new use case for ubuntu one... :)
[20:20] <stgraber> the first one should give you the hardware vendor id, the second one should give you the hardware product id
[20:20]  * dkessel pastes command lines
[20:20] <stgraber> oh, and I forgot cat in front of the second one, but you probably notice that ;)
[20:21] <dkessel> stgraber, file not found on first "vendor"
[20:22] <dkessel> stgraber, ...and another file not found on "device"
[20:23] <dkessel> shall i paste the contents of /sys/class/rfkill?
[20:23] <stgraber> ok, so based on what I'm seeing here, that'd mean that the driver isn't tied to a physical device (as /device/device should have pointed to the PCI or USB device)
[20:25] <stgraber> looks like a kernel bug to me... the compal-laptop driver always reports two rfkill entries even if the hardware isn't there
[20:26] <stgraber> I just tried it on my laptop with "modprobe compal-laptop force" (the force keyword is to bypass the DMI check) and I got two extra rfkill entries
[20:27] <dkessel> i would probably need help on how to properly file that bug
[20:27] <stgraber> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1535349/
[20:28] <stgraber> dkessel: do "ubuntu-bug linux" on your machine, once you have the bug filed on Launchpad give me the bug number and I'll see if there's something that should be added
[20:29] <dkessel> stgraber, will do
[20:31] <dkessel> hmm... "it appears you are currently running a mainline kernel".... meh - apport won't let me report... i'm running raring
[20:31] <stgraber> dkessel: fun... then go directly to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+filebug
[20:32] <stgraber> dkessel: and once the bug is filed, do "apport-collect <bug number>", that one should work without complaining too much
[20:35] <dkessel> launchpadlib would be part of ubuntu-dev-tools, i guess....
