[04:59] <ScottK> 4.9.4 released to -updates
[08:03] <soee> good morning
[09:40] <oy> which package is needed for kde.mk ?
[09:44] <oy> looks like pkg-kde-tools
[09:58] <Riddell> ScottK: yay thanks
[09:58] <Riddell> allee: you don't need reviewboard for that, just ask me or someone else with commit access
[11:11] <allee> Riddell: I should still have commit access.  But I prefer to get an okay.
[11:11] <Riddell> allee: it's just adding a licence file that should have been added in the first place
[11:12] <allee> Riddell: I've sent a lic/copyright fix e-mail to afiestas but it looks like it got lost
[11:12] <Riddell> really waiting for an ok is just unnecessary beurocracy
[11:12] <allee> Riddell: okay.  so I commit tonight

[17:16]  * Riddell jumps on calligra RC
[19:36] <allee> afiestas: have you 2-3 sentences (or more) that describe what libkscreen does (for the deb pkg description)
[19:36] <allee> describing kscreen is much easier because it has user visible stuff
[19:38] <Riddell> allee: usual practice is to copy & paste what kscreen does and add a paragraph just saying "this library provides common functions"
[19:40] <allee> Riddell: I know, but in this I can ask the expert ;-)  (personally I don't like the usual practise but I can understand why it's usually done) 
[19:41] <jessie> allee: Oh my! You are packaging kscreen?
[19:41] <allee> jessie: yes, it's in bzr already
[19:42] <jessie> WTF is bzr?
[19:42] <yofel> !bzr
[19:42] <ubottu> bzr is Bazaar-NG, a decentralized revision control system designed to be easy for developers and end users alike. Decentralized revision control systems give people the ability to work over the internet using the bazaar development model.  See http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.dev/en/mini-tutorial/ for a quickstart guide.
[19:43] <allee> jessie: kubuntu/experimental has even a libkscreen pkgs.  Yofel had no time yet to upload kscreen
[19:43] <yofel> ah yeah, I'll do it now
[19:43] <allee> hi yofel :-)
[19:43] <allee> thx
[19:43] <jessie> I've never heard of bzr before.
[19:44] <allee> jessie: :-)   kubuntu manages their pkging via bzr repositories.  This 'bzr' is here: https://code.launchpad.net/~kubuntu-packagers/kubuntu-packaging
[19:46] <jessie> I had no idea. Interesting. Advantages of bzr over git?
[19:46] <allee> jessie: ease of use!
[19:47] <jessie> Interesting. I may have to look into bzr now.
[20:25] <ejat>  trying to overwrite '/usr/share/kde4/services/kded/ktouchpadenabler.desktop', which is also in package kde-workspace-bin 4:4.9.97-0ubuntu3
[20:25] <Riddell> ejat: hmm
[20:26] <ejat> opss .. 
[20:28] <ejat> any log or anything that i may help triage that 
[20:29] <Riddell> nah it'll be easy enough to look at the packaging and fix
[20:29] <Riddell> it's a change I made earlier today
[20:29] <ejat> owh okie
[20:30] <ejat> tx .. btw .. did you know someone working on Xorg driver? 
[20:31] <Riddell> #ubuntu-x ?
[20:31] <ejat> owh tx 
[20:33] <yofel> allee: kscreen up
[20:35] <ejat> Riddell: should i file a bug for the above error?
[20:35] <Riddell> nah I'll got onto it

[22:38] <shadeslayer> Riddell: re poke armhf builds on kubuntu PPA
[22:38] <shadeslayer> yay/nay ?
[22:38] <shadeslayer> erm
[22:38] <shadeslayer> kubuntu active PPA
[22:42] <Riddell> mm what's the question?
[22:43] <Riddell> do we have the option?
[22:59] <yofel> shadeslayer: well, for that it makes sense IMHO
[23:00] <shadeslayer> Riddell: uh yes https://dev.launchpad.net/CommunityARMBuilds
[23:01] <shadeslayer> yofel: oh and btw, I was also thinking of doing daily builds for PA
[23:01] <Riddell> shadeslayer: sure, go for it
[23:01] <yofel> shadeslayer: I abandoned the p-m builds we had in neon, so feel free to
[23:02] <shadeslayer> yeah, I was thinking more along the lines of daily builds that one could install on the N7
[23:02] <yofel> didn't we only get 10 builds per week?
[23:03] <shadeslayer> sure, we could ask the admins to limit our daily builds
[23:03] <shadeslayer> and we could call them weekly builds or sth
[23:03] <yofel> hm, that would work I guess
[23:03]  * Riddell still reads PA as Pulseaudio
[23:04]  * yofel uses PA for both, so please watch the context :P

[23:14] <yofel> true :S
[23:18] <shadeslayer> so ... we'll have to refrain from uploading -workspace and kdelisb
