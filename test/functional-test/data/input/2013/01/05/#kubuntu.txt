[00:00] <RaphaelBarros> But I have some problems with it: when I set to Blender (which is my main program for my work) to stay on the dockand close the program afterwards, there's a space there with no icon, and when I click on it, this error appears: "KDEInit could not launch '/home/thebigheadedone/Blender 2.64 - Test Build/blender'"
[00:01] <RaphaelBarros> (which is strange, since my Blender folder is /Blender 2.65a)
[00:02] <sithlord48> you do not have system installed blender?
[00:02] <RaphaelBarros> Nope, I use the extracted version from their site
[00:02] <RaphaelBarros> Do I need to install it from the Software Center or a ppa?
[00:03] <sithlord48> not really but you may need a menu entry for it to show correctly
[00:14] <RaphaelBarros> I have one menu entry for it :/, when I open directly from a .desktop from my desktop, the icon that appears on the panel is a X, not the blender icon, and when I open from the menu entry, the same X appears and another space with the blender icon and a "loading" like effect, if set it to stay on the taskbar, the same error happens.
[00:16] <RaphaelBarros> So sad there has been no update to this widget since nov 10 2011.
[01:17] <claptrap> Anyone know of app that can view HTML and let you add notes or bookmarks? Like .pdf files.
[01:18] <claptrap> I could manually put in #tags but that would be tiresome for a technical document of ~150pages.

[05:54] <bjrohan> HELP! I ran the fork bomb (I thought I had my processes limited correctly, but I did not). Soo, I rebooted, and now for some reason I can not open webpages in Chromium, or Chrome, but I can in FireFox. Also, I can not get system settings to open
[05:55] <bjrohan> I think the problem is that I have my settings set to restart anything I had runnin when I reboot

[06:58] <Syria> Hi there! When I click on a link in the email client, I get a message telling me that I have to choose which program do I have to use to open that link!
[06:59] <Syria> Also When I download anything using firefox and I double click on it, I get the same message!
[07:20] <KimLaroux> Syria: which email client?
[07:22] <Syria> KimLaroux: Mozilla Thunderbird, Also The browser is causing the same problem, and any downloading program, When I click on the downloaded file, An image for example, I get a message telling me that I have to choose an application.
[07:22] <KimLaroux> did you chose an application?
[07:23] <KimLaroux> it should save it and never ask again
[07:23] <KimLaroux> but the first time it does ask
[07:34] <Syria> KimLaroux: I did not face this with the older releases, Also I don't know how to choose which application because when i click on the button "Choose" I get a normal file browser only.
[07:35] <KimLaroux> yeah, you have to find the binary
[07:35] <KimLaroux> it should be in /usr/bin
[07:35] <KimLaroux> just click on whichever, then select
[07:36] <KimLaroux> I installed Kubuntu 12.10 last week and I had the same thing
[07:36] <Syria> KimLaroux: Okay I will search for the binary in /usr/bin
[07:38] <Syria> KimLaroux:  It worked,
[07:38] <Syria> KimLaroux:  Thank you.
[07:38] <KimLaroux> you're welcome =)

[13:28] <Syria> Hi, How can I poweroff several machines at one time? When the employees go home somethimes they forget their computers running!
[13:35] <ludvika> login
[13:36] <monkeyjuice> Syria: why shut them down?
[13:37] <Syria> monkeyjuice:  Because in Syria the electricity is very bad and we have no ups devices attached to the computers, So when they leave their offices sometimes they forget the computers running.
[13:38] <monkeyjuice> your system admin?
[13:38] <Syria> monkeyjuice:  Yes.
[13:38] <monkeyjuice> hmmm guess you could just ssh in to them from your desk and do  a shutdown
[13:39] <monkeyjuice> before you leave
[13:39] <monkeyjuice> or write a script set to time out
[13:39] <Syria> monkeyjuice:  I thought about that, But it is not an easy thing for 35 computers.
[13:39] <monkeyjuice> hmmm
[13:39] <monkeyjuice> they all leave at the same time every day
[13:40] <sbivol_> Syria: The best approach is for you to set a cron task that runs at a late hour, say if employees leave at 18:00, you set a task that does „shutdown now” and runs at 18:30
[13:41] <sbivol_> Syria: a nice application that I use on my computer is KShutdown. It is very flexible.
[13:49] <sbivol_> Syria: regarding the email link and Firefox, it's an issue because of the poor integration that Gnome applications have with other desktop environments. this link may help you: http://matthieu.yiptong.ca/2012/04/12/fix-file-open-and-open-containing-folder-on-kdekubuntu-12-04/

Is there a safe tool to clean up the /boot partition since i dont have a clue on what to do my self?

[17:20] <The_Jag> hi all
[17:21] <The_Jag> I need a little help with Dolphin, my NAS and digikam
[17:21] <The_Jag> anyone willing to help?
[17:21] <The_Jag> I have the need to mount some folders on my NAS onto my system
[17:24] <DarthFrog> The_Jag:  Set up a NFS server on the NAS and mount the NFS shares into your filesystem.
[17:24] <The_Jag> :DarthFrog
[17:24] <DarthFrog> Or, if the NAS exports Windows shares, use Samba to mount them.
[17:25] <The_Jag> DarthFrog: I already do that but on dolphin it shows the folders as Network Resources, not as Devices
[17:25] <The_Jag> so, when setting the folder to store photos in digikam, It cannot recognize the nas folder
[17:25] <DarthFrog> The_Jag:  Likely Dolphin isn't reporting the mounted directories, it's likely doing uPNP.
[17:26] <The_Jag> I added the folder using the wizard in dolphin, ssh connection
[17:26] <DarthFrog> Can you get to the NFS mounted directory via the command line?
[17:26] <The_Jag> even connecting through samba did not work for digikam
[17:27] <The_Jag> uhm
[17:27] <The_Jag> how to do that?
[17:27] <The_Jag> sorry not that capable of using command line
[17:27] <The_Jag> moving first steps
[17:28] <DarthFrog> The_Jag: Hmm, sorry.
[17:28] <The_Jag> no prob
[17:28] <The_Jag> thanks
[17:29] <DarthFrog> How are you browsing to the shares in Dolphin?  By clicking on the "Network" icon?
[17:29] <DarthFrog> Can you browse to the mounted shares by clicking on the "Root" icon?
[17:29] <The_Jag> let me see
[17:30] <The_Jag> to access the folder
[17:30] <The_Jag> I have to go through Network in the Resources left panel
[17:30] <The_Jag> not root
[17:31] <DarthFrog> Yeah, that's not mounting the remote directory into your file system.
[17:31] <The_Jag> exactly
[17:31] <The_Jag> I reach it through ssh (via Dolphin)
[17:31] <The_Jag> I'd like to see the folder as mounted like an harddrive
[17:32] <The_Jag> like in Windows, OSX or even Gnome Nautilus
[17:32] <The_Jag> without using fstab
[17:33] <The_Jag> I mean, I'd like to click on my NAS icon in Dolphin and then it mounts the device
[17:33] <The_Jag> in old ubuntu I could do that
[17:33] <The_Jag> in kubuntu and Dolphin I can't find the way
[17:34] <DarthFrog> I've never done it.  Never had to.  Sorry.
[17:34] <The_Jag> Oh ok, no problem then! Thanks for the help!
[17:34] <DarthFrog> But I could see how that capability would be incredibly useful.
[17:35] <DarthFrog> I'm not saying it can't be done, BTW.  I'm saying I've never tried to do so. :-)
[17:35] <The_Jag> yes it is!
[17:35] <The_Jag> :)
[17:36] <The_Jag> BTW what's NFS?
[17:36] <DarthFrog> Network File System.   It's exactly what you want.  But it's not trivial.
[17:36] <The_Jag> Ah
[17:36] <The_Jag> ok
[17:36] <The_Jag> Ijust enabled it from the nas control panel let's see what will happen
[17:37] <DarthFrog> If your NAS device has a NFS server, you'll be away to the races.
[17:38] <The_Jag> should I see it from root?
[17:38] <DarthFrog> Not until it's properly configured.
[17:38] <DarthFrog> You will have to tell the NFS server which directories to export.
[17:39] <The_Jag> ok
[17:39] <DarthFrog> Then you'll have to mount those exports (shared directories) you want into your file system.
[17:40] <The_Jag> uhm
[17:40] <DarthFrog> Set the mounting up in fstab and it's there all the time .
[17:40] <The_Jag> now the thing is to set up the nas then
[17:40] <DarthFrog> I did say it wasn't trivial. :-)
[17:40] <The_Jag> :)
[17:40] <DarthFrog> Yes, set up the NAS to export the directories you want.
[17:42] <DarthFrog> Then confirm that it's been done properly by opening up a command line terminal (i.e konsole in KDE) by the following command "showmount -e <ip address of NAS device or name if it's resolveable>"
[17:42] <The_Jag> Dolphin is powerful but messy
[17:43] <The_Jag> but still i don't want to mount the nas always
[17:43] <The_Jag> I'd like to mount it when I want
[17:43] <DarthFrog> Then set the "noauto" switch in fstab.
[17:43] <The_Jag> let me see
[17:43] <The_Jag> oh
[17:43] <The_Jag> cool
[17:43] <The_Jag> :D
[17:43] <FloodBotK1> The_Jag: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[17:46] <DarthFrog> The_Jag:  Here's my fstab: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1500289/
[17:46] <The_Jag> thanks
[17:48] <DarthFrog> All the "nodev,noexec,nosuid" options are for security.
[17:49] <The_Jag> ok get it
[17:49] <The_Jag> still trying to set up the nas though :P
[17:49] <DarthFrog> Have fun. :-)
[17:49] <The_Jag> eheh thanks!
