[00:26] <Minsc> hello *.*
[00:27] <KJ_agent007> hi minsc
[00:29] <Minsc> i'm not sure how to configure my nvidia card with 2 monitors, should i use nvidia-settings or the monitor configuration in systemcontrol?
[00:35] <mandoguit> Minsc:  I use the nVidia Server Settings -> X Server Display configuration
[00:42] <KJ_agent007> what version of kubuntu are you using, mandog?
[00:45] <KJ_agent007> it seems to be a common problem when upgrading kubuntu 12.04 to 12.10
[00:49] <mandoguit> fwiw.... just did that upgrade yesterday and my original monitor settings were honored (laptop and desktop monitor)    Graphics:  Card: NVIDIA G96 [GeForce 9600M GT] X.Org: 1.13.0 driver: nvidia Resolution: 1280x1024@60.0hz, 1440x900@59.9hz
[00:49] <mandoguit>            GLX Renderer: GeForce 9600M GT/PCIe/SSE2 GLX Version: 3.3.0 NVIDIA 304.43      maybe newer cards are more prone to buglets?
[00:50] <KJ_agent007> possible but you might try backing things up and doing a clean 12.10 install
[00:50] <KJ_agent007> the upgrades sometimes break packages
[00:51] <KJ_agent007> in my case the muon package manager crapped out
[00:51] <mandoguit> KJ_agent007:    I am not the one having problems....as stated my upgrade went fine
[00:51] <KJ_agent007> alrighty
[00:53] <mandoguit> in fact it really suprised me with the ease of doing it.,    the only thing that really suprised me was the total amount of files (over 1 gigs worth) that had to be downloaded but from what I have seen/experienced so far it was worth it :)
[00:53] <KJ_agent007> awesome

[01:45] <MichaelP> what is the best site for plymouth boot screens ?
[01:58] <MichaelP> Whats a good site with good plymouth boot screens ?
[02:06] <MichaelP> Everyone sleeping
[02:15] <logicist> how can i upgrade to kernel 3.8?
[02:15] <logicist> from 3.5
[02:15] <logicist> must i compile it myself?
[02:16] <yofel> there are unsupported mainline deb packages on http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
[02:16] <yofel> you need the ones for your architecture and the "all" one.
[02:23] <MichaelP> Where is a good web site with plymouth boot screens ?
[02:25] <BluesKaj> MichaelP, try www.kubuntu.org
[02:27] <shadeslayer> I don't think kubuntu.org has plymouth boot screens
[02:27] <shadeslayer> but if you just google for them, you can find many of them
[02:28] <BluesKaj> maybe it'll have a link
[02:29] <MichaelP> BluesKaj, only a few on there.. And they suck
[02:31] <BluesKaj> well, linux teaches us patience after a while ...plymouth doesn't appear for very long anyway ..maybe in the near future a less dull and dreary plymouth will be created

[02:49] <logicist> anyone have a Intel Wireless-N 6150 + WiMAX card?
[02:49] <logicist> i'm not getting any errors, it just won't connect. keeps asking for the password after a few minutes of lingering.
[02:50]  * shadeslayer wants to get rid of the whole "Boot splash" paradigm
[02:50] <logicist> yet, with Intel PRO 4965, i'm here
[02:51] <shadeslayer> iirc the 4965 is a really old and really well supported card
[02:51] <shadeslayer> I think my XPS M1530 has that :D
[02:52] <shadeslayer> correction, my now dead XPS M1530
[02:53] <BluesKaj> well, getting close to bedtime for old guys ...later folks
[02:55] <shadeslayer> logicist: have you tried googling your wireless chipset number + ubuntu?
[02:55] <mandoguit> maybe make sure both are using same security protocols   wpa, wpa2 etc
[02:55] <shadeslayer> mandoguit: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/876147
[02:55] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 876147 in linux (Ubuntu) "Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N + WiMAX 6150 (rev 67) not working after upgrade to 11.10" [High,Triaged]
[02:55] <shadeslayer> erm
[02:55] <shadeslayer> logicist: ^
[02:56] <logicist> i tried that
[02:56] <logicist> yes, thank you.
[02:56] <shadeslayer> okay, people say comment 16 makes the wifi worl
[02:56] <shadeslayer> *work
[02:57] <shadeslayer> 2 channels where you might be able to find support, #linux-wireless and #ubuntu-kernel
[02:58] <logicist> thank you so much
[02:59] <shadeslayer> http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi says the 6150 should be supported
[03:00] <shadeslayer> anyway
[03:00] <shadeslayer> cya
[03:06] <logicist> it worked
[03:06] <logicist> thanks alot
[03:06] <logicist> i had tried that command before
[03:07] <logicist> sudo modprobe -r iwlagn
[03:07] <logicist> sudo modprobe iwlagn bt_coex_active=0
[03:07] <logicist> but it wasn't exactly the same last time, it WORKED this time

[10:47] <jjeronimo> pff list my s/pdif audio output capability :(
[10:47] <jjeronimo> lost*
[10:48] <jjeronimo> it happened after using a bluetooth audio device
[10:49] <jjeronimo> Audio output failed:
[10:49] <jjeronimo> The audio device "iec958:AES0=0x2,AES1=0x82,AES2=0x0,AES3=0x2" could not be used:
[10:49] <jjeronimo> No such file or directory.
[11:17] <jjeronimo> I'm using kubuntu but I can't get my s/pdif working, it used to work on ALSA, but I dind't use it in a while, stopped working because I added a bluetooth audio device?
[11:17] <jjeronimo> is s/pdif supposed to work or is the support here in it's early stages?
[11:25] <jjeronimo> I would pay to improve the s/pdif support :)
[11:26] <jjeronimo> to give back to the community :)
[11:39] <Peace-> jjeronimo: mmm could you remove the bluetooth ?

[13:24] <n8w> yofel: ye dd seems to b a way...besides, its already installed in the system, so np:)
[13:25] <yofel> well, you can't dd the system you're currently using, there's other applications for that, but then you'll usually just backup the files, not the filesystem and partition table
[13:25] <yofel> dd is there by default though, right

[19:28] <invariant> Progers, it's not perfect.
[19:28] <invariant> Progers, it's good enough for virtually all purposes, I'd say.

[19:49] <invariant> Progers, since it stopped sucking :)
[19:49] <Progers> And you dont use windows anymore?
[19:50] <invariant> Progers, not unless I have to for some devices for which no *nix applications exist.

[21:04] <jeramyeggs> Hello folks, i was wondering if any of you have any experience with wubi?
[21:07] <lordievader> jeramyeggs: Some, been years ago though. Didn't like it...
[21:08] <jeramyeggs> I am a complete newb when it comes to Linux, and grub scares the crap out of me. Is there a way to install kubuntu, and still maintain my MBR?
[21:09] <jeramyeggs> @lordievader Wubi is being a pain, and am wanting to learn how to use linux, just in a safe way.
[21:09] <lordievader> jeramyeggs: Perhaps creating a persistent Live-usb is a better idea. Wubi is a very termporary install, for the long run it is a pita.
[21:10] <Guest15488> what is your concern about grub?
[21:11] <lordievader> jeramyeggs: You can make one with Unetbootin

[21:14] <jeramyeggs> I haphazdly installed grub, and had fits trying to get rid of it. I share the laptop with my wife, and want to be able to boot into windows as the default. I have multiple laptops, but the one we share is the only one that allows me to decompile, or build roms in a timely manner. I have got the linux itch from android, and want to delve deeper.
[21:16] <lordievader> jeramyeggs: Grub can be configured to have Windows as the default.
[21:18] <jeramyeggs> How hard is it to configure grub to someone who knows very little commands
[21:18] <lordievader> jeramyeggs: If you install the grub-customizer program, not very. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10340183
[21:19] <Guest15488> yes MBR must be modified to install Kubuntu because MBR is what will let you boot into Kubuntu in the first place, but the grub is nothing to be feared. if you install kubuntu as a dual-boot the worst case scenario is your Kubuntu will be default and your wife or others will have to select Windows at startup, but that isn't hard. Or you can modify grub to have Windows as the default
[21:19] <Guest15488> there are guides if you search google
[21:21] <Guest15488> or look into "persistent live-USB", I forgot the exact details but it's not to hard to create. That's where you format a USB stick and put your entire OS/programs/files etc on a USB drive. You boot from it and the OS gets loaded into memory, and "persistent" means changes and files created while in the OS get saved back to the USB
[21:23] <lordievader> Guest15488: Unetbootin ;)
[21:23] <Guest15488> is there an option in Unetbootin to make a kubuntu persistent live-USB?
[21:24] <jeramyeggs> I have a 2.5 external hard drive that i could do this with, will it slow it down a lot from running from an external?
[21:24] <Guest15488> no not a lot... probably noticeable though
[21:25] <lordievader> Guest15488: Yes, there is a slider for how much space it may use for persistency. Though it claims this is only supported for Ubuntu.
[21:25] <Guest15488> external hd would be one way to avoid modifying the MBR on the drive with windows
[21:25] <Guest15488> haha cool, that's pretty neat
[21:26] <Guest15488> =)
[21:26] <lordievader> Guest15488: If you don't forget to write grub to the secondary drive...
=== dimitris is now known as Guest56341
[21:27] <Guest15488> yeah true
[21:27] <Guest15488> that's easy to forget if you're not paying attention
[21:29] <mandoguit> Guest11588:   one cavet with persistence.......persistence file can only be 4 gig in size maximum.   and afaik, persistence will not allow kernel updates
[21:30] <jeramyeggs> So if i install on my primary drive, and change the boot preference, it would be the best installation method, correct? I am in it for the long run, i just dont want to mess up my wifes files in the laptop. I have read horror stories of grub updating, and peoople having trouble getting back into windows, how common is this?
[21:30] <Guest15488> Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it as a long-term OS, but just because he wants to learn how to use Linux and play around with it
[21:31] <Guest15488> i never had that problem with grub, but yeah I heard occasional stories
[21:32] <lordievader> jeramyeggs: Allways make a backup, it has never happend to me that I could not acces Windows due to grub. But for you it might be a better idea to go with the persistent live-usb.
[21:32] <Guest15488> Kubuntu is pretty safe, just install it as dual-boot, then change grub boot order if you want, and when you do updates do it through the software center/update manager/etc
[21:33] <Guest15488> if you're really worried i would do the external HD idea... if anything goes wrong you can always just wipe that drive and start over
[21:35] <mandoguit> personally I don't bother with the persistent usbs.....just install as per normal treating the stick as a usb drive.   that way all upgrades, kernels etc can be implemented.   one thing about this method is it will apparently shorten the usb sticks life span due to the number of increased writes to the device.   fwiw, this however is not a factor for me as I mainly use usb sticks for emergancy operations
[21:37] <mandoguit> as for grub issues...........seen and encountered a fair share of grub related install issues over the years.   they can be fixed though.   as previously mentioned, backups are strongly recommended to original (ie windows etc) files needed to be preserved.
[21:37] <Guest15488> yeah you could just buy a 32gb USB drive for $20 and then install Kubuntu on there as a regular install.
[21:38] <jeramyeggs> I am just trying to wrap my head around all of this. I want to use it as a long term os, if i can get the display setting correct. I have tried mint, ubuntu, and kubuntu. I have never been able to get audio out to my Tv. I will prob try dual booting, changing the boot order, and if i still have problems with the audio out, come back in here, and bother you guys some more. I will redirect my wife to save to our external sata drive,
[21:38] <mandoguit> .... and usb sticks will be noticably slower in operation compared to hard drive installs
[21:41] <Guest15488> yeah audio is tricky, there are ways but you have to do your hw
[21:41] <Guest15488> my audio setup is very simple so i'm lucky

=== FabianB is now known as FabianBu
[21:43] <jeramyeggs> Thanks for your guys time, and help. I am going to give it a shot, and come back, and ask for help with the display/audio problems I have had. You guys gave me the confidence to try a dual boot install again.
[21:43] <Guest15488> if your move or make copies of all her files to the external HD and then have her create new files to it, i think in the worst nuclear meltdown scenario at least she'd still have all her data, but like i said Kubuntu is pretty safe.
[21:43] <Guest15488> good luck
[21:45] <jeramyeggs> One more quick question, should i use 12.10, 0r the 12.04? Do both have the same support level?
[21:46] <DarthFrog> jeramyeggs: No, they don't.  12.04 is a LTS release, has 5 years support.  12.10 only has 18 months support.
[21:46] <Guest15488> 12.04 will be supported for several years, use it if you just want to install the OS and be done with it for years
[21:46] <Guest15488> 12.10 you would probably update/replace in a year or two
[21:47] <jeramyeggs> thanks again.....
[21:47] <Guest15488> yeah what DarthFrog said
[21:47] <DarthFrog> 12.04 will be more stable.  Not that really is an issue.
[21:48] <DarthFrog> Valve specifically only supports Steam on 12.04.
[21:48] <Guest15488> has anyone on here tried Muon Discover btw
[21:48] <DarthFrog> If that's a consideration. :-)

[22:30] <Walzmyn> Is there a way to make KDE have a single, global menu bar the way OSX does?
[22:34] <kingjere> Walzmyn: It's interesting, because if you use the netbook workspace I think that is the default behavior, but I can't figure out how to make it like that with desktop workspace.
[22:34] <Walzmyn> kingjere: interesting.
[22:35] <yofel> there is a menubar widget that shows the menu bar
[22:35] <Walzmyn> I see the Mac fanbois all the rage about it. I looks kinda silly to me, but I want to give it a whirl before I really made fun of it
[22:35] <Walzmyn> yofel: where?
[22:36] <yofel> if you search for menu in the widget list it should show up
[22:36] <yofel> if not plasma-widget-menubar probably isn't installed
[22:37] <kingjere> yofel: that is kinda cool.
[22:37] <Walzmyn> ok, I found it. That is an intersting way to accomplish this
[22:37] <Walzmyn> thanks, yofel
[22:37] <kingjere> essentially useless for maximized windows though.
[22:38] <Walzmyn> of course, the other problem with giving this a good, honest try is I keep my task bar at the top, so now it's in the way...
[22:38] <Walzmyn> kingjere: yes it is
[22:40] <Walzmyn> trying to stick it on my panel has casued plasma to re-boot twice :(
[22:42] <kingjere> yikes.
[22:42] <yofel> now that's not good :/
[22:42] <yofel> did you at least get a crash notification or did it just restart?

[23:41] <jeramy> alright, does anyone want to help a newb with his install of kubuntu?
[23:53] <BarkingFish> evening. anyone know what to do when your OS thinks it knows better than you do? :P
[23:53] <BarkingFish> I want to install nmap's frontend, nmapfe - my system wants to install zenmap instead, which I don't want.
[23:54] <BarkingFish> it won't let me install nmapfe. What do i do to force it?  My computer does what I want it to do, not what it thinks is best for it :P
