[00:18] <shadeslayer> :S
[00:19] <shadeslayer> quassel has a huge diff
[00:20] <yofel> it does o.O?
[00:21] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/656684
[00:22] <shadeslayer> ignore the changelog bits ofcourse
[00:24] <yofel> wth, we *never* merged that so far it seems o.O
[00:24] <shadeslayer> O_O
[00:24] <shadeslayer> because we use compat 7 and what not maybe?
[00:25] <shadeslayer> even the copyright files are different xD
[00:37] <shadeslayer> there's stuff in the build-deps that makes no sense
[00:37] <shadeslayer> for eg. libnice-dev
[00:38] <shadeslayer> whereas from what I can tell by grepping, quassel does not use any of libnice's API
[00:38] <shadeslayer> ( this is in the debian package )
[00:40] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: Riddell http://csstardis.co.uk/
[00:49] <shadeslayer> yofel: pointless to merge this
[00:50] <yofel> ack
[00:51] <shadeslayer> my inbox is full of interesting threads
[00:51] <shadeslayer> "Has INTEL been taken over by m$ or is it a market-manipulation tie-up ??"
[00:51] <shadeslayer> "Ubuntu and derivatives (Re: Ubuntu.com Download Page)"
[00:55] <Darkwing> Do you know of a way to use Virt to boot up an install of windows that is dual booted within Linux?
[00:55] <Darkwing> So, I have a dual boot (Games and school) But, I want to multitask but still have access for my school stuff in windows. I can reinstall windows in a virtbox *Gags* but, I want to be able to boot my installed Windows within Linux.
[01:00] <shadeslayer> yofel: we have a problem
[01:01] <yofel> huh?
[01:01] <shadeslayer> I'm rebuilding libkolab and got this make[3]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/lib/libboost_system-mt.so', needed by `lib/libkolab.so.0.4.1'.  Stop.
[01:01] <yofel> needs libboost-system1.49-dev
[01:01] <shadeslayer> ah
[01:01] <shadeslayer> you added it
[01:01] <shadeslayer> I have the old on
[01:01] <shadeslayer> *one
[01:01] <yofel> that should *really* be a dep of libkolabxml-dev
[01:01] <yofel> but I'm too lazy
[01:01] <shadeslayer> xD
[01:03] <shadeslayer> yofel: the thing is, it worked fine
[01:03] <shadeslayer> the last time I tried it
[01:03] <yofel> it worked with old libkolabxml
[01:03] <yofel> the new one nees that ^
[01:03] <shadeslayer> I see
[01:03] <yofel> and I guess the cmake file implies that it's there later
[01:03] <yofel> s/implies/assumes/
[01:03] <kubotu> yofel meant: "and I guess the cmake file assumes that it's there later"
[02:46] <shadeslayer> yofel: so I got some stuff fixed upstream
[02:46] <shadeslayer> wrt kolab
[02:46] <shadeslayer> see http://git.kolab.org/libkolab/log/?h=libkolab-0.4
[02:46] <shadeslayer> however
[02:47] <shadeslayer> I seem to have hit some sort of bug in ctest 
[02:47] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/656726/
[02:47] <shadeslayer> where the build does not proceed even if the test fails
[02:47] <shadeslayer> see http://paste.ubuntu.com/1571583/

[10:21] <yofel_> shadeslayer: it seems like calendaringtest doesn't finish now... there's no result status for #4

[10:21] <yofel> good morning btw. ^^
[10:21] <shadeslayer> I think I know why
[10:22] <shadeslayer> <jmeeuwen> this is for Debian Wheezy, so we ship and build against libcalendaring
[10:22] <shadeslayer> <jmeeuwen> because there is no KDE 4.9 in Debian, as i'm sure you're well aware
[10:22] <shadeslayer> <jmeeuwen> so we provide the bare minimum of what we need from kde 4.9 through a library of our own called libcalendaring
[10:22] <shadeslayer> maybe calendaringtest needs libcalendaring ?
[10:22] <yofel> oh, fun
[10:25] <shadeslayer> I can't say for sure though
[10:27] <shadeslayer> could be another bug in ctest
[10:27] <shadeslayer> as for the test failing, I was told it seems like an UTF issue
[10:27] <shadeslayer> any ideas if we should export some var for UTF stuff?
[10:35] <yofel> no :/
[10:38] <shadeslayer> :)
[10:41] <shadeslayer> yofel: oh ... maybe calendaringtest is what's blocking
[10:42] <shadeslayer> maybe formattest fails properly, but the build is stuck waiting for calendaringtest to finish
[10:42] <shadeslayer> ( I was under the impression that formattest was blocking the build )
[10:43] <yofel> that's what I said...
[10:43] <yofel> the weird thing is that it passed before
[10:45] <shadeslayer> right
[10:45] <shadeslayer> I didn't notice that
[14:06] <BluesKaj> Howdy folks
[14:28] <afiestas> There are a bunch of complains about "kubuntu missing debug symbols" in reddit

[16:17] <apachelogger> did you talk to nuno?
[16:21] <apachelogger> afiestas: I probably fail at making drkonqi making sure they can be installed
[16:22] <apachelogger> what with it being a problem of continous bandwith and disk space use vs. insanely high bandwith and disk access when needed
