[07:33] <toabctl> how can I close a launchpad bug report with requestsync? Should I edit the changelog which is shown in a editor?
[07:40] <mitya57> toabctl: I think it's better to not touch the changelog if the package is in sync with Debian, and the person who is actually syncing may use syncpackage -b to close the bug

[09:07] <Esokrates_> I was trying to compile unity today, but I got the following output:
[09:07] <Esokrates_> http://ubuntuone.com/6hsVC0HWDdWT2ky9Sux0vE  (Cmake output)
[09:09] <Esokrates_> what i wrong with my zeigeist package?
[09:10] <mitya57_> Esokrates_: hm, is libzeitgeist-dev installed?
[09:13] <Esokrates_> no seems not to be installed, thanks I seemed to missed that
[09:14] <Esokrates_> I also thought of zeitgeist packages I have missed, and ineed installed a few additional, but I missed that one, I will install them and try to compile again, thanks
[09:15] <mitya57_> you could just use `sudo apt-get build-dep unity` :)
[09:17] <Esokrates_> thank you :-)
[09:40] <Esokrates> I got the following output while compiling unity:

[09:44] <Esokrates> mitya57, do you have an idea?
[09:54] <mitya57_> Esokrates: if that's unity from raring/lp:unity, it may need a newer nux
[09:54] <Esokrates> yeah it is
[09:55] <mitya57_> (I think the version was bumped, but maybe you are using a snapshot where it wasn't yet)
[09:55] <Esokrates> https://code.launchpad.net/~smspillaz/unity/unity.fix_1091600
[09:56] <Esokrates> I want to test a fix included there
[09:56] <Esokrates> this instruction did not work:
[09:56] <Esokrates> http://askubuntu.com/questions/28470/how-do-i-build-unity-from-source/28472#28472
[10:02] <mitya57_> If I were you, I would just grab the diff from https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~smspillaz/unity/unity.fix_1091600/diff/2999 and apply it to the quantal-proposed package
[10:05] <Esokrates> mitya57, could you link me an instrution how to do that? I have never done this
[10:07] <mitya57_> Esokrates: something like this (not tested):
[10:07] <mitya57_> dget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/unity_6.12.0-0ubuntu0.2.dsc
[10:08] <mitya57_> or, better (so that it would extract it):
[10:08] <mitya57_> DGET_VERIFY=no dget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/unity_6.12.0-0ubuntu0.2.dsc
[10:08] <mitya57_> cd unity-6.12.0-0ubuntu0.2
[10:09] <mitya57_> wget https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~smspillaz/unity/unity.fix_1091600/diff/2999 -O lp1091600.diff
[10:09] <mitya57_> patch -p0 lp1091600.diff
[10:09] <mitya57_> debuild -us -uc
[10:10] <mitya57_> (that's all)
[10:10] <tumbleweed> mitya57_: you may find pull-lp-source useful, in future
[10:10] <tumbleweed> presumably you meant patch -p0 < lp1091600.diff
[10:10] <mitya57_> of course
[10:11] <mitya57_> tumbleweed: thanks for suggestion :)
[11:00] <Esokrates> mitya57, I sucessfully compiled compiz and unity to my home directory
[11:01] <Esokrates> mitya57, but if I start compiz unity does not get loaded, I only see windows, no launcher no panel etc.
[11:01] <Esokrates> used the following in a VT: env DISPLAY=:0 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib ./bin/compiz --replace composite opengl move resize decor compiztoolbox mousepoll wall expo animation switcher
[11:03] <Esokrates> when I run unity, the old compiz gets started

[17:41] <code_6> hey I am new and I want to contribute to ubuntu can anyone help me with this ?
[17:44] <code_6> any one active here ?
[17:48] <penguin42> code_6: http://www.ubuntu.com/community/get-involved is a good start
[17:49] <code_6> i checked that out but what to do next they say you can get a mentor but nothing about how to find one
[17:50] <penguin42> was that under the bug stuff or elsewhere?
[17:51] <code_6> under the link you mentioned
[17:51] <mitya57> OdyX: impressive changelog, you people are heroes!
[17:57] <mitya57> code_6: if you want a mentor, just make sure your package shows in the sponsoring queue
[17:57] <mitya57> http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/sponsoring/
[17:58] <mitya57> it'll be shown there if you filed a merge proposal or subscribed ~ubuntu-sponsors to a bug
[17:58] <OdyX> mitya57: cups ?
[17:58] <mitya57> OdyX: yeah (and the number of patches is also impressive)
[17:58] <OdyX> mitya57: praise tkamppeter , but there was a huge job in making 1.6.1 happen and have the test-suite run.

[22:45] <AbsintheSyringe> maybe a weird question, but what's the preferred way of updating raring?
[22:45] <Laney> updating to or updating within?
[22:45] <AbsintheSyringe> on my debian sid I don't even have software updater installed, I do them all via "dist-upgrade", sometimes "safe-upgrade"
[22:46] <AbsintheSyringe> Laney, (long time no see) just doing system upgrade, should I rely more on software updater or sticking to terminal is ok?
[22:47] <Laney> yo!
[22:47] <AbsintheSyringe> Laney, hey hey :)
[22:47] <AbsintheSyringe> someones trying to move over to Ubuntu :P
[22:47] <Laney> I usually use apt-get but update-manager is the recommended way
[22:47] <Laney> ++
[22:48] <AbsintheSyringe> heh, ok I said it's a weird question because it doesn't seem that unstable to be honest
[22:48] <Laney> that's a bad thing? :P
[22:48] <AbsintheSyringe> on Sid if you're not careful enough you could do a lot of damage when updating
[22:49] <AbsintheSyringe> no, I just can't get used to it
[22:50] <AbsintheSyringe> Laney, pity you never made it to Debconf :)
[22:50] <AbsintheSyringe> "that" debconf
[22:50] <Laney> or any other - yeah, it is
[22:50] <AbsintheSyringe> going to fosdem?
[22:50] <Laney> sadly not
[22:51] <Laney> shouldn't be that hard to get to debconf this year though
[22:51] <AbsintheSyringe> yea, we'll see each other around
[22:52] <AbsintheSyringe> it shouldn't sponsorships should be open soonish
[22:52] <AbsintheSyringe> maybe in Feb
[23:19] <cjwatson> AbsintheSyringe: raring has a kind of partial equivalent of Debian unstable->testing migration applied to it these days
[23:19] <cjwatson> AbsintheSyringe: I tend to use dist-upgrade personally
[23:21] <cjwatson> if you're familiar with it it's fine; it's certainly not *unsupported*, any recommendation of update-manager is more to do with it being a more integrated user experience or whatever than actually having importantly different semantics
[23:22] <AbsintheSyringe> cjwatson, ah great, in that case I'll just stick to dist-upgrade
[23:23] <AbsintheSyringe> cjwatson, tnx (another long time no see) :)
[23:25] <cjwatson> aye :)
[23:42] <AbsintheSyringe> cjwatson, are you going to fosdem?
