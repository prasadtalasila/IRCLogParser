[08:30] <Subfusc> what do you mean yet? its morning here
[08:30] <newguy123> night time here
[08:31] <newguy123> well early morning
[08:40] <newguy123> hi aguy
[08:45] <newguy123> hi boot
[08:47] <newguy123> soes anyone talk in here?
[08:47] <Nutty> no
[08:47] <newguy123> how come?
[08:48] <jubei> hello. I am trying to go from unity to kubuntu but I'm struggling a little. I 've removed unity* then installed kde-standard and kde-full as well as kubuntu-desktop
[08:48] <Nutty> anyone know where I can find visual fingerprint analyis software
[08:48] <jubei> the result is now I get a kde-like login screen but after that login screen I get an empty desktop
[08:48] <jubei> I've deleted everything under ~/.config just to be sure but no effect
[08:49] <jubei> any ideas on how to troubleshoot it?
[08:50] <jubei> oh I just realized I was logging into "default" , I'm not trying plasma
[08:50] <jubei> now*
[08:54] <Subfusc> jubei: kde use .kde[4] as config directory
[08:54] <jubei> Subfusc: login to kde plasma worked fine
[08:54] <jubei> Subfusc: i was logging in to some "default" session
[08:54] <Subfusc> jubei: it was more FYI ;)

[10:44] <kotTon_kaNdiy> hey das
[10:44] <kotTon_kaNdiy> das boot
[10:44] <Das_Auge> I got a problem with my kubuntu notebook:
[10:44] <kotTon_kaNdiy> ok
[10:44] <kotTon_kaNdiy> which is?
[10:45] <Das_Auge> Most of the time I am using it with an external display. So by default the internal display is swiched off. But when use the notebook onroad, I start it, and the internal screen remains black.
[10:46] <kotTon_kaNdiy> have you checked your bios settings?
[11:08] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[11:41] <kid_> Hi all
[11:41] <heoyea> yelo
[11:42] <kid_> after creating a 2nd account I dont have permission on files
[11:42] <heoyea> o
[11:42] <kid_> for example I'm in ~/Desktop and create a file test.c with nano, I wont be able to save it
[11:43] <BluesKaj> kid_, di you setup file share permissions
[11:44] <BluesKaj> did you rather
[11:44] <kid_> BluesKaj : what's that ?
[11:44] <kid_> With the 1st user I don't have problems but I do with the 2nd
[11:44] <heoyea> maybe ur not part of a group?
[11:45] <heoyea> cat /etc/group
[11:45] <BluesKaj> as the primary user , you set up the folder permissions to share
[11:45] <kid_> I created a group called partage
[11:46] <heoyea> maybe use chown then
[11:47] <kid_> and what should I see in /etc/group ?
[11:47] <heoyea> u should see ur user name next to the group that u want access to
[11:47] <heoyea> like storage, video ..etc
[11:48] <kid_> both are in sudo
[11:49] <kid_> while the 1st is in adm, cdrom and plugdev
[11:49] <heoyea> yea add ur new user name if u want the same access
[11:50] <heoyea> next to it
[11:51] <kid_> how to add and next to what ?
[11:54] <BluesKaj> kid_, why would you want to use another or differnt username anyway , for control over another user 's access ?
[11:58] <kid_> BluesKaj : 2 sessions for 2 desktop environnements.
[11:58] <kid_> I'm testing kde and cinnamon and the cleaner way to do that is to have 2 accounts
[12:00] <kid_> I followed a tutorial in which I had to add the 2nd user to a group. But when I use the command line, I have restriction in  the new account
[12:03] <Das_Auge> kotTon_kaNdiy: It is not Bios, it is a KDE Setting. If I open a terminal and type "xrandr --auto" the internal screen reapperas. But I have to do that blindly...
[12:03] <kotTon_kaNdiy> even after a reboot?
[12:05] <Peace-> kid_: what did you do exacly?
[12:06] <Das_Auge> Yes: Turn off PC, unplugg HDMI, turn on PC, Log-in-Screen is shown, Log in, Display gets black.
[12:06] <Das_Auge> I set in the KDE Screen settings (german: Anzeige-Einstellungen) extern-only to default to avoid that the internal notebook-display is shown.
[12:09] <kid_> Peace : sudo adduser, addgroup, adduser to group, chgrp -R /home/1st and 2nd user, and then symbolic links on repertory and files (ln -s)
[12:10] <Das_Auge> kotTon_kaNdiy: Before setting this, KDE always asked me wheter I want to enter the Settings to configure the Display.
[12:11] <BluesKaj> I had our laptop connected a monitor via vga and the setting in dispaly and monitor in system settings , had the option tun the laptop screen off . Is there such an option with your setuo , Das_Auge?
[12:12] <Das_Auge> BluesKaj: Yes.
[12:12]  * BluesKaj put son his glasses
[12:13] <Das_Auge> BluesKaj: I have turned the screen off by default.
[12:13] <BluesKaj> and it's not keeping your settings ?
[12:14] <Das_Auge> BluesKaj: It is keeping the setting, even if I plugg off the external monitor. As a result I cannot see the desktop of all, after that. Thats my problem.
[12:14] <Peace-> kid_: mm well kid it's not so easy understand well what you did btw you could just try to reboot
[12:14] <Das_Auge> "of all" = "at all"
[12:14] <Peace-> kid_: even if this is not a linux solution
[12:15] <Peace-> kid_: btw i do always sudo adduser $USER admin
[12:15] <Peace-> for my user
[12:16] <BluesKaj> Das_Auge, so before using " no hdmi " setting make sure you set it back to the default
[12:19] <Das_Auge> I can't know that before, BluesKaj. If I turn off the Computer and the next day I put it in my bag to turn it on in the train, I remain without display.
[12:19] <Das_Auge> Is there any way to tell KDE: "If there ist only LVDS1 plugged in, turn it on. If there is also HDMI1, plugg LVDS1 off"?
[12:20] <Das_Auge> I already did a workaround: a global shortcut runs "xrandr --output HDMI1 --off --output LVDS1 --auto --scale 1x1 --panning 1366x768"
[12:20] <Das_Auge> But its only a workaround.
[12:21] <Peace-> Das_Auge: mm you could do a udev rule
[12:21] <Peace-> Das_Auge: for example when i plug in my nokia i did a udev rule that says
[12:21] <Peace-> if nokia is plugged on usb run this script
[12:21] <Das_Auge> that sounds interesting. Never heard about udev rules.
[12:21] <Peace-> you could do that
[12:22] <BluesKaj> Das_Auge, this might be a situation that calls for a startup script  , justa s Peace-  suggests
[12:22] <Peace-> Das_Auge: i dunno if you can do with screen
[12:22] <Peace-> Das_Auge: but if i were you i would try
[12:22] <Peace-> Das_Auge: i can give you my website link where i describe what i did for my nokia
[12:24] <kid_> Peace : I'll show you the tutorial, wait a minuute
[12:25] <XiaYixuan> hi
[12:25] <XiaYixuan> can you say me how to write the mp3 to a cd so that a regular cd player can play it? (e.g. one that can't play mp3)
[12:25] <kid_> Peace : http://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=fr&ie=UTF-8&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Flehollandaisvolant.net%2Flinux%2Fgkde%2F&act=url
[12:26] <kid_> From part 8 to the end
[12:26] <kid_> it is a translation so there"re mistakes
[12:26] <BluesKaj> XiaYixuan, install soundkonverter , then use it to convert the mp3s to wav files that you then burn to a cd
[12:27]  * Das_Auge ist looking up for udev at ubuntuusers.de
[12:27] <XiaYixuan> how do I burn? only cda plays
[12:27] <XiaYixuan> the player can't play wav ._.
[12:28] <Peace-> Das_Auge: http://nowardev.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/nokia-5800-udev-rules-to-automount/
[12:28] <Peace-> Das_Auge: in that udev rule i run a script
[12:29] <Peace-> Das_Auge: you need to identy i guess with sudo lshw  the id of your monitor
[12:29] <BluesKaj> XiaYixuan, , van't play wav ? it the kind of file from which all standard cds are burned
[12:29] <Peace-> Das_Auge: after taht modify that udev rule
[12:29] <Peace-> Das_Auge: and create your own script
[12:30] <Peace-> XiaYixuan: ?
[12:31] <XiaYixuan> Peace-: never mind
[12:32] <BluesKaj> XiaYixuan, also install kubuntu-restricted-extras to make sure you have the proper codecs and drm (libdvdcss2)
[12:34] <Das_Auge> no result with sudo lshw. It says nothing about a display. Only the graphics chip.
[12:34] <Das_Auge> Peace-:
[12:34] <Peace-> Das_Auge: dsmeg ?
[12:35] <Peace-> Das_Auge: dmesg
[12:35]  * Das_Auge is trying dsmeg
[12:35] <Peace-> wrong command
[12:35] <Peace-> :P
[12:36] <Das_Auge> Peace-: Strike!
[12:37] <Das_Auge> Peace-: http://paste.kde.org/644954/
[12:38] <Das_Auge> But I dont know which information to use.
[12:38] <Peace-> wait a moment
[12:40] <Peace-> Das_Auge: i am reading my notes
[12:41] <Peace-> Das_Auge: udevadm monitor
[12:41] <Peace-> Das_Auge: plug in and remove the monitor
[12:41] <Peace-> see what it says
[12:45] <Das_Auge> It says: monitor will print the received events for:
[12:45] <Das_Auge> UDEV - the event which udev sends out after rule processing
[12:45] <Das_Auge> KERNEL - the kernel uevent
[12:46] <Peace-> ok you have plugin the monitor ?
[12:46] <Peace-> have oyu
[12:53] <Das_Auge> Peace-: Now I got It: http://paste.kde.org/644972/
[12:53] <Peace-> Das_Auge: ok so subsystem is drm
[12:54] <Das_Auge> mmhhmm
[12:55] <Peace-> Das_Auge: we are searching for some etiquette => udev rules = does some stuff  when you feel these etiquette
[12:55] <Peace-> etiquete are specific for one device
[12:55] <Peace-> in my case subsystem was usb because my nokia was plugged with usb
[12:55] <Peace-> cable
[12:56] <Peace-> if you are not very specific wth etiquette \ ATTR a rule or an action can be loaded by udev even for different device that has the same etiquette
[12:56] <Peace-> i dunno if you have understood
[12:58] <Peace-> Das_Auge: if you want more ATTR  try this
[12:58] <Peace-> Das_Auge: udevadm info -a -p  $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/dri/card0)
[12:58] <Peace-> with that you should be able to identify all the ATTR (i guess attribute of your device )
[12:59] <Peace-> Das_Auge: it's not easy man you need to test your udev rules
[13:00] <Peace-> it will take you time to understand
[13:01] <Das_Auge> Peace-: indeed
[13:26] <Das_Auge> Peace-: I got an idea: KDE already has a rule: Every time I plug in the monitor it asks me what to do. What about copying that rule? But I dont know where it is.
[13:26] <Peace-> Das_Auge: try to google hdmi udev
[13:27] <Peace-> Das_Auge: you should get something that fit you
[13:27] <Das_Auge> I already tried.
[13:27] <Peace-> Das_Auge: video card ? nvidia
[13:27] <Das_Auge> I got now another Idea:
[13:28] <Das_Auge> cat /sys/class/drm/card0/card0-HDMI-A-1/status tells me "connected" or "disconnected"
[13:29] <Peace-> the problem it's that you need to use SUBSYSTEM and ATTR
[13:29] <Peace-> to identify a device
[13:29] <Peace-> so...
[13:29] <Peace-> udev can do an ACTION
[13:29] <Peace-> That in your case will be the xrand stuff
[13:30] <Das_Auge> what about making a startup script (f.e. in KDE Autostart) which controlls if the external monitor is plugged in. Depending on that it does a xrandr command.
[13:30] <Peace-> Das_Auge: yes you could do that too
[13:30] <Das_Auge> the problem: I dont know the sh script language.
[13:31] <Peace-> xD
[13:32] <Peace-> if [[  "$(command you want )"  ==  "value you know" ]]; then   command you want run ; else command when cable is not plugged ; fi
[13:32] <Peace-> Das_Auge: ^
[13:33] <Das_Auge> thanks, Peace-!

[14:34] <BluesKaj> metap0d, have you used gnome ? that's the cartooney GUI

[15:14] <pawel_> hi, is there any way to install software from USC in Kubuntu?
[15:14] <Wizard> pawel_: Sure.
[15:14] <pawel_> I mean sofware like proprietary games
[15:14] <BluesKaj> is USC hosting an ubuntu repository ?
[15:15] <Wizard> BluesKaj: I don't think it's regular repo.
[15:15] <Wizard> But I bet USC installed under Kubuntu will behave normally :)
[15:15] <Obsidian1723> BluesKaj: check launchpad since it could be in a PPA
[15:15] <pawel_> BluesKaj: I tried to install Legend of Grimrock that I bought in humbleboundle, but it doesn't want to install in Kubuntu
[15:16] <pawel_> Wizard: yeah, but USC wants doezens of trash
[15:16] <BluesKaj> pawel_, you need to install wine to run windows apps/gamesin kubuntu
[15:17] <Obsidian1723> Who needs uSC when you have apt-get, aptittude, and synaptic?
[15:18] <pawel_> Obsidian1723: but they can't install proprietary games that are available via USC
[15:18] <Obsidian1723> If you want games, use Windows... if you want to get real work done, use Linux,.
[15:19] <pawel_> Obsidian1723: what a great idea, if you don't want to help be quiet, ok?
[15:19] <Obsidian1723> Linux will never compete with Windows for gaming... too much R&D, money, and financial as well as technical (thus really Business) resources behind the games.
[15:19] <pawel_> Obsidian1723: it will, but it doesn't matter for now
[15:19] <pawel_> I just want to install games that are available via USC
[15:19] <Obsidian1723> Well, I'd suggest WINE, but if you want to run Windows programs, why not just run Windows?
[15:19] <pawel_> they're LINUX games
[15:19] <Wizard> Obsidian1723: This is not a solution :/
[15:20] <Wizard> pawel_: You may later uninstall USC and it's dependencies.
[15:20] <Wizard> Dirty workaround, but should work :)
[15:20] <Obsidian1723> Well, what about going to an Ubuntu machine, installing the games and repacking them into a DEB file and then install that on the Kubuntu box?
[15:20] <pawel_> Wizard: true, I'll probably do it this way
[15:20] <Wizard> Obsidian1723:  pointless, IMO :)
[15:21] <Obsidian1723> sudo apt-get install dpkg-repack (if you don't have it)
[15:21]  * Wizard facepalsm
[15:21] <pawel_> or perhaps, install Ubuntu in virtual machine and start downloading the game - it should add ppa in /etc/apt/sources.list.d, right?
[15:22] <Wizard> pawel_: I'm not sure. I installe IntelliJ from USC and it haven't added anything.
[15:22] <Wizard> It just downloaded deb from some webservice and installed it with dpkg :|
[15:22] <pawel_> Wizard: ok, I'll install USC
[15:23] <Wizard> That's the only solution, I'm afraid.
[15:23] <pawel_> Wizard: ok, thanks for your help
[15:23] <Obsidian1723> Hopefully it won't break Kubuntu.
[15:23] <pawel_> Obsidian1723: it won't
[15:24] <Wizard> How could it?
[15:25] <Obsidian1723> If it doesn
[15:25]  * BluesKaj facepalms
[15:25] <Obsidian1723> t change any repos, I guess it wouldn't.
[15:25] <Obsidian1723> I haven't used regular Ubuntu in quite some time.
[15:25] <metap0d> Why are you almost intentionally giving him chalk fulls of incorrect information?
[15:26] <metap0d> If you're unsure, stop talking.
[15:26] <Obsidian1723> I would just investigate it before you toss something like that on a system, but hey, it's his system, not mine. Go for it.
[15:27] <pawel_> Obsidian1723: thanks, but I'm quite handy in Linux and I know it won't breake a thing :)
[15:27] <pawel_> break*
[15:28] <BluesKaj> not if the games are listed in the ubuntu repos :)
[15:29] <pawel_> BluesKaj: afaik they're not
[15:30] <Subfusc> USC is defaultly installed in Kubuntu?
[15:30] <Subfusc> I can bring it up and I havent installed it
[15:31] <pawel_> Subfusc: no, it's not
[15:31] <BluesKaj> heh, when you mentioned USC , I thought you werfe talking about the unviersity , not the ubuntu software center ,...too many sortforms nowadays
[15:31] <BluesKaj> short
[15:31] <pawel_> Subfusc: there's different application
[15:31]  * RagnaRok__ yawns
[15:31] <RagnaRok__> night guys
[15:32] <pawel_> BluesKaj: sorry about that :)
[15:32] <BluesKaj> hence my confusion , the software center is the repository to me
[15:32] <BluesKaj> np pawel_ :)
[15:33] <Subfusc> pawel_: there is more than one USC?
[15:33] <pawel_> BluesKaj: then I can check if there's additional repo in Ubuntu
[15:33] <pawel_> Subfusc: in Kubuntu it's just different application: Muon Software Center
[15:34] <Subfusc> erhm, okay
[15:34] <BluesKaj> I still use synaptic ...old school
[15:34] <Subfusc> I still use yum :}
[15:34] <BluesKaj> just for reference . apt-get is still my install engine
[15:35] <pawel_> I'm using apt-get and I always copy dependencies to some file to be able to purge some application completely
[15:36] <Wizard> pawel_: apt-get autoremove does it pretty well :)
[15:36] <pawel_> Wizard: it usually lefts many packages that are shared with other applications
[15:37] <pawel_> I miss something like: Pacman -Rsn ;)
[15:37] <Wizard> pawel_: If they're shared - they're needed - simple.
[15:38] <pawel_> Wizard: yeah, but they're not needed, but optional
[15:38] <Wizard> Ah in *that* manner. You can tell apt-get not to install optional and suggested dependencies :)
[15:39] <Wizard> I think Ubuntu installs optionals by default.
[15:39] <Wizard> But I'm unsure.
[15:40] <pawel_> Wizard: well, you're probably right in both cases
[15:41] <Wizard> Personally I treat it as a compromise. Kubuntu offers me painless setup taking few megabytes in favour ;)
[15:42]  * Wizard goes afk to watch ski jumping competition in Zakopane.
[15:42] <Wizard> o/
[15:45] <pawel_> Wizard: nice, I live near Zakopane btw. :)
[15:48] <BluesKaj> pawel_, where is Zakopane?
[15:49] <pawel_> in the south in Poland
[15:50] <BluesKaj> right, just looked it up
[16:18] <Aurelio> There we go, just had to install the addons.

[19:44] <harris> i need it
[19:45] <Linkmaster> I remember something like this happening to me once, awhile ago. I don't know pear linux very well however, so I don't know how old/new it is, what's on it, etc., etc.
[19:45] <harris> have a hp pavilion dv6000

[19:47] <Peace-> harris: i have the same machine and with kubuntu it works well
[19:47] <Linkmaster> If you partioned /home away from your system, you'll be able to install to kubu w/ no worries
[19:47] <Peace-> harris: ok but in this channel you can't get support for that

[20:19] <Guest91465> hi, I'm having trouble with automatic clipboard copying, it doesn't work anymore: when I select a piece of text with the mouse, it won't be pastable in another place. any ideas?
[20:20] <Peace-> Guest91465: guess you need to see the settings
[20:20] <Peace-> Guest91465: right click on clipboard
[20:21] <Peace-> Guest91465: sorry right click on klipper icon
[20:21] <Peace-> Guest91465: so configure klipper
[20:21] <Guest91465> ok, let's see
[20:21] <Guest91465> it's the scissors icon app, right?
[20:22] <Peace-> Guest91465: http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/12/plasma-desktopJe3022.png
[20:22] <Guest91465> thnx
[20:26] <Guest91465> ok, Peace- , the text gets copied but it's not pasted, for example, copying some text from rekonq or firefox is detected by klipper, but it won't be copied on kwrite or google search box. weird...
[20:31] <Guest91465> Peace-, copypasting with the keyboard does work: ctrl-c, ctrl-v

[23:06] <quesada> how trushworthy is the webupd8 ppa?
[23:06] <quesada> I want oracle java
[23:15] <TheLordOfTime> quesada, i use it even on production systems
[23:15] <TheLordOfTime> all it is is a script/wrapper to download/install the oracle java software, it doesn't contain any actual code, what code it does install all comes from Oracle directly.
[23:15] <TheLordOfTime> quesada, long-story-short if you need oracle (aka "sun") java, use the ppa.
[23:15] <TheLordOfTime> otherwise, openjdk's java should be sufficient (oracle's said as much)
[23:20] <quesada> I only need it for intellij pycharm
[23:20] <quesada> should work with openjdk, but they don't support it
