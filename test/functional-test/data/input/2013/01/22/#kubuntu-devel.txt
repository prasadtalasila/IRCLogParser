[12:04] <Riddell> afiestas: dood kscreen rocks
[12:04] <Riddell> afiestas: only comment I'd make is that it's possible to separate two screens so you have a desktop space which is not on any desktop, that could get troublesome losing windows
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[12:29] <yofel__> hm
[12:29] <yofel__> yofel_: test kscreen when you're home
[12:29] <Riddell> it works great, you just plug in and it works!
[12:29] <Riddell> and then when you unplug it does the right thing too
[12:29] <Riddell> even works if you suspend then unplug
[12:32] <shadeslayer> awesome :)
[12:32] <shadeslayer> btw do we have work items that we could point beginners to?
[12:33] <Riddell> we have work items https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/topic-raring-flavor-kubuntu
[12:33] <Riddell> dunno if any are junior jobs but would be worth working that out
[12:33] <shadeslayer> =)
[12:33] <shadeslayer> maybe bug triage? :P
[12:34] <shadeslayer> but then we don't want to scare them away ....
[12:35] <shadeslayer> I've sent a link to the packaging guide, that seems like a good start
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[13:14] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: btw I forgot to ask, what's your email ID?
[13:15] <shadeslayer> I haven't started with the email, was too busy last night, probably first thing to do tomorrow morning
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[13:38] <Riddell> shadeslayer: sent where?
[13:40] <shadeslayer> sent what where?
[13:40] <Riddell> 12:35 < shadeslayer> I've sent a link to the packaging guide
[13:41] <shadeslayer> ah
[13:41] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I'm not sure, but do you know Akarsh Simha? ( kstar on IRC )
[13:42] <shadeslayer> his brother is interested in working on Kubuntu
[13:42] <shadeslayer> which is why I asked if we had any JJ's
[13:42] <Riddell> get him onto IRC is the first step :)
[13:42] <shadeslayer> in the mean time, I've sent him a link to the packaging guide to get started :)
[13:42] <shadeslayer> yeah, I've also asked him to do that :)
[13:45] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd is another likely talent to be friendly to

[21:07] <afiestas> Riddell: that's a "feature" we have to hide better
[21:20] <Riddell> afiestas: what's the possible use for it?
[21:21] <afiestas> Riddell: weird ppl with weird needs
[21:21] <afiestas> we should support it, but it should be well hidden
[21:29] <yofel> afiestas: btw. what happens when I disable the only screen left and press available? (I didn't feel like trying it out)
[21:30] <yofel> er... press apply
[21:30] <afiestas> and press what?
[21:30] <afiestas> brb
[21:37] <afiestas> won't happen anything in theory, we check that
[22:40] <ScottK> Riddell: No thanks.

[23:51] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: nice, I will do one now and can you verify the package ?
[23:54] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: packages from sourceforge are ok?
