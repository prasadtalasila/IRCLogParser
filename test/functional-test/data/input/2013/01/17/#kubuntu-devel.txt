[09:19] <Riddell> brr, cold today!
[09:21] <jussi> Riddell: pesh, cold :P
[09:22] <Riddell> yeah yeah you hardy arctic types are used to below zero, some of us like having our gulf stream to keep us warm
[09:23] <Riddell> RC3!
[09:24] <tazz> Riddell, I know what you mean, its cold here too. Its almost 24 Degrees Celsius.
[09:24] <tazz> XD
[09:25] <Riddell> tazz: I have a spare Kubuntu wooly jumper if you need it
[09:25] <Riddell> yofel_: kate package seems to have ended up with version no of 4:4.9.97-0ubuntu1~ubuntu13.04
[09:25] <Riddell> presumably just a script doing a funny thing?
[09:34] <yofel__> Riddell: either that or bzr had a funny version. IIRC it just takes the version from there
[09:37] <yofel__> Riddell: ah, kubuntu-archive-upload line 116ff needs improvement

[10:13] <Quintasan_> I is on a streak
=== Quintasan_ is now known as Quintasan
[10:13] <Quintasan> Riddell: I'll be working on maliit today
[10:14] <Quintasan> things went way better than I had expected
[10:14] <Riddell> Quintasan: what things went better?
[10:14] <Quintasan> tests
[10:14] <Riddell> oh cool
[10:15] <Riddell> well done :)
[10:15] <Quintasan> unexpectedly I aced one
[10:15] <Quintasan> the strangest part is that I did not prepare for it
[10:16]  * Quintasan feels damn lucky
[10:16] <Riddell> you're just a natural genius
[10:16] <Quintasan> lol
[10:16] <Quintasan> hell no
[10:17] <Quintasan> Riddell: or maybe, if you consider my inner random() function to generate the right answer :P
[10:18] <Quintasan> whatever, I have to buy some food on way home and will get to it
[10:18] <Quintasan> hopefully I will have plugins done as well this weekend
[10:34] <jussi> grumble, wheres shadeslayer when I need him
[10:36] <tsimpson> hiding from you, obviously :)
[10:41] <jussi> hehe, yeah, likely
[10:41] <jussi> but he did ask me to test something...
[10:51] <Riddell> here's a question, would using -proposed not be as good as using kubuntu-ninjas?
[10:52] <Riddell> ah but not secret I suppose
[10:52] <Riddell> hmm
[11:04] <yofel__> it also has a very high build priority so we get the packages built ASAP which is nice
[11:04] <yofel__> the archive would be slower I think
[11:05] <Riddell> really?  slower than a private PPA?
[11:06] <yofel__> well, a private PPA has essentially the highest priority you can get on the PPA builders
[11:06] <yofel__> if the archive has a queue we're sitting in there like everybody else
[11:06] <Riddell> yeah, wouldn't want to be behind gtk packages :)
[11:06] <yofel__> :D
[11:07] <Riddell> shadeslayer: I think that netrunner user who had the install issue "windows not detected" was just confused by the lack of label
[11:07] <Riddell> nothing on the installer says "windows" on the relevant partition
[11:07] <Riddell> I can see how that would be confusing
[11:07] <Riddell> http://starsky.19inch.net/~jr/tmp/ubiquity.png  vs  http://starsky.19inch.net/~jr/tmp/ubiquity1.png
[11:11] <Riddell> so if you're bored of packaging feel free to take that up, xnox will tell you it's not hard I'm sure :)
[11:11] <Riddell> or we could convince agateau it's a KDE bug and counts as a last mile :)
[11:13] <xnox> the text and widgets are there.... you just need to name them the same way....
[11:13] <xnox> the kubiquity screenshot looks like ubiquity from ~maverick time.
[11:14] <Riddell> it hasn't had much love indeed
[11:15] <Riddell> I think it's more than a case of "just name them" there's a lot of code differences in the disk setup page alas 
[11:16] <Riddell> yofel__: kubuntu_revert_285553e.diff is still needed, did you report that as a bug upstream?
[11:16] <Riddell> hmm, brightness, isn't that afiestas's area?
[11:18] <yofel__> IIRC ScottK already poked afiestas, not sure
[11:30] <Riddell> 11:08 < Riddell> pinheiro: what's your opinion on the current state of the oxygen font?  is it ready for distros to pick up?
[11:30] <Riddell> 11:23 < pinheiro> Riddell: you should include it
[11:30] <Riddell> 11:23 < pinheiro> screen wise .... not so much
[11:31] <Riddell> apachelogger: upstream go ahead for archive, want to put it in the archive or shall I?
[11:32] <yofel__> I tried it as a system font for a day - didn't really work for me as I couldn't get the hinting settings right. Some character was always fuzzy - doesn't happen with the ubuntu font
[11:33] <Riddell> right, that's why he's saying it's not for screen use
[11:33] <Riddell> but then he's also saying ubuntu font isn't for screen use :)
[11:42] <jussi> hrm, has anyone got a messed up chromium atm? 
[11:42] <jussi> single tab is very weird looking for me
[11:54] <apachelogger> Riddell: I'd first clearify what exactly is a good idea to include in a distro .... there are like 3 copies of the font in various dirs or something :P
[12:03] <Riddell> kubuntu-full seems to be installing ok now I fixed kdegames
[12:41] <shadeslayer> mmm
[12:41] <shadeslayer> jussi: ssup
[12:42] <jussi> shadeslayer: see pm..
[13:06] <dantti_laptop> hi, you may want to patch print-manager for 4.10 with https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kdeutils/print-manager/repository/revisions/d889135b42c809f29a83d0a386915cc88a1b82b6
[13:06] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[13:06] <dantti_laptop> it was reverted since upstream CUPS 1.6 doesn't support it, but ubuntu has a patched version that does.
[13:14] <shadeslayer> dantti_laptop: I've added it to the notes, will upload a version with the patch later 
[13:16] <dantti_laptop> shadeslayer: thanks :)
[13:42] <ScottK> Riddell: Re the revert, afiestas was trying to fix the flickering.  I was going to write kde-devel/release about reverting upstream before 4.10, but didn't manage it yet.
[13:43] <Riddell> shadeslayer, dantti_laptop: added

[16:42] <Riddell> agateau: ping?
[16:43] <agateau> Riddell: pong
[16:44] <Riddell> agateau: I need you git mastery
[16:44] <Riddell> agateau: I just committed 245ba2956bd3fad7151ee46024d207917fdd1a06 to master in kde-workspace
[16:45] <Riddell> then did a git checkout remotes/origin/KDE/4.10
[16:45] <Riddell> then..
[16:45] <Riddell> jr@gallus:~/src/kde/kde-workspace/libs/plasmagenericshell>git cherry-pick 245ba2956bd3fad7151ee46024d207917fdd1a06
[16:45] <Riddell> [detached HEAD f72fa75] add missing linking target 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
[16:46] <Riddell> git add CMakeLists.txt
[16:46] <Riddell> git commit
[16:46] <Riddell> but I get ..
[16:46] <Riddell> nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
[16:46] <agateau> Riddell: "git checkout remotes/origin/KDE/4.10" that looks wrong
[16:47] <agateau> You should have switched to the KDE/4.10 branch with "git checkout KDE/4.10"
[16:47] <agateau> then pulled the remote code with "git pull"
[16:47] <agateau> then do the git cherry-pick
[16:48] <agateau> You shouldn't have to do any "git add" or "git commit" after a cherry pick
[16:48] <shadeslayer> but if you don't have that branch tracked, you need to do git checkout --track origin/KDE/4.10
[16:48] <agateau> shadeslayer: doesn't git do this for you these days?
[16:48] <shadeslayer> also, it's better to do a commit in 4.10 and then merge to master
[16:48] <shadeslayer> agateau: dunno, old habit of mine I guess
[16:49] <shadeslayer> I always do a --track
[16:49] <agateau> yes, can't hurt
[16:50] <agateau> Riddell: but then maybe we should first get you out of your "detached HEAD" state
[16:50] <shadeslayer> heh
[16:50] <Riddell> agateau: no change
[16:50] <Riddell> http://paste.kde.org/649766/
[16:50] <agateau> Riddell: what does "git branch" says?
[16:50] <Riddell> I don't want my head detached!  this git thing is dangerous!
[16:51] <Riddell> agateau: http://paste.kde.org/649778/
[16:51] <Riddell> dunno what sreich is doing in there
[16:51] <agateau> ah no, so it's ok
[16:51] <agateau> Riddell: when you do a cherry-pick, git creates a commit automatically
[16:51] <agateau> no need to add or commit anything
[16:51] <Riddell> oh wait I just did something
[16:51] <Riddell> http://commits.kde.org/kde-workspace/374024abc92dcd73fa9fd19444803c85ae7c3145
[16:51] <agateau> if you run git log you should see your commit
[16:52] <agateau> can't see anything, but maybe it takes time to appear on quickgit
[16:52] <Riddell> not very quick then!
[16:52] <agateau> :)
[16:53]  * agateau pulls from kde-workspace
[16:53] <Riddell> why on earth do you not have to commit?  this is totally unintuitive
[16:54]  * Riddell ports kde to bzr
[16:54] <shadeslayer> "[USN-1694-1] RPM vulnerability"
[16:54] <shadeslayer> hehehe
[16:54] <agateau> Riddell: it makes it easy to do several cherry-picks in a row
[16:54] <Riddell> agateau: sounds like it makes it easy to mess up!
[16:54] <agateau> Riddell: commits are local anyway, so you can easily undo them before pushing
[16:55] <Riddell> shadeslayer: that's not very nice, laughing at people with a security issue!
[16:55] <Riddell> agateau: so did my commit get in?
[16:56] <agateau> I see a commit which says "add missing linking target" from you on KDE/4.10
[16:56] <Riddell> yay
[16:56] <Riddell> I am git master!
[16:56] <agateau> :)
[16:57] <agateau> Riddell: next time, use --no-commit if git cherry-pick frightens you :)
[16:59] <shadeslayer> or better yet commit in 4.10 first :P

[17:36] <shadeslayer> yofel: nope

[17:37] <Riddell> marble will need that
[17:37] <shadeslayer> doing it
[17:37] <shadeslayer> erm okay
[17:37] <shadeslayer> should I talk to the LP build people
[17:37] <yofel> done
[17:38] <shadeslayer> I think it might be the issue yofel reported against qemu
[17:38] <shadeslayer> though I don't remember the bug number for that
[17:38] <yofel> firefox to the rescue - bug 1077116

[17:38] <shadeslayer> it was something related to moc-qt4 and I see that the build fails as soon as moc-qt4 is called
[17:38] <yofel> it is automoc that fails
[17:39] <shadeslayer> mmm
[17:40] <shadeslayer> time to talk to the lp people I guess, googling the error doesn't give anything
[17:41] <yofel> would be good if you could, nobody paid attention to me
[17:41] <shadeslayer> hehe
[17:42]  * yofel goes backporting libqa... and libwlocate in the meanwhile
[17:42] <shadeslayer> hehehe
[17:51]  * yofel wonders what this is: -./usr/bin/accessibleapps
[17:52] <Riddell> yofel: it's a test application 
[17:52] <Riddell> I think
[17:52] <Riddell> fregl can confirm
[17:52] <yofel> ah ok, sounds plausible
[17:55] <Riddell> ScottK: kate breaks because the .py files are put into site-packages instead of dist-packages, 4.9.97 no longer compiles either so it's not a change in kate but something in the stack, any bright ideas on what?
[17:57] <Riddell> ${PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES_INSTALL_DIR} changed I guess
[17:58]  * yofel remember reading a mail about something like that on kde-release
[18:02] <Riddell> mm FindPythonLibrary.cmake from kdelibs has changed a bit
[18:09] <fregl> yofel: yes, it is our little test tool for accessibility - similar to accerciser from gnome. not so important for packaging, but might be nice to have if it's not too much work :)
[18:19] <yofel> Riddell: did you try building kate with INSTALL_PYTHON_FILES_IN_PYTHON_PREFIX set to true?
[18:21] <Riddell> mm no, that would probably do it as well
[18:21] <Riddell> but hardcoding "site-packages" must be wrong
[18:22] <Riddell> we don't want to have to set INSTALL_PYTHON_FILES_IN_PYTHON_PREFIX for everything
[18:23] <yofel> true :/
[18:28] <yofel> Riddell: maybe hardcode it to true for now in FindPythonLibrary.cmake?
[18:28] <Riddell> kindae defeats the point no?
[18:29] <yofel> well, this seems like a change trageted at devs from what I understand. I don't see a reason to use it for the distro packages
[18:31] <Riddell> well it works fine and puts them in the right place except it hardcodes "site-packages"
[18:32] <Riddell> but I guess settings INSTALL_PYTHON_FILES_IN_PYTHON_PREFIX by default is much the same as reverting to the old version
[18:32] <yofel> yeah, as the previous default was asking python where to put it
[18:32] <yofel> I guess a mix of both would be needed here
[18:54] <Riddell> dantti_laptop: I'm not convinced this does work
