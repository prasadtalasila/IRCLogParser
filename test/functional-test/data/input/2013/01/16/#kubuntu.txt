[00:09] <keithzg_> So are there N7 builds yet? I'm tempted to try Plasma Active on my Nexus 7, but I don't want to have to fiddle around with removing all the Ubuntu/Unity/Gnome stuff. I mean, I'll do it if need be, but pre-built images would be great.

[01:51] <zacarias> Hi. My alt key is doing nothing with the "at" and the "euro" signs on the "2" and "3" keys. I can't type those signs. I tried several keyboard layouts, hardware, etc, without success. But before it used to do it. I don't know what happened. Any idea? Thanks

[03:25] <urlwolf> I want to try gnome 3, but have kubuntu. Will following these steps: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-get-complete-gnome-3-desktop-in.html break something?
[03:29] <DarthFrog> urlwolf: You're unlikely to get an answer here.  We're KDE folks, not GNOMEs.  I can say that you can install the ubuntu-desktop package and switch between desktop environments as you wish without problems.

[09:29] <kdns> Hi all. Can someone please tell me how to make my PC + WLAN card, act as an AP?
[09:30] <kdns> I've googled it and tried a bunch of things, to no avail....
[09:41] <ajazdzewski_> kdns: https://www.google.de/search?q=linux+wireless+access+point+howto
[09:42] <kdns> I already just said, I have googled it
[09:43] <ajazdzewski_> kdns: how do you like to build it?
[09:44] <ajazdzewski_> use the networmanager? configure it with wapsupplicatnt and co
[09:44] <kdns> I've tried creating it in network manager as adhoc, no AP appears (as seen from my phone). Tried as 'shared', same. Tried shared IP, DHCP, tried locking it to a specific card... literally everything I could do with every setting in network manager, nothing ever shows up ...
[09:44] <ajazdzewski_> dose your card support the ap mode?
[09:44] <kdns> ahh I didn't know it needed hardware support, I'll check. Thanks :)
[09:45] <kdns> yes, it does.

[10:11] <BTCOxygen> hi
[10:11] <BTCOxygen> On windows i can lock screen by pressing Winkey + L
[10:11] <BTCOxygen> Is there a shortcut key for Kubuntu?
[10:12] <BTCOxygen> to lock screen
[10:13] <jimbob6996> not that I can find, bt
[10:14] <neotheo> BTCOxygen: try CTRL + ALT + L
[10:15] <BTCOxygen> neotheo: thanks
[10:15] <jimbob6996> and ctrl+alt+T to switch to terminal
[10:15] <jimbob6996> makes sense
[10:15] <neotheo> didnt know that one :D
[10:15] <neotheo> doesnt work :(
[10:16] <lordievader> KDE doesn't have ctrl+alt+t as standard, that is to say, there is no standard key for the Konsole.
=== abhishek is now known as abhishek__
[10:16] <jimbob6996> not Konsole
[10:16] <lordievader> You can ofcourse set the Konsole to launch on ctrl + alt + t
[10:17] <jimbob6996> to exit to the terminal screen
[10:17] <jimbob6996> or k
[10:18] <lordievader> jimbob6996: Are you on Ubuntu? There ctrl + alt + t launches the Gnome terminal indeed.
[10:18] <jimbob6996> yup
[10:18] <jimbob6996> since this is a kubutnu chat room, I figured everyone was using it
[10:18] <lordievader> jimbob6996: Ah, this is Kubuntu, Kubuntu doesn't have a standard keyboard shortcut for the Konsole, the KDE terminal emulator.
[10:18] <jimbob6996> my bad

[12:16] <yossarianuk> Why does kubuntu not come with kwrite installed by default? seems better than Kate .
[12:19] <Riddell> yossarianuk: arbitrary choice I made back in the day, I prefer kate because it can load more than one document in one window which was in line with UI trends back then (tabbed browsing)
[12:40] <lordievader> Good afternoon
[13:14] <yossarianuk> would be good for kwrite to be installed by default...

[14:29] <FlashDeluxe> hi! i got a question: I am using the current kubuntu 32bit with 4G of RAM. Now if i do a free -m i see there are only 3275M of RAM, is it possible to use all of the 4G?
[14:30] <BTCOxygen> FlashDeluxe: No
[14:30] <BTCOxygen> FlashDeluxe: To use all 4GB you need to use the 64-bit edition
[14:31] <FlashDeluxe> BTCOxygen: but in theory 32bit could use up to 4G or am i wrong?
[14:32] <BTCOxygen> <FlashDeluxe> theory 32bit could use ~4G
[14:32] <BTCOxygen> ~ == apriximately
[14:32] <BTCOxygen> rox*
[14:32] <BTCOxygen> lol
[14:32] <BTCOxygen> typo
[14:32] <BTCOxygen> ok
[14:32] <FloodBotK1> BTCOxygen: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[14:33] <shadeslayer> let's approach this mathematically
[14:33] <lordievader> FlashDeluxe: Or you could you the PAE kernel, that one supports more than 3.7G of RAM.
[14:33] <BTCOxygen> <FlashDeluxe> theory 32bit could use around 4G
[14:33] <FlashDeluxe> yes, but in /proc/meminfo there is total memory of 3353648 kB Thats way to less?
[14:33] <shadeslayer> with 32 bits you can address 2^32 unique locations
[14:33] <BTCOxygen> FlashDeluxe: Thats normal for a 32-bit
[14:34] <FlashDeluxe> I got a windows 7 on another notebook with 32bit and there i get 4G running
[14:34] <FlashDeluxe> i will try the pae kernel and see whats happening
[14:35] <BTCOxygen> FlashDeluxe: or you could use 64-bit
[14:35] <FlashDeluxe> BTCOxygen: not on my notebook :(
[14:35] <lordievader> FlashDeluxe: Windows 32Bit sees the same amount of ram, they just say it is 4G...
[14:36] <BTCOxygen> FlashDeluxe: does your notebook support 64-bit ?
[14:36] <FlashDeluxe> BTCOxygen: nope :(
[14:37] <BTCOxygen> then i guess you have to go with the kernal lordievader mentioned
[14:38] <lordievader> FlashDeluxe: Btw you won't notice much difference between 3.7 and 4G, I'd say it is too much trouble for what is's worth.
[14:39] <FlashDeluxe> lordievader my problem is, that i am using 3,3G i would be happy to use 3,7G ;-)
[14:39] <BTCOxygen> then go with the kernal lordievader mentioned
[14:39] <BTCOxygen> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[14:40] <FlashDeluxe> yup, i will try it
[14:40] <BTCOxygen> ok, please let us know once you try it
[14:40] <lordievader> Research the PAE kernel first though.
=== Vito is now known as DramaKing
[14:40] <lordievader> I don't know what the consequenses are of that kernel, what is different, etc..
=== DramaKing is now known as Vito
[14:43] <BluesKaj> I'm using 3g RAM , and haven't seen the swap used yet
[14:43] <BluesKaj> BTCOxygen, I think you won't see much difference at all between what is sen and 4G
[14:43] <BluesKaj> seen
[14:44] <lordievader> That is what I thought.
[14:46] <FlashDeluxe> my swap is used, 266M thats why i asked ;) I will reboot and see whats happening
[14:53] <BTCOxygen> I am running 64-bit of Kubuntu
[14:53] <BTCOxygen> So, no swap problems
[14:54] <BluesKaj> sorr BTCOxygen my suggestion should have been directed to flashdeluxe

[17:40] <phalgun> Hello! When I try to install libiodbc2 using apt-get, I'm prompted to remove about 360mb of KDE applications
[17:40] <phalgun> http://paste.kde.org/648776/
[17:41] <phalgun> Any idea on what I'm doing wrong?
[17:48] <Torch> phalgun: my guess, it conflicts with anything that akonadi needs and thus removes akonadi, thus removing most of KDE
[17:48] <shadeslayer> you don't want libiodbc2
[17:48] <shadeslayer> iirc we switched to unixodbc-dev
[17:48] <shadeslayer> and everything is linked to unixodbc
[17:49] <shadeslayer> which conflicts with libiodbc2
[17:49] <phalgun> shadeslayer: i have unixodbc installed already
[17:49] <phalgun> libiodbc2 is required by soprano and hence nepomuk
[17:49] <shadeslayer> not really, you can build soprano with unixodbc
[17:50] <shadeslayer> you just need to patch it
[17:50] <shadeslayer> phalgun: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/raring/soprano/raring/view/head:/debian/patches/no-odbc-dm
[17:51] <shadeslayer> just download and apply that
[17:52] <shadeslayer> phalgun: so, why are you building soprano/nepomuk from source?
[17:52] <phalgun> shadeslayer: working on the audio metadata support for nepomuk-core
[17:52] <shadeslayer> I see
[17:53] <shadeslayer> won't it be beneficial to just install project-neon and only compile nepomuk-core ?
[17:53] <shadeslayer> less time spent on compiling and more time spent on coding
[17:54] <phalgun> never used project-neon before. will give it a try if the patch doesn't work
[17:54] <shadeslayer> okay :)
[17:56] <shadeslayer> the fun bit is that I don't have to worry about deps and compiling everything from scratch, I just clone a project foo, do a simple : sudo apt-get build-dep project-neon-foo , and I'm all set
[17:57] <phalgun> shadeslayer: that is all? There should be a catch somewhere
[17:57] <shadeslayer> nope
[17:57] <shadeslayer> that really is all
[17:57] <shadeslayer> it even has scripts like neonmake which will auto set all cmake variables so that things are picked from /opt/project-neon
[17:57] <shadeslayer> !neon
[17:57] <ubottu> Project Neon provides set of daily builds of KDE and releated modules | See https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/ProjectNeon | More support in #project-neon
[17:58] <shadeslayer> I offload all my builds to launchpad :P
[18:01] <phalgun> shadeslayer: the patch you gave me is for soprano 2.7.5
[18:01] <phalgun> guess it needs changes for 2.9.0
[18:01] <shadeslayer> should apply just fine to master?
[18:03] <phalgun> shadeslayer: the patch worked fine. but soprano still says it needs libiodbc
[18:04] <shadeslayer> !find lib/odbc/virtodbc_r.so
[18:04] <ubottu> File lib/odbc/virtodbc_r.so found in libvirtodbc0
[18:04] <shadeslayer> phalgun: have you done : sudo apt-get build-dep soprano ?
[18:05] <phalgun> shadeslayer: have not.. was trying your build-dep for nepomuk-core directly
[18:05] <shadeslayer> well ... since you're also building soprano, you need to do : sudo apt-get build-dep soprano
[18:07] <phalgun> heh, i was expecting it to do a recursive dependency installation.
[18:07] <shadeslayer> hah, no
[18:07] <shadeslayer> if it were to do that, you'd end up installing alot of things
=== pjoe_dj is now known as pjoe_afk

[19:16] <MattRac> Hi everybody,
[19:16] <MattRac> Hope I can find some help here.
[19:16] <MattRac> To day, I upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04. At the end of the upgrade, there is a big list of packages that are proposed for removal. But it said it can take several hours to remove.
[19:16] <MattRac> I chosen to keep them but I'm facing some issues and I find removing these packages could help. Is there a log where I can find the list of this packages that were proposed for removal ?
[19:16] <MattRac> Thanks for help. ;-)
[19:16] <FloodBotK1> MattRac: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[19:17] <shadeslayer> MattRac: have a look in /var/log
[19:17] <shadeslayer> it should have an upgrade log
[19:18] <shadeslayer> and in the upgrade log you should be able to find the packges it wanted to remove
[19:18] <MattRac> shadeslayer: I thought about /var/log/dist-upgrade/... but didn't find a clear list inside ;-)
[19:19] <shadeslayer> hmm
[19:19] <shadeslayer> MattRac: just run sudo apt-get autoremove
[19:19] <shadeslayer> and it should remove orphaned packages
[19:20] <MattRac> shadeslayer: Don't work because they aren't orphans ;-)
[19:20] <MattRac> Just useless :-)
[19:21] <shadeslayer> dunno then xD
