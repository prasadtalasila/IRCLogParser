[06:37] <infinity> tjaalton: I got it like ten times yesterday. :/
[07:32] <tjaalton> infinity: well there's things to try on that bug
[07:38] <infinity> tjaalton: With a nasty performance and power draw hit, apparently.  I'm not sure it's worth the effort.  I can live with the lockups.

[07:45] <infinity> tjaalton: No, I will be after a reboot, but can't reboot just now.

[08:55] <mitya57> infinity: I'm in ubuntu-bug-control
[08:55] <mitya57> and I was able to access that site in the past
[08:56] <infinity> mitya57: I think it was further locked down, pending review of data privacy laws and other such madness.
[08:56] <infinity> mitya57: When you log in, is there a more info expander or something that shows you that it's looking for a group you're not in?
[08:56] <mitya57> no, nothing like that
[08:57] <infinity> If I could remember how to log OUT of an SSO service...
[08:57] <infinity> I guess I could just log out of login.launchpad.net entirely.
[08:57] <mitya57> IIRC there was a "log out" link at the page bottom
[08:57] <infinity> Oh, which doesn't do anything. :P
[08:58] <infinity> No log out links on errors once logged in, no.
[08:59] <mitya57> https://login.ubuntu.com/+logout ?
[08:59] <infinity> That didn't actually log me out of errors.

[09:00] <infinity> ^-- Yeah, it's looking for that right now.
[09:01] <infinity> We're hoping to be able to open it up a bit more in the future, AFAIK, but it's a bit messy.
[09:01] <infinity> mitya57: ev might know more about progress on that front.
[09:02]  * mitya57 hopes it's possible to open it at least for ~ubuntu-dev
[09:03] <infinity> I'd probably be happy even with just core-dev, but anything that isn't "just the company" gives lawyers heart attacks when it comes to users sending us data that could be, well, anything.
[09:03] <infinity> (And rightfully so, I suppose)

[13:29] <xnox> bdmurray: you are a rock star @ finding the right set of options that trigger above more often than others.
[13:29] <pitti> xnox: I haven't seen this, but it's obviously passing a NULL argument to that function?
[13:30] <xnox> yeap. the function accepts dbuswatch pointer, it's passed NULL and it tries to do two simple assignments NULL->fd=-1 and something else. which causes SIGSEGV
[13:31] <xnox> I don't see how in high level python/dbus it could be causing this deliberately. the clean up looks racy to me.

[14:49] <dbarth> hey, i have an apparmor, pam and lightdm question
[14:50] <xnox> go on =) sounds interesting so far.
[14:50] <dbarth> setuid is failing in a lightdm child process and i'm not sure if that's really not normal, or if it's just an apparmor file that is missing
[14:51] <mdeslaur> dbarth: do you have an apparmor denial in dmesg?
[14:51] <dbarth> mdeslaur: not that i can see though
[14:51] <mdeslaur> dbarth: then it's unlikely to be apparmor the problem
[14:52] <dbarth> does it go in auth.log or syslog by default?
=== Tonio__ is now known as Tonio_
[14:52] <mdeslaur> dbarth: syslog unless you have the "audit" package installed
[14:53] <dbarth> hmm, let me check that maybe first
[14:53] <mdeslaur> s/audit/auditd/
[14:54] <mdeslaur> if you have that package installed, it goes to /var/log/audit* somewhere
[14:54] <mdeslaur> (can't recall off-hand)
[14:54] <dbarth> no audit here
[14:54] <dbarth> and nothing from the lightdm process in syslog
[14:55] <dbarth> i will go through lightdm.log again
[14:59] <mterry> bdmurray, remember you talked to me a bit ago about the two duplicity SRUs in quantal?  you haven't accepted the other duplicity yet.  Would it be wasting your review cycles to upload another duplicity to quantal that combined both uploads?
[15:00] <dbarth> mdeslaur: i can see some old denial messages for the freerdp session though (in kern.log)
[15:00] <dbarth> but that was fixed once the config. file for the wrapper executable was installed
[15:01] <dbarth> (for the 12.10 release)
[15:01] <mdeslaur> dbarth: ok, but if there's nothing newer, then your issue is probably elsewhere
[15:01] <mdeslaur> all denials should be logged
[15:02] <jdstrand> it goes to kern.log
[15:02] <jdstrand> lightdm itself is not confined
[15:02] <jdstrand> the guest session is
[15:03] <ogra_> if lightdm already habnded over to the session manager if your issue happens, the errors would be in ~/.xsession-errors of teh user btw
[15:03] <mdeslaur> oh, whoops, yes, kern.log
[15:03] <dbarth> mdeslaur: ok, i'll dig deeper; thanks for pushing me further at least
[15:03] <jdstrand> we don't have any explicit denials that would block setuid
[15:03] <jdstrand> (even in the guest session)
[15:04] <mdeslaur> dbarth: check kern.log first though
[15:05] <dbarth> ogra_: the session opens fine if i make the pam session layer optional
[15:05] <hallyn> zul: infinity: is the raring qemu upload still waiting for review, or is it hanging on something else I forgot?  (it was waiting on ipxe-qemu for awhile...)
[15:05] <dbarth> the issue is when i re-enable the pam session part, to inject creds in the session
[15:05] <hallyn> i'm just confused bc i still don't see it on the uploads page for qemu
[15:06] <dbarth> jdstrand: ok, noted
[15:08] <hallyn> (oh, i do see it in the NEW queue)
[15:15] <zul> mterry:  can we get alembic looked at today as well please?

[16:35] <roadmr> is there a way to tell the installer not to "inherit" those grub parameters? it properly ignored e.g. automatic-ubiquity but kept e.g. url, initrd, nfsroot and log_host

[16:38] <bdmurray> mterry: okay, thanks

[17:19] <seb128> iBelieve, ubuntu: is the packaging branch
[17:19] <seb128> lp:apport is the upstream project branch
[17:19] <seb128> that's less obvious when upstream is on launchpad

[22:53] <tjaalton> so on raring I have four separate dnsmasq's running, one of which should enable virbr0 for libvirt, but it can't create the socket for it
[22:53] <tjaalton> this was supposed to be fixed ages ago, I think
[22:54] <slangasek> I haven't had any problems with multiple dnsmasqs running
[22:54] <slangasek> the nm one should be bound to a different interface than the virbr0 one
[22:59] <tjaalton> so there's one for lxc, libvirt, nm, and one system-wide?
[23:00] <tjaalton> seems as if it's running one extra
[23:14] <tjaalton> eh, I had both dnsmasq and dnsmasq-base installed for some reason
[23:19] <tjaalton> now it should work, but virtbr0 still doesn't have an address
[23:50] <tjaalton> stopping libvirt-bin probably should stop it's dnsmasq too
