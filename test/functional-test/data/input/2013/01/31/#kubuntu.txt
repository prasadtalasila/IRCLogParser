[10:12] <naggappan> hi how to change the language for gedit
[10:12] <naggappan> say example right now i have english
[10:12] <naggappan> and i have to launch gedit with french language
[10:12] <naggappan> i tried
[10:12] <naggappan> LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8 gedit
[10:12] <naggappan> but it is still opeingin in english
[10:15] <lordievader> naggappan: Not sure on this at all, but don't you need to export the LANG variable, so your command will be: export LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8; gedit
[10:19] <apachelogger> lordievader: export is permanent to the current shell, not using export is limited to the command following
[10:20] <apachelogger> export LANG=foo; gedit; kate; <- LANG will be foo for both gedit and kate
[10:20] <apachelogger> LANG=foo gedit; kate; <- LANG will be foo for gedit and something else for kate
[10:20] <apachelogger> works that way with all envirionment variables
[10:21] <apachelogger> naggappan: I suggest you ask in #ubuntu as they know more about gnome applications

[10:58] <devmark> hi

[11:02] <devmark> what is /dev/sda is this my C /Windows? And what is /dev/sdb?
[11:03] <devmark> i cant resize my hard drive why?
[11:04] <hateball> !install
[11:04] <ubottu> Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall - Don't want to use a CD? See http://tinyurl.com/3exghs - See also !automate
[11:05] <hateball> devmark: Usually it's best to resize your windows partitions from inside windows before installing Kubuntu alongside
[11:05] <devmark> hateball: can I not resize it in Kubuntu?
[11:05] <hateball> devmark: At your own risk
[11:06] <hateball> Sometimes the installer itself behaves... strangely. So it's better to prepare the partitions first
[11:06] <devmark> hateball: i try to. but it says: "Unable to detect the filesystem"
[11:08] <hateball> devmark: Which version of Windows is this? Perhaps it was not cleanly unmounted
[11:08] <devmark> hateball: win 7
[11:09] <hateball> I'm not sure if resizing using gparted or such will have undesirable effects on Win7 booting afterwards.... perhaps someone else knows better
[11:09]  * hateball does not dualboot
[11:10] <devmark> i cant still not resize it :S
[11:10] <devmark> brb
[11:16] <devmark> still "damage"
[11:16] <devmark> cant resize it
[11:17] <devmark> why?
[11:17] <devmark> I remember it working before
[11:20] <devmark> how  can my win partition be mounted? if i run live cd linux?
[11:20] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[11:23] <BluesKaj> devmark , sudo mount /dev/sdX, X being the windows assigned number
[11:25] <devmark> BluesKaj: What does that command do?
[11:28] <BluesKaj> devmark, it mounts your windows partition
[11:30] <devmark> i didnt
[11:30] <devmark> mount: can't find /dev/sda2 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[11:32] <devmark> wtf i really like kubuntu. please help me install it :S
[11:33] <shadeslayer> erm
[11:33] <shadeslayer> you can resize the partition from inside the installer
[11:34] <devmark> shadeslayer: I dont think so. Why does gparted says "damaged parition"
[11:34] <devmark> I cant resize windows partition
[11:35] <shadeslayer> I don't know why it would say damaged partition, but when you launch the installer, you can tell the installer how much size Kubuntu should use and it'll resize the windows partition automatically
[11:36] <BluesKaj> shadeslayer, he's trying to resize with gparted not ubiquity
[11:36] <tsimpson> I'd suggest you should try running a disk check and defragmentation from within windows, see if that helps
[11:36] <shadeslayer> but why?
[11:37] <devmark> tsimpson: should i run win7 and try to shrink the partition?
[11:37] <BluesKaj> devmark, you have use the kubuntu install phase to properly resize windows
[11:37] <devmark> maybe this has something to do with my encryption? I using Whole System encryption on my win 7 system disk
[11:37] <tsimpson> devmark: run the check and defragment in windows, then see if the kubuntu installer can resize the partition
[11:38] <devmark> Truecrypt
[11:38] <shadeslayer> mmm .. that's going to be an issue I think
[11:38] <BluesKaj> easybcd can be used in windows to resize the partition as well , devmark
[11:39] <BluesKaj> oh , now he tells us
[11:40] <devmark> hm so there is a problem with encryption?
[11:40] <BluesKaj> it's very likely
[11:42] <devmark> so what should I do? if I run encryption?
[11:42] <devmark> okay, gonna try resize it from windows
[11:42] <devmark> brb
[11:53] <BluesKaj> well. so far most info on truecrypt indicates they're not resizable
[11:57] <devmark> hi
[11:57] <devmark> gonna try now
[11:57] <devmark> gonna try now
[11:59] <devmark> okay. now i have resized the hard drive
[11:59] <devmark> should I use the new parition as Primary or as Logical type?
[12:00] <devmark> while install Kubuntu
[12:00] <BluesKaj> devmark, I don't think it's possible without losing your data
[12:00] <devmark> BluesKaj: why not? I already did it. Should I use the partition as Primary or as Logical type?
[12:01] <hateball> devmark: doesnt really matter, but if you plan to partition it further you'd want to make it logical
[12:01] <BluesKaj> http://www.experts123.com/q/can-i-resize-a-truecrypt-partition.html . deb
[12:01] <hateball> if you already have windows on there you have at minimum 2 partitions already, and 4 is the max for logical ones so
[12:01] <BluesKaj> devmark, ^
[12:02] <hateball> ugh, I mean primary
[12:02] <devmark> hateball: whats diffrent between logical and primary?
[12:03] <hateball> devmark: that a logical can contain several more logical ones
[12:03] <BluesKaj> hateball, his partition is truecrypted ...resizing a nono
[12:03] <tsimpson> a logical partition is inside a primary partition
[12:03] <hateball> BluesKaj: He's already sorted that, this is another issue
[12:04] <hateball> my brain for some reason cannot type primary and logical where they need to be. tsimpson is right
[12:04] <devmark> hateball: so i should use Primary right?
[12:05] <BluesKaj> it'd not unless he has a freespace partition beyond the encryptrf partition
[12:05] <BluesKaj> ok , I'll back off ..good luck
[12:05] <tsimpson> for windows, I think it (still) requires it's system partition to be the first primary partition, linux doesn't care
[12:06] <devmark> tsimpson: but I think I gonna use "Primary". So the Bootloader found linux in list?
[12:06] <devmark> caouse I heard "Logical" is only for data storage
[12:06] <tsimpson> devmark: the bootloader isn't located on a partition, it's written to the master boot record of the disk
[12:06] <devmark> tsimpson: so can I use Primary? would it make any big diffrents?
[12:07] <tsimpson> logical vs primary has nothing to do with "data storage"
[12:07] <tsimpson> except that a HDD is only for data storage ;)
[12:07] <tsimpson> you can use either, for linux is makes no difference whatsoever
[12:08] <tsimpson> I'd personally choose logical, as to not be limited to the maximum of 4
[12:08] <tsimpson> and I'd recommend a separate partition for /home, but it's not a requirement
[12:09] <devmark> tsimpson: and what about "Mount point". Should I choice "/boot" here?
[12:09] <tsimpson> you should have / for the root, don't bother creating one for /boot
[12:10] <devmark> tsimpsons: I dont understand. What do "Mount point" does?
[12:11] <devmark> tsimpson: cant find any /root
[12:12] <devmark> I just found /boot /home /user
[12:13] <hateball> devmark:  / is root of the filesystem
[12:13] <hateball> so it should just be listed as /
[12:14] <tsimpson> devmark: in Windows, partitions are "mounted" as "drives" C:\ D:\ E:\ etc, in Linux there is one root /, and everything is mounted (placed) to some path inside that root
[12:15] <tsimpson> so the first partition can be for /, the second for /home, etc
[12:17] <invariant> Do you think it is a good thing that such users use Kubuntu?
[12:18] <invariant> I personally think such people should first learn the basics of UNIX, because KDE cannot isolate them completely from such subjects.
[12:19] <invariant> A well-configured tablet interface might not require any such knowledge, but as soon as you allow a file manager people will have to be able to understand how it works.
[12:20] <tsimpson> how are people to learn if they don't use the system
[12:23] <devmark> how can i encrypt my kubuntu partition after install?
[12:24] <tsimpson> the installer should give you the option to encrypt during the install process
[12:25] <devmark> i know but if i missed it?
[12:26] <devmark> brb
[12:29] <devmark> okay. now the install is done
[12:30] <devmark> but now it messed up with bootloader? there is no bootloader. it boot from kubuntu directly
[12:30] <devmark> how can I fix bootloader?
[12:30] <fabricio> hi, i need help
[12:30] <fabricio> someone can help me?
[12:30] <tsimpson> devmark: there is a bootloader, you just need to press and hold shift during boot to see the menu

[12:43] <devmark> tsimpson: is there any diffrent if I do not using "Swap" for linux?
[12:44] <tsimpson> devmark: swap is used as an extension to RAM, it's also used if you ever want to hibernate the system
[12:47] <devmark> tsimpson: so should i use it?
[12:47] <tsimpson> devmark: it is recommended to use swap, yes
[12:47] <devmark> maybe i should reformat my whole hard drive and install this correct, with "Swap" etc etc?
[12:47] <tsimpson> it's up to you, you can also use a file as a swap space, like windows does
[12:48] <devmark> tsimpson: how can I fix "swap" now? When I already have installed Kubuntu?
[12:49] <tsimpson> you can create an empty file on the system and use it as swap
[12:49] <devmark> tsimpson: how do i do that?
[12:51] <tsimpson> devmark: have a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#How_do_I_add_more_swap.3F
[12:51] <tsimpson> it should give you instructions for creating a swap file
[13:03] <devmark> after running dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile \
[13:03] <devmark> i cant find the swapfile?
[13:03] <tsimpson> devmark: it'll be /swapfile
[13:03] <devmark> what is wrong? I just follow the guide http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleIOw7rXf8
[13:04] <devmark> cant find it in list

[13:17] <BluesKaj> in konverstaion settings, configure konverstaion , emrahnzm
[13:17] <shadeslayer> secure boot != encryption
[13:17] <emrahnzm> BluesKaj: i think fonts are not problem
[13:17] <devmark> shadeslayer: how?
[13:17] <emrahnzm> something else
[13:17] <shadeslayer> secure boot will check if the bootloader was signed
[13:17] <shadeslayer> and the signed bootloader can only load signed binaries
[13:17] <BluesKaj> emrahnzm, then dpi and anti-aliasing perhaps
[13:17] <shadeslayer> so something could be loading unsigned binaries

[13:24] <BluesKaj> devmark, is encryption really necessary ?
[13:25] <devmark> BluesKaj: why not?
[13:26] <devmark> the question is, will it work after?
[13:27] <devmark> why does it not work? is it becouse of Truecrypt Boot loader?
[13:27] <BluesKaj> no thequestion not why not , the question is why ...encryption unless absolutely necessary creates more problems than they're worth if you're going to partitionong and trying different OSs
[13:27] <BluesKaj> to do partitions
[13:28] <BluesKaj> who gave you the idea that you needed to encrypt or is this necessary due to workplace policies

[13:50] <drdozer> hi - I've plugged my samsung s3 into my ubuntu box, and a notification baloon popped up, but I can't see it in dolphin
[13:50] <drdozer> is there something I need to install?
[13:55] <Torch> drdozer: it has ICS or jelly bean, i assume?
[13:55] <drdozer> jelly bean I think
[13:56] <drdozer> I was hoping that it would just appear as another device, like USB drives do
[13:56] <Torch> drdozer: google decided in their ultimate wisdom to remove mass storage access in ICS (and don't plan to bring it back), so it's not as easy any more
[13:56] <Torch> drdozer: you need mtp (a microsoft protocol) to access it
[13:57] <drdozer> Torch: mm, that is not nice - for once this all works out of the box on my windows laptop but fails on my kubuntu desktop
[13:57] <Torch> drdozer: kde has a kio_mtp plugin, but it's not working very well
[13:57] <Torch> drdozer: workaround is to install an ftp (or ssh) server on the phone and use that
[13:58] <Torch> drdozer: or use adb if you're a dev anyway ;-)
[13:58] <Husar> Hi, i trying to connect my Nikon camera as MassStorage,  and get "hub 6-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 2" (it was working 2weeks ago :() - fix from google do not work
[14:01] <Torch> drdozer: kio_mtp is probably being worked on, but i have no idea what the current state is.
[14:01] <drdozer> Torch: thanks - for now I will just use my laptop :(
[14:03] <contrast> kio-mtp has already been released. There's actually a PPA for it.
[14:03] <Torch> contrast: well, i have it. it's just not working very well.
[14:04] <contrast> Torch: Ohh I see... I just used it recently to put some stuff on a friend's Kindle without issue.
[14:08] <drdozer> ok, now that I have kio_mtp installed, when I plug in my s3 it pops up the option to "open with file manage" that wasn't there before, but nothing useful happens
[14:08] <drdozer> oh well
[14:09] <Torch> drdozer: it sometimes works, iirc
[14:09] <devmark> whats the name of "diskpart" in linux?
[14:09] <Torch> devmark: what do you mean?
[14:09] <devmark> how do i make my usb flush boot with win 7? should I just download .iso and move it  to usb flush? or do I need any format?
[14:10] <Torch> devmark: you want to make a bootable usb stick from a kubuntu iso?
[14:11] <devmark> Torch: yes, from kubuntu, but not kubutu i already got it =)
[14:11] <Torch> devmark: there's usb-creator-kde on my (12.04) system for that
[14:11] <Torch> devmark: check if you have that
[14:12] <contrast> I think he means he wants to put a Windows 7 ISO onto a USB drive from within Kubuntu...
[14:12] <devmark> ooo i see thanks!
[14:12] <contrast> Right, devmark?
[14:12] <devmark> contrast: yes
[14:12] <contrast> usb-creator is only for Ubuntu-based ISOs...
[14:12] <devmark> hmhh
[14:12] <contrast> devmark: You can dry dd, it's command-line only...
[14:13] <Torch> question is if the usb stick is supposed to boot
[14:13] <Torch> afaik it won't be bootable when you just dd an iso.
[14:13] <contrast> devmark: It will wipe your flash drive though, so make sure you back up anything that's on it...
[14:13] <Torch> but i might be wrong about that
[14:13] <contrast> Torch: Pretty sure you are. :)
[14:14] <devmark> contrast: what do you mean by "dry dd"?
[14:15] <devmark> should i just move the .iso file to usb flush? without format it?

[14:15] <contrast> devmark: No, that won't make it bootable
[14:15] <devmark> should I just type "dd" in terminal?
[14:16] <contrast> devmark: sudo dd if=/path/to/windows7.iso of=/dev/sdXY (where X is the drive and Y is the partition - Partition Manager under Applications -> System is probably the best way of figuring out the drive letter and partition manager you want to dump to)
[14:16] <devmark> ty
[14:17] <contrast> No problem, good luck

[15:56] <devmark> hi, dd didnt work for my windows.iso
[15:56] <devmark> :S
[15:56] <devmark> it doesnt boot
[15:56] <devmark> how can i make my usb flush win bootable truth kubuntu?
[15:57] <shadeslayer> hmm ... I remember doing this, but it was via windows
[15:57] <devmark> i know how do to it via win, u can use diskpart
[15:57] <shadeslayer> some utility ... don't remember the name
[15:58] <shadeslayer> but afaik there's no way to do it via Linux
[15:58] <shadeslayer> i.e create a windows bootable usb via linux
[15:58] <devmark> u joke? it must be
[15:58] <shadeslayer> nope, I distinctly remember trying out alot of things
[15:58] <shadeslayer> and nothing worked
[15:58] <james147> shadeslayer: I have done it from linux before, trying to find the tool i used now...
[15:59] <devmark> iam stucked
[15:59] <devmark> in the linux matrix :P
[15:59] <shadeslayer> james147: okay, it's just that I tried it with W7 a couple of months earlier
[15:59] <shadeslayer> and it didn't work
[15:59] <devmark> james147: please find it dude..
[15:59] <james147> shadeslayer: yeah, i spent a while on the internet before I found a solution that worked
[15:59] <devmark> but i really love irssi :DD
[15:59] <shadeslayer> heh
[16:00] <devmark> shit i really missed this client
[16:00] <shadeslayer> iirc there was a tool that was said to work, but it didn't work for me
=== spawnie is now known as spawn[dead]
[16:00] <james147> devmark: ahh yesm it was: format the drive as ntfs, copy the contents of the iso to the usb, then run `ms-sys -7 /dev/sdX` to install the bootloader to it
[16:01] <james147> it worked with win7 when I tried it
[16:02] <james147> (fyi, this was the post: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/creating-windows-7-bootable-usb-from-linux-762229/#post3946086 )
[16:03] <james147> apperantly unetbootin is also ment to work, but I never liked that program much
[16:05] <james147> o yeah, and make sure you mark the partition as bootable
[16:06] <BluesKaj> ...BBL
[16:18] <contrast> devmark: Check to make sure the partition on the USB drive has the "bootable" flag set (you can do that in Partition Manager).

[16:42] <linuxfreaker> http://tracker.webtechnologyfocused.com.au/ehw/volumesnotdetected.jpg
[16:42] <linuxfreaker> When I try to install ubuntu 12.04. The installation cannot see the SAN storage device as shown http://tracker.webtechnologyfocused.com.au/ehw/volumesnotdetected.jpg
[16:42] <linuxfreaker> I believe this could be a driver issue with Ubuntu and may need the driver to see the storage device.
[16:48] <shadeslayer> linuxfreaker: errr ... that doesn't look like a question pertaining to Kubuntu
[16:48] <shadeslayer> seems like a question suited for #ubuntu-server
[16:57] <devmark> how do i just "simply" move .iso to usb flush?

[16:57] <mr0wl> hey, what's this appmenu update i got ?
[16:57] <mr0wl> is it the same appmenu feature coming in KDE 4.10?
[17:01] <james147> devmark: the contents of the iso? or the iso itself?
[17:01] <devmark> iso itself
[17:03] <james147> devmark: umm, then just copy and paste in dolphin... if this is for the windows iso, then you probally want to be copying the conents...
[17:04] <devmark> james147: james147: it says "no access"
[17:04] <devmark> to do that
[17:07] <james147> devmark: what filesystem does the usb have? what premissions does the drive have? The output of `mount` and `ls -la /media/` (or the path to the mount point) would be helpful !pastebin

[21:23] <invariant> How do  I make a microphone work in Skype in Kubuntu? It works when I run it on Ubuntu (both 12.04) on another machine.
[21:23] <yofel> possibly pulseaudio is getting in the way, try looking at pavucontrol if it's muted
[21:24] <invariant> yofel, how can I see what audio signals are available and which ones are turned on from an authorative source?
[21:25] <yofel> well, pavucontrol will show which devices are there and in what state
[21:25] <yofel> kwin should do it too, but esp. with microphones I found pavucontrol to be a more reliable source of information
[21:30] <invariant> yofel, how can I test it independent of Skype?
=== kubuntu is now known as Guest29709
[21:36] <invariant> I am pressing 'make a test sound' in Skype, but nothing happens.
[21:36] <invariant> Other audio applications work fine.
[21:37] <yofel> hm, maybe make sure that the right audio device is selected...
[21:38] <yofel> I don't have skype on *this* system, so it's a bit hard to figure out...
[21:38] <yofel> pavucontrol has a volume meter for input devices for testing if the microphone at least works
[21:38] <yofel> and if skype is set to use pulseaudio it should work I think
[21:38] <invariant> yofel, I cannot select an audio device, because it only shows pulse audio as an option.
[21:38] <yofel> yeah, that should be right
[21:41] <invariant> systemsettings returns Qt: Session management error: Could not open network socket
[21:43] <petersaints> Hi guys. Kamoso doesn't start my webcam. However Skype does. Strange isn't it? Also (in Skype) my webcam is upside down. It's a webcam integrated into the laptop. On Windows, without the proper drivers, it also displays upside down. Any ideas on how to fix these webcam problems?
[21:45] <invariant> yofel:even for Firefox, I get: Client failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon
[21:46] <yofel> that's... weird
[22:02] <petersaints> The error I get when I open Kamoso from the console is
