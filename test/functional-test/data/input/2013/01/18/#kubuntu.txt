[00:05] <calavera> Hello?
[00:06] <musca> Hello calavera
[00:06] <calavera> Hello.
[00:06] <calavera> Would you be able to help me with my problem?
[00:07] <musca> may be
[00:10] <calavera> Well, I'm having trouble where GRUB can't see my NTFS drive
[00:10] <calavera> When it tries to boot, it gives me an invalid file path error.
[00:10] <musca> well, uefi systems use a GUID partition table
[00:10] <calavera> What does that mean?
[00:11] <musca> only systems booted in uefi mode see the existing partitions
[00:12] <musca> systems booted in BIOS mode see a MBR with an entry that claims the full capacity (no free space left)
[00:13] <musca> a fake MBR that is
[00:14] <musca> if your existing Win7 is an uefi system you will have to boot your linux install media in uefi mode
[00:17] <musca> your media must contain some special efi files
[00:22] <calavera> So are you saying that I should just reinstall *buntu?
[00:23] <musca> i dunno what your problem is, what you did before, what you want to do, and so on
[00:24] <calavera> I have two hard drives in my laptop with W7 as my primary.
[00:24] <calavera> I want to dual boot across both of them using GRUB, if possible.
[00:24] <calavera> The UEFI system is making that hard.
[00:25] <calavera> Every time that I want to boot into Windows, GRUB tells me that there is an invalid file path.
[00:26] <musca> this is quite new stuff for me and i don't know if there is a workaround
[00:27] <musca> How do you boot your windows now?
[00:29] <musca> perhaps you can create an entry for grub in your windows boot manager
[00:29] <calavera> I am booting Windows using the MBR. I eventually got tired of messing with it, and I just let MBR overwrite GRUB, and then I just let GNU/ Linux just sit on there.
[00:32] <musca> hmm, did you try to find some howto on the inet?
[00:32] <musca> http://askubuntu.com/questions/193144/dual-boot-uefi-windows-7-and-ubuntu-12-04-both-64-bits-w7-entry-doesnt-appea
[00:59] <BarkingFish> sorry about that - I completely forgot to come back here after I rebooted :P  I guess old age is catching up with me!
[00:59] <BarkingFish> Right - I disabled the desktop items, turned off Folder view and did everything humanly possible to knobble kio_thumbnail, but it came back when I rebooted.
[01:00] <BarkingFish> Looks like FlowRiser has left - yofel, any other ideas?
[01:01] <BarkingFish> I tried strace against the process when I could get into a terminal, and it just sat there.  Did nothing even while kio_thumbnail was slowing my kit down to practically 0% usage
[01:01] <BarkingFish> *usage/usability
[01:02] <dabauer> What printer do I use with Ubuntu???
[01:03] <BarkingFish> !printers
[01:03] <ubottu> Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu
[01:03] <dabauer> OK, CUPS I'll use but with what printer???
[01:04] <BarkingFish> there should be a list in there of all those compatible with cups, dabauer
[01:04] <dabauer> OK, let me go look
[01:04] <BarkingFish> if you read the page about Hardware Support Components that should be it
[01:19] <morgajel> dabauer: printer support is pretty good at this point; most drivers are 95%+ complete, and just lack the features that otherwise require manufacturer apps to use.
[01:32] <dabauer> just bought a printer from thinkpenguin, an HP printer, should work OK.
[02:08] <juacom99> hi, one question, i'm on Kubuntu 12.04 LTS and every time i start my computer i get an crash error regarding lsb_release. I saw the bug track but they don't say enithing about a solution for this bug. any idea if is posible to solve it and how?
[02:09] <BarkingFish> juacom99, Hi.  Do you have the link to the bug please?
[02:10] <TheLordOfTime> as an aside, by the way, Kubuntu 12.04 is not LTS.  Only Ubuntu (the Unity ubuntu) has the LTS title :P{
[02:10] <TheLordOfTime> sorry, i'm just a stickler for accuracy :p
[02:11] <BarkingFish> I certainly know there's no bug as far as I am aware in 12.10 - i've been on it since it came out and never seen one.  Come to think of it, i never saw one on 12.04 either
[02:11] <juacom99> BarkingFish: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1094218
[02:11] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1094218 in lsb (Ubuntu) "lsb_release crashed with IOError in getstatusoutput(): [Errno 10] No child processes" [Medium,Confirmed]
[02:11] <BarkingFish> TheLordOfTime, I'm sorry, you're wrong.
[02:11] <BarkingFish> http://www.kubuntu.org/news/12.04-release
[02:12] <TheLordOfTime> BarkingFish, really?  I was told differently by the release team
[02:12] <TheLordOfTime> and the dev team
[02:12] <BarkingFish> if you're a stickler for accuracy, please ensure you're accurate
[02:12] <TheLordOfTime> hell even been called out here about it too
[02:12] <BarkingFish> nope
[02:13] <juacom99> it seeams is a pyton script calling lsb_release
[02:13] <juacom99> that crash
[02:13] <BarkingFish> yeah - it was only reported a week or two back, juacom99
[02:13]  * TheLordOfTime shrugs
[02:13] <BarkingFish> it might take a while to figure out how to resolve it
[02:14] <juacom99> ok thanks
[02:14] <BarkingFish> in the mean time, as I say - you have the option of upgrading to 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal)
[02:14] <TheLordOfTime> BarkingFish, when i hear someone on the core dev team tell me this (and by core i mean the team that devs the things all flavors are dependent on), i'll believe you, until then, you and i can argue.
[02:14] <BarkingFish> and I know there's no errors in that
[02:14] <BarkingFish> TheLordOfTime, when it's on Kubuntu's own website, it isn't wrong.
[02:14] <TheLordOfTime> i'm here actyually to figure out what the KDE runtime package is, so i can install KDE without all the Kubuntu applications
[02:14] <BarkingFish> It wouldn't get pulished otherwise
[02:15] <BarkingFish> *published
[02:15] <juacom99> BarkingFish: is really mature 12.10 at this point?
[02:15] <BarkingFish> juacom99, it's quite mature, yes - we go to 13.04 in 3 months time
[02:16] <juacom99> ok i may make an upgrade then
[02:18] <BarkingFish> juacom99, i'd do that - we're only 3 months away from Raring Racoon coming out, but 12.10 is clean at the moment.
[02:19] <rishubh> i Have rekonq 1.1 version...how can i update it to the latest stable version or latest  developing version?
[02:19] <BarkingFish> rishubh, which version of Kubuntu are you using?
[02:20] <juacom99> BarkingFish: so you say i should wait till 13.04?
[02:20] <BarkingFish> *Raring Ringtail, sorry
[02:20] <BarkingFish> i have raccoons on the brain :)
[02:20] <BarkingFish> No, 12.10 is ok , juacom99
[02:21] <BarkingFish> it just means if you upgrade now, to get past this error - you will need to upgrade again in about 3 months
[02:23] <juacom99> BarkingFish: can you refresh my memory on the command to upgrade version??
[02:24] <BarkingFish> in a terminal, do this:  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[02:27] <BarkingFish> incidentally, is there anyone here who can tell me why kubuntu has rpm software when we don't use rpms?
[02:32] <juacom99> kubuntu don't have rpm software itself, it has a tool to comvert rpm to deb (alien) and then install it in kubuntu..
[02:34] <BarkingFish> ah - i just saw something install called rpm2cpio, and there's other rpm building tools and stuff in here too :)
[02:34] <BarkingFish> anyhoo, i gotta reboot, back in a tick
[02:46] <tekkbuzz> juacom99, wajig converts rpms too!
[02:47] <juacom99> tekkbuzz: neve heard of wajig....
[02:47] <tekkbuzz> juacom99, it's in the repos.
[02:51] <tekkbuzz> wajig - simple and unified package management for Debian
[02:53] <BarkingFish> i'm also trying to figure out how to upgrade to raring ringtail so i can go bug hunting on it
[02:54] <BarkingFish> anyone got any ideas?  I know I have to add something or do something somewhere, but I can't remember what or how
[02:54] <DarthFrog> BarkingFish: do-release-upgrade -d
[02:55] <BarkingFish> aha, thanks :)
[02:57] <juacom99> anyone have any idea on how to backup a partition before make an update?
[02:57] <juacom99> dd but how
[03:00] <tekkbuzz> dd if=/dev/sda1 of=sda1.img ???
[03:02] <juacom99> i don't have to tell the dd the length of the partition or where it start?
[03:02] <tekkbuzz> nope
[03:03] <BarkingFish> morning DarthFrog - thought i'd let you know. not sure what is up, but do-release-upgrade is busted
[03:03] <BarkingFish> http://pastebin.com/C69uLeEN
[03:03] <DarthFrog> Lovely.
[03:03] <rishubh> BarkingFish: 12.10
[03:03] <tekkbuzz> make sure you pick the right partition you want though.
[03:04] <juacom99> i got 2 disks with 3 partition each one it gonna be a hard call :P
[03:04] <juacom99> but i think i know witch is the right one
[03:05] <tekkbuzz> cat /proc/partitions
[03:05] <BarkingFish> rishubh, if you put through updates on kubuntu, whatever you have now is the stable version.
[03:05] <rishubh> sorry but i didnt get u
[03:06] <rishubh> do i already have all updated version?
[03:06] <BarkingFish> yes
[03:06] <BarkingFish> when you do updates you get the latest version available
[03:06] <rishubh> but my rekonq is 1.1 version
[03:06] <rishubh> and thats not latest
[03:07] <BarkingFish> actually, it's the latest one we have
[03:07] <BarkingFish> open up a terminal and type: apt-cache policy rekonq
[03:07] <BarkingFish> you will see this: Candidate: 1.1-0ubuntu1
[03:08] <BarkingFish> we may have a proposed version somewhere, but that's the latest stable one we issue
[03:08] <rishubh> ok....
[03:08] <rishubh> but kde has got better ones
[03:08] <rishubh> i mean more updated
[03:09] <BarkingFish> if you want a proposed version, i will tell you how to add the proposed updates to kubuntu
[03:09] <rishubh> ya sure
[03:10] <rishubh> what exactly is  a proposed version?
[03:11] <BarkingFish> it's one we're in the process of getting ready, but which hasn't been generally released
[03:11] <BarkingFish> it's intended pretty much for bug testing :)
[03:12] <BarkingFish> open a terminal, and type: kdesudo software-properties-kde
[03:12] <rishubh> ya and i am doing bug testing..
[03:13] <BarkingFish> when it opens, click the updates tab
[03:13] <rishubh> done
[03:13] <BarkingFish> and tick pre-released updates and (if you're adventurous) unsupported updates
[03:14] <rishubh> ticked both of them
[03:14] <BarkingFish> when you've done this, click close and you'll be told you need to update your sources
[03:14] <BarkingFish> click reload and wait
[03:15] <tekkbuzz> anyone know how kubuntu interacts with xorg.conf, I know it don't need it, but could I write kubuntus config to it somehow then edit it to my liking?
[03:15] <rishubh> wheres reload button its only reset and close
[03:16] <BarkingFish> rishubh - you should see a box telling you your sources are out of date
[03:16] <BarkingFish> the two buttons underneath should be reload and close if you're running in english - how they're worded in other languages, i don't know - it depends on how your system is localized
[03:17] <rishubh> BarkingFish: there are two buttons one is reset and close...thats it
[03:17] <BarkingFish> click close
[03:18] <rishubh> BarkingFish: ok...now it says do you want to reload..
[03:18] <rishubh> so i clicked it
[03:18] <BarkingFish> ah, you missed a step in what i wrote above then :)
[03:18] <BarkingFish> "<BarkingFish> when you've done this, click close and you'll be told you need to update your sources"
[03:19] <rishubh> ya sorry i missed it
[03:19] <BarkingFish> in a few moments, it will finish and you will most likely get a symbol on your system bar - a cogwheel with a down arrow in it.

[03:19] <BarkingFish> you will have updates to put through :)
[03:19] <BarkingFish> i have it here, right now :)
[03:20] <tekkbuzz> anyone know where kde's x settings are stored at?
[03:21] <rishubh> by the way..i am dowloading software updates from software update...will that help?
[03:21] <BarkingFish> i don't really think it matters, rishubh - i use apper. Some people use muon, others use aptitude.  Whatever works is good :)
[03:23] <rishubh> BarkingFish: after all that what you said kubuntu opened software update and i ticked all the updates and clicked on install updatess..i hope i am goin right
[03:24] <BarkingFish> yep. You're installing what you asked for - proposed updates, and the adventurous stuff
[03:24] <BarkingFish> if you ticked it, you're getting it
[03:24] <DarthFrog> BarkingFish:  I use apt-get. :-)
[03:24] <BarkingFish> As I said.  Whatever works is good :)
[03:25] <rishubh> i think it will take some time...thankyou for helping..after it gets innstalled i will get back to you in case i have any problem..thanks
[03:25] <BarkingFish> ok, rishubh - i may not be here, since it's late where I am - 4.25 in the morning.
[03:25] <BarkingFish> other people will be here though, so if you don't get an answer straight away, hold on - someone will be around
[03:25] <rishubh> ok...thanks
[03:26] <BarkingFish> no problem

[06:50] <robtygart> Can anyone tell me why, when I open a Window Like Dolphin it always opens behind the window I have open
[06:55] <Tm_T> robtygart: how's your window settings?
[06:56] <robtygart> What do you mean?
[06:57] <robtygart> Tm_T: What do you mean?
[07:03] <Tm_T> robtygart: you can configure focus stealing prevention
[07:03] <Tm_T> or how windows are placed when opened
[07:05] <robtygart> Tm_T: focus stealing pervention. Yes I can
[07:07] <robtygart> Tm_T: OK I got it fix. Thank you very much!!!!
[07:08] <Tm_T> no prob
[07:08] <Tm_T> robtygart: you had focus stealing prevention set to max?
[07:09] <robtygart> Just about.. High, its set to low now.
[07:09] <robtygart> What does Focus stealing mean anyway?
[07:10] <robtygart> Odd name, I would not have guessed.
[07:12] <Tm_T> robtygart: focus stealing is when focus is taken by new window or dialog
[07:13] <Tm_T> robtygart: something that is not always desired, for example if you're writing a password to some text field and then chat window pops up taking the focus...
[07:13] <robtygart> Ok, thanks, I learned something new.
[07:14] <robtygart> Good idea.
[07:15] <robtygart> What level do you suggest?

[13:01] <raeg> Hello? Does this work?
[13:02] <lordievader> Hey raeg, you are coming in loud and clear :)
[13:02] <raeg> Ok, seems to be. I have a question about alsamixer. I would like to use skype. But although my loudspeakers work, my microphone does not. I tried changing the settings in alsamixer, without success.
[13:03] <lordievader> raeg: Doesn't Skype go through PulseAudio? Anyhow install pavucontrol and see if your mic is turned down.
[13:04] <raeg> Recently it still worked. Then I plugged in a usb-microphone, which worked well, too. But now that I want to use my old standart microphone, which has to be plugged into the microphone-thingy - it does not work anymore.
[13:05] <raeg> My ideas was to reset alsa, so I did: "sudo alsa force-reload" and "alsactl init" - which did not work.
[13:05] <Peace--> raeg: sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all ; rec -o test.wav
[13:05] <Peace--> press CTRL C to sto recording
[13:05] <Peace--> then
[13:06] <Peace--> play test.wav
[13:07] <Peace--> raeg: btw there is even kwave that is a recorder
[13:08] <raeg> Peace: Do you mean, that I can use the program "kwave" in order to test whether my microphone works?
[13:09] <Peace--> raeg: well i will use konsole with rec -o test.wav
[13:09] <Peace--> that is faster
[13:09] <Peace--> but if you prefer yuu can use kwave
[13:10] <raeg> Peace: I installed "sox libsox-fmt-all", now I am suggested I should restart my computer. Is that necessary?
[13:10] <Peace--> raeg: mm no
[13:10] <Peace--> raeg: rec -o test.wav

[13:35] <Peace--> raeg: if you want remove pulse audio  apt-get remove pulseaudio-utils pulseaudio
[13:35] <Peace--> then you can even re-install it
[13:35] <raeg> Peace--: These are all bars from alsamixer: http://imagebin.org/243285 and http://imagebin.org/243286
[13:36] <raeg> Peace--: How should I use pavucontrol? I installed and opened it - but I did get how it should help. It is a very confusing program.
[13:37] <Peace--> raeg: i dunno i have used one time btw aufnahme what is that ?
[13:37] <Peace--> i don't knwo german language
[13:37] <raeg> Peace--: Can it not become a problem if I remove pulseaudio?
[13:37] <raeg> "aufnahme" is "recording"
[13:38] <Peace--> raeg: mm tha should be to max
[13:38] <raeg> sure, but which one? and even if I max all of them - it does not help
[13:38] <raeg> btw: you already see: all are up
[13:38] <Peace--> raeg: like i said before to understand you need to put them all to max
[13:39] <Peace--> buddy as you want
[13:39] <Peace--> i need to go have luck
[13:39] <raeg> fair enough
[13:39] <ovidiu-florin> what packages are necessary for KDE development?
[13:40] <ovidiu-florin> I am reffering mostly to applications not the workspace
[14:06] <yofel> ovidiu-florin: installing the qt-sdk and kdevelop/qtcreator would be a good start. And looking at http://techbase.kde.org/Development
[14:06] <ovidiu-florin> I have those
[14:07] <ovidiu-florin> I've started but I can't compile any project due to this error: http://paste.kde.org/650360/
[14:11] <yofel> ovidiu-florin: odd, that should be part of libqt4-dev. Is that installed?
[14:12] <ovidiu-florin> yes it is
[14:15] <ovidiu-florin> I've used cmake-gui and fixed it... not sure how.. but it works now

[18:40] <FlowRiser> Hey all, i've got a question regarding the kubuntu startup; I've recently installed kubuntu on a netbook, it performs just fine; The problem is the startup time (3-4 minutes),  also immediately after showing the desktop it is so slow ... it works fine only after it shows up the warnings (i don't have a contact folder and updates); What can I do ? (I have 1.6 Ghz dual core, 1gb ram, vm.swappinness=10)
[18:40] <adil> Hello
[18:40] <FlowRiser> adil, yo
[18:40] <robtygart> FlowRiser: Do you have your graphic drivers installed
[18:41] <FlowRiser> robtygart, the graphic driver performs just fine; the problem lies in that slowness i experience prior to getting those popup warnings
[18:41] <robtygart> The last time mine was acting really slow, it was to do with my graphic drivers.
[18:42] <FlowRiser> robtygart, i will investigate that further, you might have a point
[18:42] <robtygart> When this happens try and get terminal up and type "top" or "htop" if you have it
[18:42] <robtygart> there you can see what the cpu and ram usage is
[18:43] <robtygart> then you can get some idea of what app is slowing you down,
[18:44] <FlowRiser> robtygart, the thing that most slows my system down at the beginning is PlasmaDesktop
[18:45] <FlowRiser> 14% cpu
[18:45] <robtygart> FlowRiser: give me the out put of
[18:45] <robtygart> lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 vga
[18:45] <robtygart> output*
[18:46] <FlowRiser> robtygart, wait a second, i need to get my other monitor in; I had to take it's lcd display, i needed it on a robot. brb 1 minute
[18:47] <robtygart> Another idea could be your desktop effects, if you have everything turned on you could be slowing it down there too.
[18:48] <FlowRiser> robtygart, i turned everything down, i even installed kubunut-low-fat-settings
[18:52] <FlowRiser> rotygart, so now it's booting up into the login screen
[18:53] <FlowRiser> it actually takes some time to boot into the kde-greeter
[18:54] <FlowRiser> and now, i logged in
[18:54] <andybrine> evening everyone
[18:54] <robtygart> Is this a lapotp
[18:55] <andybrine> can anyone recommend how to reinstall graphics drivers for intel 3000 hd
[18:55] <FlowRiser> robtygart, i know, i just have high expectations of kubuntu :D
[18:55] <andybrine> ?
[18:55] <robtygart> FlowRiser: its really peppy in mine and this is a 7 year old laptop
[18:56] <robtygart> andybrine: Have you looked in package manager?
[18:56] <FlowRiser> robtygart, finally to the desktop! :D
[18:56] <andybrine> I have the latest intel drivers from the packate manager
[18:56] <robtygart> Wowl thats really slow
[18:57] <FlowRiser> robtygart, exactly O>O
[18:57] <andybrine> when i first login, my graphics are very blocky
[18:57] <andybrine> and dont know why
[18:57] <andybrine> so i was going to install again
[18:57] <andybrine> see if it fixes it
[18:57] <FlowRiser> andybrine, when you are in the login screen ?
[18:58] <robtygart> There is an option in Package manager that you can make for re-installation.
[18:58] <andybrine> FlowRiser when i have hit login and its loading, all the graphics are messed up
[18:58] <robtygart> mark*
[18:59] <FlowRiser> andybrine, check your graphics driver, might be you have vesa or something like that
[18:59] <andybrine> what command do you use to check that?]
[19:00] <FlowRiser> robtygart, i got the output: Vga compatible controller ... Intel N10  ... Kernel driver in use: i915
[19:00] <FlowRiser> robtygart, mostly that
[19:01] <robtygart> That looks fine.
[19:01] <robtygart> My problems where coming from Nvida!
[19:02] <robtygart> Nvidia*
[19:02] <andybrine> there is a libva-intel-vaapi-driver, is that the one that needs installing?
[19:02] <FlowRiser> robtygart, oh god! :D I always remember when Linus Torvald said: "Nvidia f*** you!"
[19:02] <robtygart> lol
[19:02] <FlowRiser> robtygart, there's even a remix on youtube
[19:03] <robtygart> I don't think I seen the first vid, I only read the aretical
[19:03] <FlowRiser> robtygart, WATCH IT!
[19:03] <FlowRiser> and enjoy ;)
[19:03] <robtygart> andybrine: could you also give me the output if this lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 vga
[19:04] <robtygart> lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 vga
[19:04] <FlowRiser> robtygart, my system is faster than it was this morning, odly :|
[19:04] <robtygart> Have you ran any updaes?
[19:05] <FlowRiser> robtygart, let me check
[19:05] <andybrine> robtygart, i have just messaged you the output
[19:05] <robtygart> run
[19:05] <robtygart> sudo apt-get update
[19:05] <robtygart> Then
[19:05] <robtygart> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[19:06] <FlowRiser> robtygart, to be honest i'd rather stay at 12.04, what does dist-upgrade do ?
[19:07] <robtygart> type
[19:07] <robtygart> man apt-get
[19:07] <robtygart> I am not on Kubuntu at the moment, it can explain it better
[19:07] <FlowRiser> robtygart, thanks man :D
[19:08] <robtygart> it does the same thing as
[19:08] <robtygart> sudo apt-get upgrade, but it will do the most important package first..  Thats how "snowhog" told me thas how I should do it.. LOL
[19:08] <robtygart> he is around here somewhere I am sure
[19:09] <FlowRiser> robtygart, hehe, in linux there are allot of ways to do things :D
[19:09] <Unit193> robtygart: Not quite, upgrade will only update installed programs, dist-upgrade will also install programs if doing so is required when upgrading a package.  Like linux-image-generic when there is a new kernel out.
[19:10] <robtygart> Ok, I get it.
[19:11] <FlowRiser> I don't think this will solve my slow startup times, though
[19:13] <FlowRiser> swap memory, swappinness, can they influence my startup times with kubuntu ?
[19:16] <robtygart> I don't know.
[19:17] <BluesKaj> FlowRiser, nepomuk and akonadi can
[19:17] <BluesKaj> if they're enabled
[19:23] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, ok, i'll disable them after the update
=== paolo is now known as faLUCE
[19:24] <BluesKaj> FlowRiser, also if you init scripts running at high run level
[19:24] <BluesKaj> have
[19:25] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, how do i check those ?
[19:25] <BluesKaj> they're usually self made scrpits to start particular functions , not default stuff
[19:26] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, it's a fresh install, didn't really had time to "fiddle" >:)
[19:26] <BluesKaj> ok , FlowRiser ..what kind of boot times are you expecting ?
[19:28] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, i'm not talking about boot times, just startup times; Cause Unity+compiz performs much better than Kde
[19:28] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, example: from the login screen to kde it took 3-4 minutes! from the login screen to Unity+compiz 10 seconds
[19:28] <BluesKaj> hmm, odd , never noticed that unity was faster then kde
[19:29] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, you'd be surprised O.o
[19:29] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, but i need kde to work in
[19:29] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, so you can imagine my frustration when i have to wait 3 minutes just to get to the desktop
[19:30] <BluesKaj> FlowRiser, well you must have some other problem ..kde loads very quickly here , probly less tah 5-10 secs after login
[19:30] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, on my pc too, it takes 3-5 secdonds O.o
[19:31] <FlowRiser> i'll try again after update and reboot
[19:31] <FlowRiser> time it properly
[19:31] <BluesKaj> ok

[19:57] <apologeticnoob> Hi
[19:57] <apologeticnoob> I have a small issue that i could use some fresh eyes on
[19:57] <apologeticnoob> when i boot into kubuntu i get an error msg that says "Call to lnusertemp failed (temporary directory is full?) check your installation. This is just a popup i can click okay to and then i can log in with no problems.
[19:58] <apologeticnoob> something about kdeinit chrashes or something
[19:58] <apologeticnoob> 12.04
[19:59] <apologeticnoob> does anyone else have this or a fix to this?
[20:01] <BluesKaj>  apologeticnoob , have you updated and upgraded lately ?
[20:02] <apologeticnoob> yes
[20:02] <apologeticnoob> http://pastebin.com/Rn3sE8va
[20:02] <apologeticnoob> installed a few days ago
[20:03] <apologeticnoob> it is an old laptop, but everything works smoothly so i doubt it is an hardware issue
[20:04] <apologeticnoob> is kdm the right log to be reviewing?
[20:04] <apologeticnoob> I was not sure about that...
[20:07] <apologeticnoob> does this makes sense to you?
[20:08] <BluesKaj> looks like your xserver-xorg file is bit out of spec , but X server obviously recovers , and it's not serious , as long as yopu don't have any video or display problems
[20:08] <apologeticnoob> well i dont, but the boot delay is annoying
[20:08] <BluesKaj> Intel graphics ?
[20:08] <apologeticnoob> yea
[20:09] <apologeticnoob> gma 450 i think
[20:10] <apologeticnoob> should i be able to reinstall xserver without fucking everything up?
[20:11] <IdleOne> you should be able to ask without swearing
[20:11] <BluesKaj> you could try blanking the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and rebooting , unless of course you configured the file manually for other devices
[20:11] <apologeticnoob> how was that a swear?
[20:12] <apologeticnoob> ill try that
[20:12] <IdleOne> apologeticnoob: cursing is not allowed in *buntu channels
[20:12] <BluesKaj> we don't approve of the "f" word and othe curses
[20:12] <apologeticnoob> oh. I am truly sorry
[20:13] <invariant> When I resize a window under particular , X crashes. How can I modify the way kdm starts X?
[20:14] <invariant> s/under particular/under particular conditions
[20:15] <apologeticnoob> http://pastebin.com/LEZP32aQ
[20:15] <apologeticnoob> should it be there?
[20:19] <apologeticnoob> there is no /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[20:19] <apologeticnoob> should it be there?
[20:22] <BluesKaj> apologeticnoob, in some cases it's needed , and some not , the default is not ..if want to create xorg.conf (which can;t hurt) , do , sudo Xorg -configure
[20:23] <apologeticnoob> Fatal server error:
[20:23] <apologeticnoob> Server is already active for display 0
[20:23] <BluesKaj> invariant, Kwin is the kde window manager , kdm is the login page display
[20:24] <invariant> BluesKaj, please just answer the question.
[20:24] <invariant> BluesKaj, I don't ask questions for nothing.
[20:24] <invariant> BluesKaj, if you don't know the answer, that's also ok.
[20:24] <invariant> In that case, just don't say anything.
[20:25] <invariant> BluesKaj, I am interested in passing -core to X somewhere.
[20:26] <BluesKaj> invariant, you're assuming by your question that kdm is at fault , kwin and the window theme you have chosen might be buggy ..and if you continue your rude attitude then I won't bother you any longer
[20:26] <invariant> BluesKaj, no, you are assuming I am stupid.
[20:26] <invariant> BluesKaj, I already know what crashes.
[20:26] <invariant> BluesKaj, you are not helping.
[20:27] <invariant> BluesKaj, and I didn't say kdm is at fault.
[20:27] <invariant> BluesKaj, please try to _read_.
[20:27] <invariant> BluesKaj, your attitude is rude, because I am trying to fix the broken system the rest of the world has created and you are interfering in this process. You are supposed to be helping me.
[20:28] <BluesKaj> invariant, you're on ignore , don't waste your energy on me
[20:28] <invariant> Man, how hard can it be to just answer the question that is asked?
[20:28] <invariant> Yeah, that's a wonderful way to solve a problem. Ignoring it...
[20:32] <apologeticnoob> blueskaj, is it safe to stop Xorg and how do i do so?
[20:33] <apologeticnoob> or should i just "sudo Xorg -quiet" and the popup will go away?
[20:33] <apologeticnoob> treating the syntoms so to speak
[20:35] <BluesKaj> apologeticnoob, you can drop to a TTY , ALT+CTRL+F1 , then login and do sudo service lightdm (or kdm ) stop , the run your commands and then sudo service lightdm start
[20:36] <BluesKaj> !tty | apologeticnoob
[20:36] <ubottu> apologeticnoob: To get to the TTY terminals 1-6, use the keystroke ctrl + alt + F1-F6 respectively (Alt+F7 will get you back to your graphical login).  To change the resolution for your TTY, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ChangeTTYResolution
[20:37] <BluesKaj> tty is avery habdy method to configure and install apps that require X to be out of the loop
[20:37] <BluesKaj> err handy
