[02:21] <BarkingFish> good morning :)
[02:23] <BarkingFish> just had an interesting little discussion in #kubuntu with someone called TheLordOfTime - apparently, he's been informed by the release team and the core team that only Ubuntu calls itself an LTS  :)
[02:23] <BarkingFish> I called him out on it, using http://www.kubuntu.org/news/12.04-release as a source, and he gets all huffy with me and rageparts :)
[02:35] <BarkingFish> back in a moment, gotta refire the housebrick.
[03:27] <ScottK> Someone tell BarkingFish it's been fixed.
[07:34] <soee> good morning

=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[11:35] <soee> i see raring RC3 ready :)
[11:35] <soee> nice, any news about backport ?
[11:35] <Riddell> soee: still on raring, needing testing
[11:36] <soee> ah, i can test it on VM tonight
[11:53] <kubotu> ::runtime-bugs:: [1074371] In Kubuntu 12.10, systemsettings does not show "system languages" @ https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1074371 (by Ganton)
[12:06] <yofel_> hm, ninjas is running out of space... what is the janitor doing...
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[12:14] <Riddell> 10.0 GiB (99.61%) of 10.0 GiB
[12:14] <Riddell> hmm yes
[12:14] <Peace-> Riddell: do you know something about supend and ... eth problems with network manager in rarirn ?
[12:14]  * yofel tries to make kubuntu-ppa-build-status work on staging
[12:14] <Peace-> i am connected via wifi and it works after supend but eth0 won't do it 
[12:15] <Riddell> yofel: I would guess that's the packages for precise taking up extra space
[12:15] <Riddell> Peace-: nope
[12:15] <Peace-> mmm this installation of rarin is strange
[12:15] <yofel> Riddell: hm, before we uploaded 4.9.98 we had space though. I think it's just the janitor being a bit too lazy...
[12:15] <Peace-> i have done mini iso installation => kde-full selected 
[12:16] <yofel> Peace-: any hints in dmesg from the wakeup log?
[12:16] <Peace-> and it failed to install something 
[12:16] <Peace-> i guess some package
[12:16] <yofel> kde-full won't install kubuntu though
[12:16] <Peace-> then i have removed kde-full from the installation list and it worked
[12:16] <yofel> (at least some parts not)
[12:16] <Peace-> after that i ahve installed kubuntu-desktop and kde-full 
[12:17] <Peace-> and it did not installed xorg-xseerver-video intel but i dunno maybe it's correct in this way
[12:17] <Peace-> now :D eth doesn't connect after suspend 
[12:17] <Peace-> the weird thing is that i have another pc with raring that just works well 
[12:17] <Peace-> :D
[12:18] <Peace-> yofel: ok i will paste the error
[12:18] <Peace-> yofel: <info> (eth0): IP6 addrconf timed out or failed.
[12:19] <yofel> hm, that's hardly suprising unless you have ip6
[12:19] <Peace-> yofel: <warn> (eth0): DHCPv4 request timed out.
[12:19] <yofel> ok, that's worse
[12:19] <yofel> does ifconfig show the interface as up?
[12:20] <Peace-> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/650342
[12:20] <Peace-> yofel: for me is yes
[12:20] <yofel> what does dhclient say if you run it yourself
[12:20] <yofel> ?
[12:20] <Peace-> yofel: i need to run just dhclient on konsole?
[12:21] <yofel> sudo dhclient eth0 should work
[12:21] <Peace-> yofel: mm :D seems nothing 
[12:21] <yofel> o.O
[12:21] <Peace-> yofel: http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/18/plasma-desktopvd1995.png
[12:22] <yofel> then I'm clueless
=== apol_ is now known as apol
[12:22] <Peace-> infact is strange
[12:23] <yofel> try #ubuntu+1, maybe someone's awake
[12:23] <Peace-> yofel: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1545057
[12:24] <Peace-> yofel: ah no there  is no problem i mean i can reboot 
[12:24] <Peace-> or just use wifi 
[12:24] <yofel> true, but still...
[12:25] <yofel> ok, kubuntu-ppa-build-status now supports non-ninja tracking \o/
[12:25] <yofel> (thanks go to debfx for good script design..)
[12:26] <shadeslayer> err sorry for disappearing last night, a combination of rain + power outages knocked out my ISP
[12:26] <Peace-> shadeslayer: :D
[12:26] <Riddell> yofel: are you thinking of using staging for RC3 backports?
[12:26] <yofel> yeah
[12:26] <shadeslayer> otoh I figured out what was causing my video to not show up in pgst 
[12:26] <shadeslayer> so not a total loss
[12:27] <yofel> shadeslayer: could you guys please decide whether you don't have electricity because it's too hot or because you get shortcutted due to rain?
[12:28] <shadeslayer> hehe
[12:31] <Riddell> yofel: I just backported qextserialport into ninjas, a new marble dependency
[12:32] <yofel> raring?
[12:32] <Riddell> it's in the archive (debian sync)
[12:32] <Riddell> and I uploaded it for quantal and precise to ninjas
[12:34] <Riddell> so I'd say TODO for the day is: backport RC3, upload RC3 to raring archive, package amarok
[12:34] <Riddell> who wants what?
[12:35] <yofel> I'll copy what's needed into staging and then throw the backports in there, I don't think we really need to wait for the release announcement to put them there
[12:36] <yofel> if someone uses them before that and it breaks it's his fault
[12:36] <Peace-> yofel: mm i have solved bymyself
[12:36] <Peace-> yofel: :S with dhcp fails 
[12:39] <Riddell> yofel: groovy
[12:40] <sem_> mah with  static ip works again
=== sem_ is now known as Peace--
[12:41] <Riddell> I'll get it uploaded to raring once I've tested
[12:42] <Peace--> Riddell: system settings => input device => touchpad => crassh
[12:43] <Riddell> Peace--: hum, I agree
[12:44] <Peace--> Riddell: you got it too ?
[12:44] <Riddell> yep
[12:44] <Peace--> *.*
[12:44] <shadeslayer> use synaptiks
[12:45] <shadeslayer> that particular KCM uses python2 whereas the kcm is built against python3
[12:45] <Peace--> ah
[12:45] <yofel> apachelogger: didn't you plan to fix something there? ^
[12:45] <shadeslayer> and when I mean use synaptiks, I mean type 'synaptiks' in krunner :P
[12:46] <Peace--> :P
[12:47] <Peace--> sbivol:
[12:47] <Peace--> srr
[12:47] <Peace--> shadeslayer: funny i have not a touchpad it says 
[12:47] <shadeslayer> haha
[12:48] <Peace--> well i use a mouse so no problem at all :D
[13:29] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[13:39] <Peace--> bb
[13:44] <shadeslayer> yofel: what happened to quantal/precise backports status page?
[13:45] <yofel> I'm NOW starting to upload - there is nothing to generate stats from
[13:45] <jussi> has anyone got a lightdm theme for kubuntu that actually looks nice? 
[13:46] <shadeslayer> ah
[13:46] <shadeslayer> jussi: poke d_ed
[13:49] <Riddell> hum
[13:49] <Riddell> why have all my applications lost their menu bar in RC3?
[13:50] <jussi> Riddell: is the menu gone? or just hidden?
[13:50] <Riddell> it's gone
[13:50] <jussi> ouch
[13:51] <Riddell> Menubar Style is set to In application
[13:51] <jussi> Riddell: has chromium lost its initial tab also? (mine has)
[13:51] <Riddell> no chromium still has tabs, and that would be unrelated anyway
[13:51] <jussi> shadeslayer: Ill wait for d_ed to come in and Ill POUNCE on him...
[13:51] <shadeslayer> :D
[13:52] <jussi> Riddell: yeah, I know unrelated, but just asking for some confirmation from someone, as you all ignored me yesterday
[13:52] <jussi> :P
[13:53] <Riddell> hum, I can get menus back by setting them to window bar then back to menu bar
[13:53] <Riddell> hum
[13:53] <jussi> shadeslayer: see the ubuntu lightdm theme is nice... but the kubuntu one..........
[13:54] <shadeslayer> I know :)
[13:54] <jussi> Riddell: and the normal ctrl+m didnt help...?
[13:54] <shadeslayer> it'd be nice to get some sort of designer to design it
[13:54] <jussi> shadeslayer: ++
[13:54] <shadeslayer> and not a developer design it
[13:54] <jussi> shadeslayer: who was our resident designer here...
[13:54] <jussi> apart from nuno...
[13:54] <shadeslayer> idk
[13:55] <Riddell> sheyton did some back in the day
[13:55] <jussi> ahh yes, thats right. not around atm
[13:55] <jussi> I wonder how hard it is to do - might try my hand at it
[13:55] <shadeslayer> it's all QML
[13:55] <shadeslayer> and they say QML is easy
[13:55] <jussi> apparently...
[13:55] <jussi> shadeslayer: If I make a pretty picture, will you implement it? 
[13:56] <jussi> :D
[13:56] <shadeslayer> err no
[13:56] <shadeslayer> I don't like QML
[13:56] <jussi> bwahahah
[13:56]  * jussi hugs shadeslayer
[13:56] <shadeslayer> or rather, I don't like typeless languages in general
[13:56] <shadeslayer> they make my head spin
[13:56] <jussi> hehe
[13:56] <yofel> shadeslayer obviously doesn't do enough script programming
[13:57] <shadeslayer> not alot :)
[13:57] <yofel> (I understand your point though)
[13:57] <shadeslayer> I lurv my C's and C++'s
[13:58] <yofel> do we have some C like scripting language? (besides csh I mean)
[13:58] <shadeslayer> go?
[13:58] <yofel> ...
[13:58] <shadeslayer> :P
[13:59] <shadeslayer> they implemented the nexus 7 brightness handling and screen rotation stuff in go
[13:59] <yofel> ok, packages going up, will take a while
[13:59] <shadeslayer> but that takes up quite some memory ( 1.8 MB's )
[13:59] <shadeslayer> so they're going to re-implement it in C as a daemon
[14:00] <jussi> lol
[14:00] <jussi> hrm, so, be patient with me - Qt creator would be the place to begin with for the lightdm thing?  or? 
[14:00] <yofel> fun thing I saw recently was exception handling for OutOfMemoryError's in a java application I was asked to extend
[14:00] <shadeslayer> jussi: hmm ... no idea ...
[14:00] <yofel> that code was from around 2002 though
[14:02] <jussi> I guess Ill start by grabbing the source of lightdm-kde-greeter from the repos...
[14:12] <yofel> geh, the backport script can't handle the a suffix in 4.9.98a
[14:15] <Riddell> only 1 of them, just do it manually?
[14:15] <yofel> that's what I'm doing for now
[14:15] <yofel> I'll try to make the script handle that a bit better later
[14:17] <shadeslayer> heh
[14:39] <Riddell> trying out a new ec2 install and none of the applications have menus either with 4.9.97
[14:39] <Riddell> so I guess it's nothing new
[15:16] <yofel> shadeslayer: kde up for both, l10n up for quantal, l10n for precise will take a while longer
[15:17] <Riddell> kubuntu-archive-upload is taking is usual age to run
[15:17] <Riddell> I'm working on amarok in the mean time
[15:53] <Riddell> The name's Riddell http://starsky.19inch.net/~jr/tmp/kubuntu-card.jpg
[15:54] <Riddell> shadeslayer, Quintasan_: how's that?
[16:00] <apachelogger> yofel: the kcm still needs porting

[19:34] <shadeslayer> finally have internets :D
[19:34] <shadeslayer> ooohh
[19:35] <shadeslayer> Riddell: you already got them printed?
[19:36] <shadeslayer> and you have your @ubuntu.com address on them :P
[19:52] <ScottK> shadeslayer: the kpythonpluginmanager is built for both python and python3.
[19:52] <shadeslayer> oh
[19:53] <ScottK> If the python stuff is trying the python3 version, we need to fix that.
[19:53] <shadeslayer> then why does synaptiks crash via systemsettings?
[19:53] <shadeslayer> hm
[19:53] <shadeslayer> it's kind of weird
[19:53] <shadeslayer> because if you start synaptiks standalone it works
[19:55] <shadeslayer> bah, how long does it take to ack SRU's :(
[19:56] <ScottK> /usr/lib/kde4/kpythonpluginfactory.cpython-33m.so 	python3-pykde4
[19:56] <ScottK> /usr/lib/kde4/kpythonpluginfactory.so 	python-kde4
[19:56] <shadeslayer> and for some reason I don't see transmission in the precise queue
[19:57] <ScottK> So python shouldn't even recognize the python3 one as a valid python so file.
[20:00] <shadeslayer> oh heh
[20:51] <shadeslayer> errr ... aren't we a bit early with uploading the tarballs?
[20:51] <shadeslayer> I thought 4.9.98 was still embargoed
