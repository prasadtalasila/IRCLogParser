[01:40] <ScottK> Noskcaj: pbuilder isn't Kubuntu specific at all, so this isn't the right channel.
[03:11] <manchicken> apachelogger: Yo. You going to be online at all on Saturday?
[05:13] <smartboyhw> Someone please review https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/packaging-staging-1/+files/amarok_2.8.0-0ubuntu1.dsc
[06:31] <Noskcaj> ScottK, I asked here because he wasn't online in -motu
[06:32] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, private message?
[06:36] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, sure
[06:37] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, Don't ask to PM me, just PM. I'll either reply or not be there at all and see it later
[06:37] <smartboyhw> ah:)
[06:38] <smartboyhw> sure
[07:45] <Noskcaj> Riddell, PING
[07:59] <Noskcaj> Can someone look at https://code.launchpad.net/~noskcaj/ubuntu/saucy/ktp-call-ui/0.6.3-1 ? It's the only ktp branch that still needs to be edited for ubuntu
=== ghostcube_ is now known as ghostcube
[09:13] <Riddell> Noskcaj: hi
[09:15] <Noskcaj> hey Riddell. I've merged pbuilder already, do you mind looking at the branch? also, all but one of the ktp programs now have sync bugs. The other has ubuntu specific patches
[09:15] <Noskcaj> (which also need approving)
[09:18] <Riddell> https://code.launchpad.net/~noskcaj/ubuntu/saucy/pbuilder/215 ?
[09:18] <Noskcaj> Riddell, yep. sorry i forgot to link it
[09:22] <Riddell> looking
[09:22] <Noskcaj> thanks
[09:43] <Riddell> Noskcaj: waa
[09:43] <Riddell> [FAIL] test_debuildopts expected [] but got [/tmp/tmp.PD39vpkTKx/usr/share/pbuilder/pbuilderrc: line 3: keyk: command not found]
[09:43] <Riddell> Noskcaj: it fails on the tests, any idea what that's about?
[09:44] <Noskcaj> Riddell, no. It doesn't look related to anything i changed though. unless setting the distro as "saucy" caused it
[09:45] <Riddell> Noskcaj: do you know if anything is changed outside the debian/ directory compared to debian?
[09:46] <Riddell> mm yes lots
[09:48] <Noskcaj> Riddell, Most are from debian, some left over and auto-applied from previous uploads
[09:48] <Riddell> Noskcaj: it is something you've added http://paste.kde.org/p4c4bd722/
[09:50] <Noskcaj> Riddell, i don't remember doing that. i assume fixing it will fix the tests breakage
[09:51] <Noskcaj> but debian didn't do that, so i must have somehow deleted that by accident. 
[09:55] <Noskcaj> Riddell, I have to go now. If there's anything that i need to change, ping me in the morning (2000UTC)
[09:57] <Riddell> Noskcaj: it's working with that removed, thanks for the merge
[10:09] <Riddell> hum, ktp-accounts-kcm in debian has a different md5sum from upstream and us
[10:11] <Riddell> and other ktp bits too
[10:20] <smartboyhw> Riddell: yofel or whoever: Do you guys have experience with generated .la files having problems with https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/LAFileRemoval ?
[10:23] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer: apachelogger^
[10:25] <Riddell> smartboyhw: not sure what your question is, I think if you remove a .la file you need to rebuild all the rdepends
=== Blizzzek is now known as Blizzz
[10:26] <smartboyhw> Riddell: the problem is that the file keeps being generated at build-time..
[10:27] <Riddell> smartboyhw: what's the problem? either package it or don't surely
[10:28] <Riddell> !testers | user-manager from git needs testing
[10:28] <ubottu> user-manager from git needs testing: Help is needed in #kubuntu-devel. Please ping Riddell, yofel, soee, Tm_T, shadeslayer, BluesKaj, James147, smartboyhw, Quintasan, lordievader, shrini, tester56 for information.
[10:28] <smartboyhw> Riddell: here's the problem. Some of the dependeny_lib are useful to be linked, some or not.....
[10:28] <smartboyhw> *are
[10:29] <smartboyhw> Hmm...
[10:38] <smartboyhw> Riddell: BTW, got some time to review 2.8.0?
[10:38] <smartboyhw> I mean, for Amarok
[10:38] <smartboyhw> It's in my packaging-staging-1 PPA
[10:38] <Riddell> smartboyhw: sure, where's packaging-staging-1?
[10:38] <smartboyhw> Riddell: find it in launchpad.net/~smartboyhw please;P
[10:38] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you done it for saucy? planning on raring or precise?
[10:38] <smartboyhw> I'm currently in Debian
[10:39] <smartboyhw> Riddell: review it for Saucy first:P
[10:39]  * smartboyhw reboots back to Ed/K/Ubuntu:P
[10:44] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I'm back:P
[10:44] <Riddell> welcome back!
[10:45] <smartboyhw> Riddell, so, you managed to find my PPA?
[10:51] <Riddell> smartboyhw: sorry testing user-manager right now
[11:08] <yofel> smartboyhw: not really, I don't know much about libtool
[11:13] <smartboyhw> yofel, :(
[11:13] <smartboyhw> yofel, then you got anytime to review amarok?:P
[11:14] <yofel> too busy, sorry
[11:14] <smartboyhw> Meh:(
[11:44] <yofel> smartboyhw: what's up with this bzr diff? http://paste.kde.org/p6ba14f34
[11:45] <yofel> also, unless the package was uploaded to archive, bzr series is UNRELEASED
[11:45] <yofel> the uploader sets that and tags
=== ghostcube_ is now known as ghostcube
[11:57] <markey> smartboyhw: how is Amarok 2.8 packaging coming along?
[11:57] <markey> we plan to make the release official tonight
[11:57] <markey> public I mean
[11:57] <smartboyhw> yofel, ask yofel ...
[11:58] <markey> yofel: ^ :)
[11:58] <smartboyhw> yofel, DUNNO about the control file...
[11:58]  * smartboyhw did not notice that...
[11:58] <yofel> smartboyhw: I'm waiting for you to answer why you overwrote my change
[11:58] <smartboyhw> yofel, I don't know (AT ALL)
[11:58]  * smartboyhw wonders what the hell had happened...
[11:59] <yofel> let me guess? you started form the archive package, then took bzr, updated, copied your debian folder to bzr and comitted?
[11:59] <smartboyhw> yofel, uh huh
[11:59] <yofel> well, like this you will loose any changes that are staged in bzr
[12:00] <smartboyhw> Sorry...
[12:00] <smartboyhw> My epic fault:(
[12:01] <yofel> well, happens, please watch next time. It can also happen that people upload without committing to bzr so you need to watch both directions
[12:03] <smartboyhw> yofel, sorry again..
[12:04] <yofel> no problem, that's what we do the reviews for ;)
[12:04] <smartboyhw> yofel, :P
[12:07] <yofel> smartboyhw: do you want to fix it or should I?
[12:07] <smartboyhw> yofel, you:)
[12:08] <yofel> ok
[12:19] <yofel> smartboyhw: looks good otherwise, uploaded
[12:20] <smartboyhw> yofel, but now we are receiving many reports of 4.11 upgrades not working;O
[12:21] <yofel> "many" where?
[12:21] <smartboyhw> yofel, #kubuntu
[12:21] <smartboyhw> 3 at the same time (suddenly)
[12:23] <yofel> I don't really have time for support, but I can at least look at the one who posted the apt output
[12:44] <Riddell> ta da http://docs.kubuntu.org
[12:45] <smartboyhw> yofel, can you tell Riddell what packages to rebuild?
[12:45] <smartboyhw> ^
[12:45] <Riddell> manchicken: plenty of bugs in that should you be interested in fixing them :)
[12:45] <smartboyhw> yofel, which ones anyway?
[12:45] <Riddell> smartboyhw: who what?
[12:45] <smartboyhw> Riddell, nothing, :P
[12:45] <manchicken> Riddell: I'm going to try to get in some work tomorrow after my half marathon.
[12:45] <yofel> Riddell: discussing bug 1213066
[12:45] <ubottu> bug 1213066 in Kubuntu PPA "Upgrade to 4.11 causes vast packages removal" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1213066
[12:46] <yofel> which is mostly extra kde stuff
[12:46] <manchicken> Riddell: I've been doing a lot of studying and code quizzes for a job hunt.
[12:46] <smartboyhw> yofel, so basically, every package depending on libtaskmanager needs a bump, right?
[12:47] <yofel> pretty much, a no change rebuild should suffice
[12:47] <yofel> but do check whether it actually builds
[12:48] <Riddell> what version is this?
[12:49] <yofel> precise
[12:50] <Riddell> so these ones http://paste.kde.org/p2cd3656f/
[12:50] <smartboyhw> That's mostly kde-workspace
[12:51] <Riddell> I did test upgrade with kde-full and kubuntu-full installed but I guess those are obscure plugins and the like not included in those meta packages
[12:51] <Riddell> less these ones http://paste.kde.org/p1d557de8/
[12:52] <smartboyhw> Riddell, but the package NAMES are the same
[12:52] <Riddell> mm good point
[12:55] <smartboyhw> yofel, hmm code failure for amarok armhf again sigh (even with the libopengl depend optional now)
[12:55] <smartboyhw> Alright, the .so files again:P
[12:56] <manchicken> Riddell: There are several companies I may end up going to work for, I had to learn a bunch of algorithm stuff for the interviews. I'm hopefully coming off of that now.
[12:56] <smartboyhw> Riddell, how to remove a file for a specific architecture in debian/rules?
[12:57] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you mean delete it only on arm?
[12:57] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yep
[12:58] <manchicken> Okay, I'm going to go to the current job. Later.
[12:59] <Riddell> ifeq (,$(filter $(DEB_HOST_ARCH),armel armhf))
[12:59] <Riddell>  rm file
[12:59] <Riddell> endif
[12:59] <smartboyhw> Riddell, thank you:P
[12:59] <Riddell> smartboyhw: would be one way?
[13:00] <Riddell> so elequent is makefile syntax
[13:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, actually, I'm wrong, I mean for a .install file:P
[13:06] <smartboyhw> Like, that file doesn't exist in armhf
[13:06] <Riddell> smartboyhw: needs a separate foo.install.armhf file
[13:06] <Riddell> check  man dh_install  for the syntax
[13:07] <smartboyhw> Riddell, so I copy everything over, and comment out that file?
[13:07] <Riddell> yeah I think so, check the man page
[13:07] <Riddell> (another way is to not include the file in the .install and have something in rules which copies it if it's there)
[13:08] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I don't think it says about .install.armhf files..
[13:09] <Riddell> hmm you're right, but try it, it should work
[13:09] <smartboyhw> Riddell, sure
[13:11] <smartboyhw> Riddell, wait, I saw in not-installed that some files are installed using debian/rules for non-arm only, but where's that relative bit in rules?
[13:13] <Riddell> mm kde-window-manager breaks old styles manually that's what it is http://paste.kde.org/p8825d2a5/
[13:13] <Riddell> smartboyhw: relative bit?
[13:14] <yofel> I backported a working qtcurve now
[13:14] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I mean, the bit that installs those files
[13:14] <yofel> the rest doesn't look fixable from our side
[13:15] <Riddell> smartboyhw: what are you packaging?
[13:15] <smartboyhw> Riddell, amarok.
[13:16] <smartboyhw> The armhf build failed because one of the spectrum files wasn't included in that “using debian/rules to install specifically to non-arm"
[13:17] <Riddell> smartboyhw: hmm, yes, not sure what's happened there
[13:17] <smartboyhw> ...
[13:18] <Riddell> smartboyhw: this is what's in an old revision http://paste.kde.org/pece4cf60/
[13:18]  * smartboyhw checks the logs:P
[13:18] <Riddell> ah moved by yofel with comment   * Remove spectrum analyzer file from debian/rules, no longer upstream
[13:18] <yofel> uhm
[13:19] <yofel> sounds vaguely familiar now that you mention it
[13:19] <smartboyhw> uhm obviously
[13:19] <smartboyhw> It's still included...
[13:19] <smartboyhw> Well, with another filename though:P
[13:20] <yofel> is it?
[13:20]  * yofel testbuilds
[13:21] <smartboyhw> yofel, 
[13:21] <smartboyhw> cp: cannot stat 'debian/tmp/usr/lib/kde4/amarok_context_applet_analyzer.so': No such file or directory
[13:21] <smartboyhw> Without the "spectrum"
[13:21] <smartboyhw> Damnitr
[13:22] <yofel> ah
[13:22]  * smartboyhw adds it
[13:29] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yofel please check on kubuntu-packaging/amarok branch
[13:32] <Riddell> smartboyhw: ifeq (,$filter armel armhf,$(DEB_HOST_ARCH)))
[13:32] <Riddell> shouldn't htat be ifneq?
[13:32] <smartboyhw> Riddell, you gave me http://paste.kde.org/pece4cf60/
[13:33] <smartboyhw> Oh wait, I forgot to endif though
[13:33] <Riddell> smartboyhw: well did you compile it to check?
[13:33] <Riddell> does usr/lib/kde4/amarok_data_engine_spectrum_analyzer.so not exist? if not remove it the comment from the .install file
[13:34] <yofel> ifeq is correct
[13:34] <smartboyhw> Riddell, it exists, but not for armhf
[13:34] <Riddell> smartboyhw: keeping that indentation would be good
[13:34] <smartboyhw> Since there is NO libopengl for armhf
[13:34]  * smartboyhw hates indentation:(
[13:34] <Riddell> smartboyhw: so shouldn't it be in debian/rules?
[13:34] <yofel> smartboyhw: make is very particular about indentation
[13:34] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ah, you mean that
[13:35] <yofel> and correct type of indentation
[13:35] <yofel> what you did is invalid btw.
[13:35] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh?
[13:36] <smartboyhw> Riddell, with spectrum not
[13:36] <yofel> ifeq/endif mustn't be indented
[13:36] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK, fixing...
[13:36] <yofel> and indentation needs to be exactly one tab
[13:36] <yofel> no spaces
[13:38] <smartboyhw> yofel, check current branch?
[13:38] <yofel> smartboyhw: for reference http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Syntax
[13:39]  * smartboyhw adds another doc to TOREAD
[13:39] <yofel> the full make manual is LONG, no need to read everything. But the basics are mandatory
[13:40] <smartboyhw> yofel, the basics = everything....
[13:40] <yofel> smartboyhw: yeah, that should work now
[13:41] <yofel> does it build?
[13:41] <smartboyhw> yofel, running debuild -j4 here
[13:41] <yofel> :)
[13:41] <smartboyhw> I WANT A -j8!!!!!
[13:42] <yofel> get yourself another PC and use icecc
[13:42] <yofel> not that it works here
[13:42] <Riddell> or one of the expensive ec2s
[13:43] <smartboyhw> yofel, Riddell NO MONEY
[13:44] <yofel> ccache would be an idea too, but that's been pretty unreliable for me lately so I'm not using it anymore
[13:44] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you can ask me to set them up, but it takes some time to set up so no great advantage in this case
[13:45] <smartboyhw> Riddell, you testbuilding in a armhf would be good;P
[13:46] <Riddell> alas I don't have one of those today
[13:47] <Riddell> and I couldn't work out how to get NAT working on my modem so I can't make one available :(
[13:47] <smartboyhw> Riddell, .............................
[13:48] <yofel> Scott's builders work again, but I'm on the wrong notebook here
[13:49] <smartboyhw> That's a full MEH
[14:04] <smartboyhw> yofel, Riddell it at least builds.....
[14:17] <smartboyhw> yofel, Riddell so, you guys can upload the fix from kubuntu-packaging branch now I think
[14:18] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you think? did you compile it?
[14:18]  * shadeslayer is having crappy monitor issues
[14:18] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yes
[14:18] <smartboyhw> compiled
[14:18] <shadeslayer> I think the cable is frayed a bit too much
[14:18] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh
[14:21] <Riddell> hmm there's a dozen ec2 volumes that have been running for months costing us money, I'll delete them
[14:21] <shadeslayer> O_O
[14:22] <smartboyhw> o-o
[14:23] <shadeslayer> Riddell: you should have a script that runs every night at 00:00 hours that shuts down ec2 isntances
[14:23] <Riddell> shadeslayer: well volumes not instances
[14:23] <shadeslayer> oh
[14:23] <Riddell> I'm not quite sure what a volume is
[14:24] <Riddell> or why they hang around when I never explicitly started them
[14:24] <smartboyhw> O-O
[14:24] <Riddell> I think I did have one to kill instances and it killed the one you were running so I stopped it
[14:24] <shadeslayer> oh heh
[14:24] <Riddell> shadeslayer: are these neon kvms still used?
[14:25] <shadeslayer> I am unsure, if they cost too much we can kill those IMHO
[14:27] <Riddell> shadeslayer: they don't cost much but I'll delete ones from last year
[14:27]  * Riddell deletes 100 kvm things
[14:28] <shadeslayer> sure
[14:28] <shadeslayer> IMHO you can delete upto this month
[14:31] <Riddell> smartboyhw: uploaded!
[14:31] <Riddell> smartboyhw: are you able to backport to raring and precise now or shall I do it?
[14:32] <shadeslayer> ScottK: no ktp review? :(
[14:33] <Riddell> shadeslayer: what needs reviewed?
[14:33] <smartboyhw> Riddell, you:P
[14:33] <shadeslayer> Riddell: ktp 0.6.3 in raring unapproved queue
[14:33] <shadeslayer> me and smartboyhw SRU'd it
[14:33] <smartboyhw> REMINDER: Kubuntu 12.04.3 is NEXT WEEK
[14:34] <Riddell> ah, SRU

[14:37] <Riddell> hmm, amarok wants libtag 1.9
[14:38] <Riddell> but there's no such thing on http://taglib.github.io/
[14:47] <tester56> there is a bug in the unetbootin package in saucy
[14:48] <tester56> when launching it asks for the password but it fails unlocking (says wrong password)
[14:48] <tester56> launching as root from terminal works though
[14:48] <shadeslayer> report it?
[14:48] <shadeslayer> not something we can fix tbh
[14:49] <tester56> gksu is such an unnecessary dependency in a kde environment 
[14:55] <Riddell> +find_package( Qt4 4.8.3 COMPONENTS QtCore QtGui QtScript QtSvg QtXml QtWebKit REQUIRED )
[14:55] <Riddell> waa amarok has updated to qt 4.8.3, so can't backport precise without that
[15:00] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yeah:(
[15:02] <shadeslayer> Don't we have qt 4.8.4 for precise?
[15:02] <shadeslayer> in the backports PPA
[15:02] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh!?
[15:03] <smartboyhw> YEAH!
[15:03] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ^
[15:03] <Riddell> no it has 4:4.8.2+dfsg-2ubuntu1~precise1~ppa5
[15:04] <Riddell> but it's fine they only bumped to 4.8.3 for the qtscript breakage which we patch for

[15:37] <smartboyhw> And actually, 12.04 LTS , not 12.04LTS:P
[15:38] <smartboyhw> Riddell, OK here
[15:38] <rshort> Riddell, He's here just been on the phone all day he says Vinay's been working on the checkout
[15:43] <Riddell> rshort: tell vinay he's welcome in here if he wants me to test it
[15:51] <Riddell> vinay!
[15:51] <Riddell> how's the checkout going?
[15:52] <smartboyhw> markey, we are ready for Amarok 2.8 release:)
[15:53] <markey> excellent :)
[15:55] <Riddell> smartboyhw: have they both compiled in the backports?
[15:55] <smartboyhw> Riddell, raring publishing
[15:55] <smartboyhw> Precise probably not yet though, it builds at least:P
[15:56] <smartboyhw> Actually, even precise finished
[15:56] <vinay_> Hi Riddell, checkout's going fine, just finishing up on a few little things
[15:56] <smartboyhw> Both waiting for publishing
[15:58] <Riddell> vinay_: let me know if it's ready for proofreading or testing
[15:59] <vinay_> will do
[16:05] <TheOneRing> hm I try to build kde without nepomuk, and  then i dont need soprano but if i try to build akonadi I get
[16:05] <TheOneRing> -- The following REQUIRED packages have not been found:
[16:05] <TheOneRing>  * Soprano , Storage of semantic data , <http://soprano.sourceforge.net>
[16:05] <TheOneRing>    Soprano is needed for the Nepomuk search backend
[16:05] <TheOneRing> which doesnt make that much sence?
[16:06] <vHanda> true. Akonadi should be made to work with Soprano
[16:06] <vHanda> it's probably very simple
[16:07] <vHanda> I just checked, and you can mark it as optional and it should compile
[16:08] <vHanda> TheOneRing: change Soprano from REQUIRED to OPTIONAL
[16:08] <TheOneRing> kk
[16:08] <vHanda> ahh! If you have Strigi installed then Soprano is optional otherwise it is required. Because without either of them you will not have search
[16:09] <vHanda> line 34 CMakeLists
[16:30] <Riddell> sigh, pinentry has spontaniously stopped working for me with gpg :(
[16:58] <contrast> Greetings. :) Sorry to bug you all, but I just saw Amarok 2.8 has been backported to Precise and Raring, but not Quantal. Any hopes of that happening if I test the packages (since this was the only thing initially holding back KDE 4.11 on Quantal)?
[17:02] <shadeslayer> contrast: probably
[17:04] <contrast> Ok... So should I just keep an eye on the Staging PPA like before, or..?
[17:25] <Riddell> hum, ok so there's 1 user on quantal who wants backports :)
[17:31] <contrast> Riddell: Well, there's me and the ~half a dozen friends/family members whose systems I support. ;)
[17:32] <Riddell> oh ok ok I'll do it
[17:32] <Riddell> just cos it's you :)
[17:32] <contrast> haha Thanks, man. I really appreciate it. :)
[17:34] <contrast> I don't want to raise a stink or anything -- I get that Quantal users are probably a near-negligible minority. It's just that it's hard for me to justify upgrading to Raring given it will stop being supported before the next LTS release comes out. :\
[18:50] <Peace-> mmm what is this ? http://paste.opensuse.org/16373846
[20:14] <markey> Riddell: folks: Amarok 2.8 is officially released :)

[20:14] <markey> and a huge Thank You to you for your timely packaging and the great distro you provide!
[20:14] <markey> it's the best I could wish for

[22:41] <mtu> hi ppl. the 4.11 quantal backports PPA upgrade has totally fried my KDE4, as in it won't start. i see "no DBUS session-bus" in kdmlog. i cannot even startx into it, even though the X server is fine (no errors).
[22:41] <mtu> any thoughts on debugging?
