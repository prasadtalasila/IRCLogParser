[01:16] <OberonKing> i use kubuntu-backport to install it
[04:00] <tonal> Hello All
[04:01] <tonal> I update kde from Kubuntu Backports ppa
[04:01] <tonal> And Kopete crash for start
[04:02] <tonal> In console I see: kopete: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/kde4/kopete_icq.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5Oscar6Client15connectToServerERK7QStringtbS3_
[04:02] <tonal> How to resolve it?
[04:03] <tonal> My OS - Kubuntu 13.04
[04:05] <nerdtron> have you tried reinstalling kopete? sudo apt-get purge kopete
[04:07] <nerdtron> also before installing kopete again, show hidden file in your home folder, rename the folder .kopete to .kopete.bak
[04:08] <nerdtron> then launch kopete again
[04:22] <tonal> I reinstall: aptitude reinstall kopete
[04:23] <tonal> I see error string - problem in /usr/lib/kde4/kopete_icq.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5Oscar6Client15connectToServerERK7QStringtbS3_
[04:25] <tonal> IMHO developer change name for function or its signatures, but forget change client code...

[12:09] <six86> hello. since I updated to KDE 4.11 yesterday I have no kubuntu-desktop package anymore. I also cannot reinstall it because of hold back broken packages packages. There are also other packages missing like kde-window-manager and kde-workspace. I can login but i ave no window manager, no window decorations and so on... can someone help me please?
[12:10] <smartboyhw> six86, :O
[12:10] <smartboyhw> Can you access the Konsole?
[12:13] <nick87720z> hi people. Did anyone upgrade to 4.11 without troubles?
[12:14] <smartboyhw> nick87720z, what's your issue?
[12:14] <smartboyhw> Tell us please..
[12:14] <nick87720z> when i try, it want to remove kwin-style-qtcurve
[12:14] <nick87720z> and many other packages
[12:14] <volty> hi, after doing upgrade X doesn't start
[12:14] <smartboyhw> nick87720z, hmm
[12:14] <volty> how can I fix this pls?
[12:15] <nick87720z> i'm about kubuntu backport
[12:15] <nick87720z> ppa
[12:15] <ladylee> hi
[12:15] <ladylee> im new here
[12:15] <ladylee> i need to know a few things about kubuntu installation
[12:15] <smartboyhw> nick87720z, can you give me a paste of the apt-get output?

[12:15] <smartboyhw> ladylee, yes, just ask。。。
[12:16] <ladylee> does it easily install and configure net by itself like ubuntu?
[12:16] <nick87720z> yep. I already made some non-destructive upgrades
[12:16] <smartboyhw> ladylee, yes, we use the same installer (ubiquity)
[12:16] <nick87720z> for now i have removed tasks-icons
[12:17] <nick87720z> (looking to log in muon)
[12:17] <ladylee> does it have gimp and other graphical options as in linux mint and ubuntu etc?
[12:17] <smartboyhw> ladylee, Kubuntu IS Ubuntu to be honest
[12:17] <smartboyhw> Just comes with different packages pre-installed
[12:17] <smartboyhw> So, what's available on Ubuntu, you get it on Kubuntu
[12:18] <volty> sorry but, since quite urgent, i repeat and restate: after upgrading yesterday X doesn't start (no mouse pointer or whatsoever); how can I fix it, what should i reinstall, why this mess?
[12:18] <monkeyjuice> ladylee: maybe try a live cd and look at it first
[12:19] <ladylee_>  does it have gimp and other graphical options as in linux mint and ubuntu etc?
[12:19] <ladylee_> sorry got dc
[12:19] <nick87720z> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5992491
[12:19] <smartboyhw> ladylee_, yes
[12:19] <monkeyjuice> yes ladylee_
[12:20] <six86> smartboyhw: yes i can
[12:20] <nick87720z> smartboyhw: there are not only kubuntu upgrades, but as for qtcurve - it's removal is caused by kubuntu upgrades
[12:20] <smartboyhw> six86, nick87720z probably you two have the same problem...
[12:20] <six86> strg-alt-f1, but not the graphical window in kde, because i cannot get focus there
[12:22] <nick87720z> smartboyhw: kde-plasma-desktop only causes vast removal
[12:23] <yofel> nick87720z: what kubuntu release are you on?
[12:23] <monkeyjuice> hang around smartboyhw is trying to get more help here
[12:23]  * smartboyhw forgotten the debug apt-get command...
[12:23] <nick87720z> smartboyhw: i'm using kubuntu-backport ppa with ubuntu 12.04
[12:23] <smartboyhw> six86, what release are you using?
[12:23] <smartboyhw> volty, ^
[12:23] <nick87720z> more exactly, initiall it was ubuntustudio
[12:23] <smartboyhw> nick87720z, hah!?
[12:23] <smartboyhw> OK...
[12:24] <smartboyhw> It shouldn't fail though

[12:25] <nick87720z> may be some packages are forgotten during rebuild?
[12:25] <smartboyhw> tonal, what release?
[12:25] <smartboyhw> nick87720z, we just batch-copy
[12:25] <yofel> nick87720z: they probably need a rebuild
[12:25] <yofel> at least I know that none of the were tested
[12:25] <yofel> *of them
[12:25] <tonal> 13.04
[12:25] <smartboyhw> tonal, wait..
[12:25] <tonal> I update for Kubuntu baskport ppa
[12:26] <nick87720z> on gentoo i have 4.11 enough long time
[12:26] <volty> smartboyhw, i' m too with kubuntu-backport ppa, going to force reinstall of kdm, then of kubunut-desktop
[12:26] <nick87720z> (very soon as it was released, at least much earlier than there)
[12:26] <yofel> nick87720z: please file a bug on https://bugs.launchpad.net/kubuntu-ppa/+filebug and post the apt output there, then we can look at it
[12:27] <yofel> hm? 4.11 was released 2 days ago
[12:27] <smartboyhw> tonal, what architecture?

[12:27] <smartboyhw> tonal, weird weird
[12:28] <volty> if i cannot fix i'll just reinstall kubuntu and never again trust backports
[12:28] <yofel> volty: is kubuntu-desktop installed?
[12:28] <smartboyhw> tonal, we have two symbols that aren't added, but it shouldn't fail to look up a symbol
[12:28] <smartboyhw> If the symbol doesn't exist, we would have build failures over here...
[12:29] <six86> so any ideas how i can reinstall kubuntu-desktop?
[12:29] <yofel> just 'sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop'
[12:29] <six86> mh no :)
[12:29] <volty> yofel, of course, everything worked fine until yesterday, for many years now
[12:30] <tonal> i reinstall kopete: aptitude reinstall. But error also.
[12:30] <six86> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/pe9d1256d/
[12:30] <smartboyhw> tonal, hmm.....
[12:30] <ladylee_> thank you smartboyhw i was so worried that i would get stuck after installing kubuntu :$
[12:31] <yofel> volty: what does your /var/log/Xorg.0.log say?
[12:31] <smartboyhw> ladylee_, you won't:)
[12:31] <yofel> six86: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop kde-window-manager kde-workspace
[12:31] <yofel> that should show a bit more
[12:31] <smartboyhw> tonal, report bug at https://bugs.launchpad.net/kubuntu-ppa/+filebug first please....
[12:32] <smartboyhw> I will try to see what exactly has happened...
[12:32] <smartboyhw> But a missing symbol should have been captured on our side, not on user side..
[12:32] <six86> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/p6e2f6ca3/
[12:33] <volty> yofel, i'm on windoz now, going to check the log, thnereinstall kdm and kubuntu-desktop, then install a parallel, same, kubuntu without ppa's (like i did until few month ago), thx
[12:33] <smartboyhw> six86, what does sudo apt-get install libegl1-mesa-drivers give you?
[12:33] <yofel> volty: did you manually switch to kdm?
[12:33] <yofel> if not then lightdm is what's used
[12:34] <yofel> on 13.04
[12:34]  * smartboyhw likes LightDM:P
[12:34] <yofel> six86: are you using the X/mesa backports?
[12:34] <six86> I use xorg/edgers
[12:34] <smartboyhw> six86, DON‘T。。。
[12:35] <yofel> oh, you're on 13.04
[12:35] <volty> yofel, no, it was a standard install, default kdm, something went wrong because of configuration files (bugs of ppa) or because of messing between integrated updater and apt-get cli
[12:35] <yofel> volty: default is lightdm
[12:35] <yofel> not kdm
=== dilfridge is now known as systemd
=== systemd is now known as dilfridge
[12:36] <yofel> sadly, without logs I'm really clueless what the issue is. the X log might tell something, otherwise look at the apt logs in /var/log/apt/ whether something went wrong there
[12:37] <volty> thx a lot
[12:37] <volty> bye
[12:37] <smartboyhw> ;o
[12:37] <six86> So even if I remove the edgers repo, i cannot install anything. How can i fix the mess?
[12:37] <yofel> six86: what does aptitude say if you try the same thing?
[12:38] <yofel> that doesn't give up as fast as apt does
[12:38] <six86> Gives me two possibilities: Keep the old version or leave the issue unresolved
[12:39] <nick87720z> yofel: Is it enough to insert links to logs, which i already inserted?
[12:39] <yofel> by saying no you can cycle through a few different solutions

[12:41] <yofel> thanks!
[12:41] <nick87720z> :)
[12:41] <smartboyhw> nick87720z, :)
[12:41] <six86> hm, so what is the actual problem now? Are there problems between xorg/edgers and 4.11?
[12:41] <yofel> six86: I'll try to replicate that in a bit here
[12:42] <yofel> we certainly don't test mixing backports and edgers
[12:42] <smartboyhw> nick87720z, I have an impression that it might be a problem with KXStudio or something
[12:42] <smartboyhw> six86, edgers is really NOT recommend for users AT ALL.
[12:42] <nick87720z> need to check, does first case involve kxstudio stuff
[12:43] <six86> yofel: thx, I never had problems with that combination, there was a reason why I used edgers some time ago, but I can't remember
[12:43] <smartboyhw> nick87720z, yes
[12:43] <yofel> smartboyhw: well, most of the plasma widgets probably have an issue with libtaskmanager, for the rest someone needs to investigate
[12:43] <smartboyhw> I saw kxstudio-desktop-kde here
[12:43] <smartboyhw> yofel, libtaskmanager?
[12:43] <yofel> libtaskmanager4abi3 is now libtaskmanager4abi4, and they're not co-installable
[12:44] <smartboyhw> yofel, so, we forgot to break/conflict
[12:44] <smartboyhw> ?
[12:44] <yofel> no, a few external packages need rebuilds
[12:44] <smartboyhw> yofel, eh, I will rather ask Riddell about rebuilds:p
[12:44] <six86> yofel: how does this sound to you: http://paste.kde.org/pcbd8c5a4/ ?
[12:45] <yofel> smartboyhw: do it yourself, it's not really his job. Those are all 3rd party widgets
[12:45] <nick87720z> no, kxstudio is not reason
[12:45] <nick87720z> rather more: kxstudio-desktop-kde4 is affected
[12:47] <yofel> hm, just installing stock 13.04 + backports + edgers works fine here
[12:48] <yofel> six86: can you find at least one solution where aptitude does install kubuntu-desktop?
[12:52] <yofel> nick87720z: I cannot find kxstudio-desktop-kde4 in the archive
[12:52] <smartboyhw> yofel, that's PPA..
[12:52] <smartboyhw> It's another distro
[12:52] <six86> yofel: I don't think so. looking thorugh the possibilities for minutes now :)
[12:52] <smartboyhw> Non-official
[12:53] <yofel> ok, then someone else find out what's broken there
[12:54] <nick87720z> yofel: i did not say, that it is in kubuntu backports
[12:54] <smartboyhw> six86, run sudo apt-get update again, and try the solutions..
[12:54] <smartboyhw> nick87720z, we get it, don't worries:P
[12:54] <yofel> nick87720z: ok, no problem, but then there's not much we can do. I'll check if there's anything we can help with though
[12:56] <six86> yofel: but apt-get update does nothing new?!
[12:56] <yofel> update won't do anything if nothing was changed
[12:57] <six86> Yes, and what should i try then?
[12:58] <smartboyhw> six86, what does sudo apt-get -o Debug:pkgProblemResolver=yes install kubuntu-desktop give you? Paste it in paste.ubuntu.com

[14:00] <ladylee> its not bootable
[14:00] <ladylee> oops sorry my bad yes
[14:00] <smartboyhw> ladylee, what did you use?
[14:00] <ladylee> its the new version
[14:00] <ladylee> i used a usb

[14:01] <smartboyhw> LOL
[14:01] <smartboyhw> ladylee, I mean, what software did you use to put the image into the USB?
[14:01] <Okitain> ladylee: so, did you follow instructions from the website?
[14:01] <ladylee> theres an inbuilt software usb image writer in linux mint 15 that i used to make the bootable usb
[14:02] <smartboyhw> ladylee, I would recommend you to use dd
[14:02] <ladylee> dd?
[14:02] <smartboyhw> dd if=kubuntu-13.04-iso of=/dev/sdb
[14:02] <smartboyhw> ladylee, that's the greatest tool ever:P
[14:03] <ladylee> let me check is dexter mint has DD in its store :P
[14:03] <smartboyhw> ladylee, no
[14:03] <smartboyhw> ladylee, just type it in terminal
[14:03] <Okitain> ladylee: yes, it bloody does.
[14:03] <Okitain> IN TERMINAL.
[14:05] <ladylee> no such file or directory
[14:08] <smartboyhw> ladylee, well, of course it's the name of your image...
[14:09] <smartboyhw> dd if=<your iso> of=/dev/sdb
[14:09] <tester56> ladylee, if you have no experience with dd please be careful!
[14:09] <yofel> uhm, make bloody sure that sdb is the flash drive
[14:09] <ladylee> do u know how to format a usb on linux?
[14:10] <yofel> smartboyhw: please be careful when recommending dd to novices
[14:10] <yofel> you can do a lot of damage with it
[14:10] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK
[14:10] <ladylee> its my first laptop and first tiime using any sorta distro of linux ubuntu or kubuntu :$
[14:11] <smartboyhw> Well, maybe I should have recommended unetbootin, sorry..
[14:11] <tester56> ladylee: Then please forget dd
[14:11] <ladylee> ok
[14:11] <smartboyhw> ladylee, how did you install Linux Mint then?
[14:11] <tester56> ladylee: you want to place the iso on a usb, right?
[14:11] <ladylee> i had ubuntu 13.04
[14:11] <ladylee> on my system
[14:11] <ladylee> that i upgraded or installed
[14:12] <smartboyhw> ladylee, use Unetbootin
[14:12] <smartboyhw> sudo apt-get install unetbootin
[14:12] <smartboyhw> It's a simple GUI tool
[14:12] <smartboyhw> Much better than the usb-creator you use (it is buggy）
[14:12] <ladylee> ok
[14:12] <Zoiaguyver> usb-creator doesn't work 9/10 times (buggy is an understatement)
[14:14] <Zoiaguyver> unetbootin is the "recommended" usb program afair, dd works great aswell (if you have dd_rescue installed)
[14:14] <ladylee> true. it didnt remove the previous distro this time on the usb. it created the other files over the previous ones.
[14:14] <ladylee> hence why i couldnt boot the usb
[14:14] <ladylee> lol
[14:14] <ladylee> really an understatement :D
[14:15] <Zoiaguyver> unetbootin should give you the option to format the usb
[14:15] <Zoiaguyver> just make sure to use "fat" or "fat32" if you intend to use it in anything but linux
[14:17] <ladylee> the option has many options. which one to choose? 13.04 hdmedia?
=== jacob_ is now known as Guest76382
[14:17] <Zoiaguyver> 13.04 desktop should be there
[14:17] <smartboyhw> ladylee, you HAVE downloaded the ISO right?
[14:17] <ladylee> yes
[14:18] <smartboyhw> ladylee, there should be a place where you can select the ISO
[14:18] <Zoiaguyver> Oh if you got it already there should be a little folder button on the right hand side where you can click to find the iso
[14:20] <ladylee> it says to reformat the usb to fat32
[14:20] <ladylee> how to do that now
[14:20] <ladylee> :S
[14:21] <Okitain> ladylee: do you have gnome-disk-utility or gparted installed?
[14:21] <Okitain> If yes, then use them.
[14:22] <ladylee> it has its own utility called DISKS
[14:22] <ladylee> that has the format option
[14:25] <ladylee> installling gparted
[14:35] <ladylee> how to convert to fat32?
[14:36] <tester56> ladylee: convert what to fat32?
[14:36] <ladylee> the usb to create kubuntu bootable usb
[14:37] <tester56> use gparted or sth. similar
[14:37] <Okitain> ladylee: Run gparted, find your device, delete every partition and create one on fat32.
[14:37] <ladylee> i did remove everything
[14:38] <tester56> now make a new partition and slect fat32
[14:38] <ladylee> by removing partitions has it already converted to fat32?
[14:38] <ladylee> because it didnt give any kind of option
[14:38] <Okitain> No.
[14:39] <Okitain> Right-click on empty space, choose "make new partition", select fat32.
[14:40] <ladylee> irt says that i have gpt partition table
[14:41] <ladylee> its asking me to create an msdos partition
[14:41] <Okitain> Say yes.
[14:41] <ladylee> to the msdos partitioning?

[15:52] <foobArrr> I tried kde 4.11 yesterday because of a bugfix I was waiting for, I installed it from the kubuntu backports ppa. but after encountering a few new problems, I decided to downgrade again, I removed the ppa with ppa-purge. now after login akonadi_agent_launcher and akonadi_maildispatcher_agent together have 100% CPU
[15:52] <foobArrr> sorry, premature return
[15:54] <foobArrr> together have 100% CPU usage. the system becomes unusable after a few seconds. I made them unexecutable for now. any idea what is the cause and how to fix this? (I made backups before the upgrade, so if all else fails ...)
[15:56] <NanduX> Hey guys, does somebody have any issues with the Alpha release? I want to upgrade to try it out
[15:59] <genii> NanduX: #ubuntu+1 is probably the better place to enquire
[16:02] <genii> foobArrr: Does ~/.local/share/akonadi/akonadiserver.error or ~/.local/share/akonadi/akonadi_control.error    have anything interesting in them?
[16:04] <Alex_Zion> Hi everyone, I just upgrade to kde 4.5.11, and I cannot undestand why are changed the folder structure of my media folder , using a username folder on top of it ....
[16:05] <foobArrr> akonadiserver.error doesn't exist. akonadi_control.error: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5993252/
[16:05] <Alex_Zion> of course breaking everything was connected to any folder on media ...., thanks guys , there is a good reasons for that ?
[16:09] <Alex_Zion> can I have all my folder back where it was , would be very nice to have a system that doesn't change those things upgrading , because anytime are hours to reconfigure everithing ....
=== aLEXzION_ is now known as AlexZion
[16:16] <AlexZion> well , nobody answer , like always here , when someone just complain about something wrong , it's just a troll right .....
[16:17] <AlexZion> thanks anyway , even for all the problem you gift to me with this kind of change .....
[16:17] <BluesKaj> AlexZion, no, probly because nobody else has seen your issue before , takes a while to figure it out
[16:18] <BluesKaj> AlexZion, instant gratification isn't available here
[16:20] <AlexZion> well anyway the problem is there and is a big problem for people who works daily in kubuntu, and I hope is a problem and not a decision , because I couldn't understand it BluesKaj
[16:21] <BluesKaj> AlexZion, how can we understand it if we haven't seen it before ?
[16:22] <AlexZion> well , you should BluesKaj because all of my friend in #ubuntu-it.chat , are saying me that they have the same things on their machina ....
[16:22] <BluesKaj> if your username is is appearing in /media address bar path , then that's something new
[16:23] <AlexZion> really BluesKaj, what a good news ...., and what about all the broken link !?!, yeah , just spend few hours to fix it..., isn't right ?
[16:24] <BluesKaj> AlexZion, got a screenshot ?, let's have a look
[16:26] <AlexZion> there is nothing to have a look BluesKaj , before I had /media /Dati/AndSoOn/, now I have /media/user/Dati/AndSoOn/, so any reference to virtual hard drive, applications, files , folder sync and everything else , just doesn't works anymore ...., it is quite simple , isn't ?
[16:27] <NanduX> create a symlink
[16:27] <rudyismydog> [08:58] <tonal> smartboyhw, https://bugs.launchpad.net/kubuntu-ppa/+bug/1213072
[16:27] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1213072 in Kubuntu PPA "Kopete crash on startup: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/kde4/kopete_icq.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5Oscar6Client15connectToServerERK7QStringtbS3_7" [Undecided,New]
[16:27] <AlexZion> until when NanduX, Until someone decide they wnat a different structure ?
[16:28] <NanduX> yes, or until the apps catch up (though I don't know what apps you are talking about)
[16:29] <BluesKaj> virtual hard drive ?, are you talking about VBox or Vmware , if so that's new infornation, which might not apply to a normal install , AlexZion
[16:29] <AlexZion> is not about apps , is about everything , I mean you did changin position to important folder is not just an application problem NanduX, anyway
[16:31] <AlexZion> look BluesKaj until yesterday , I had all my 8 VM drive on a partition that today is NOT anyore there ....., and because someone else decide so ....., I don't like those things ....
[16:34] <BluesKaj> well, guess i can't help you there , perhaps if you were more direct about your problem and gave all the info we needed someone would have recognized the problem , right away , but giving bits and pieces of info in between complaints doesn't help anyone.
[16:34] <AlexZion> I mean an upgrade move abot 500 GB of my works data without I knew, and trust me , is not a funny things ....., I would like to be the onlyone  who can decide it ......
[16:35] <NanduX> AlexZion an upgrade won't move your files... I don't understand your problem but it seems that it just changed the mount point
[16:36] <AlexZion> I dont need hel to rebuild my links BluesKaj, I came here just to complaint about what seems to me a HUGE problem, I could expect something similar with win , but not in kubuntu actually ....
[16:37] <AlexZion> I dont NanduX and an Upgrade add a root folder to all my partition mounted on /media .....
[16:37] <AlexZion> so it means , that creates a folder , and than move everythig ....., I guess NanduX
[16:39] <BluesKaj> local news is on ...BBL
[16:40] <NanduX> upgrades don't do that AlexZion
[16:41] <AlexZion> ok NanduX, think what you want , but Upgrades did it in my case , and it's not fun .....
[16:44] <NanduX> I think it changed only the mount point of your partition/drive... if you want to have a static mount point you should configure it in /etc/fstab
[16:45] <AlexZion> you know NanduX, BluesKaj, I use Kubuntu for 100% of my work since 8.04 cames out, and I always trust a lot kubuntu....., but today after this problem my trust on it is suddenly drops down a lot ....
[16:46] <genii> Yes. So even if something in automounter or udev adds extra layer of directory or so on /media no update/upgrade will touch the mounts you specify in fstab
[16:46] <AlexZion> yeah NanduX, now I'll fix in some way , is not a big problem to fix , just a waste of time .....
[16:46] <NanduX> I think it is more a problem of your config rather than a kubuntu problem
[16:47] <mparillo> NanduX: Agree that #Ubuntu+1 is a good channel, but I have been running 13.10 since Alpha-1 on a live USB and in a VM since the upgrade to KDE 4.11. It has been solid for me. One little nagging item is that my KDE clock is now set to UTC in the VM. I think it has something to do with symbolic links, but it is not that big a deal for me.
[16:48] <NanduX> thanks mparillo, I'm upgrading now, I wanted to make sure of not ending with a broken boot or something similar
[16:49] <mparillo> NanduX: Oh wait: I did a clean install; not an upgrade.
[16:53] <AlexZion> yeah sure NanduX is just my problem ... :)...., while using kubuntu of course .....  :D, anyway thanka a lot for the great things of kubuntu , much less for those creative solutions .....

[22:24] <ladylee> hi
[22:24] <ladylee> i just had to get the LTS version of KUBUNTU
[22:24] <ladylee> the other one totally had bugs i guess
[22:25] <ladylee> so many errors and non working apps
[22:25] <genii> The LTS versions *are* usually better for stability.
[22:25] <ladylee> right now i am using lts 12.04 kubuntu and my issue is that i just updated my OS and now the flash on facebook aint working at all.
[22:25] <ladylee> :(
[22:26] <ladylee> before the update the flash was working just fine
[22:26] <ladylee> now it isnt
[22:27] <mtu> hi ppl. the 4.11 quantal backports PPA upgrade has totally fried my KDE4, as in it won't start. i see "no DBUS session-bus" in kdmlog. i cannot even startx into it, even though the X server is fine (no errors).
[22:31] <mtu> any ideas on how to debug further?
[22:33] <tester56> ladylee: what browser are you using?
[22:33] <tester56> ladylee: I recommend google-chrome, flash is working always there
[22:34] <tester56> mtu: startx is generally no good idea, use "sudo start lightdm" instead
[22:36] <tester56> mtu: If you have internet connection, ppa-purge should work
[22:37] <ladylee> konq i think
[22:37] <ladylee> but firefox has the same thing
[22:37] <tester56> use chrome, you will see it works as it does not use native flash
[22:38] <tester56> or downgrade the flashplayer package
[22:38] <tester56> mtu: The responsible people who have enough knowledge to help you can be found on #kubuntu-devel, but they are usually not online right now
[22:39] <mtu> tester56: thanks for the info. what does ppa-purge do?
[22:39] <tester56> mtu: removing a ppa completely and rolling back all changes
[22:39] <NanduX> ladylee do you have the package flashplugin-installer installed?
[22:39] <ladylee> i just installed 12.04 but rite after installing it asked me to update..
[22:40] <ladylee> i checked facebook before updating to know if things working alrite there
[22:40] <ladylee> so i know that it was previously working before the update
[22:40] <ladylee> how to check that
[22:40] <ladylee> im new on kubuntu
[22:40] <ladylee> i havent used linux ever
[22:41] <mtu> tester56: thanks, that might be my last resort for today. cheers, mate!
[22:41] <tester56> mtu: sudo apt-get install ppa-purge (to install ppa-purge) and sudo ppa-purge ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports to remove it
[22:41] <NanduX> ladylee open a terminal and type 'apt-get install flashplugin-installer'
[22:42] <NanduX> ladylee: 'sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer'
[22:43] <ladylee> it says the flashplugin that i have is already the newest
[22:46] <NanduX> ladylee, well, then flash is not working for some reason, as tester56 said you can install google chrome, it comes with its own flash plugin
[22:49] <ladylee> yes but its opening half the photos and half the videos and not even playing them :9
[22:49] <ladylee> :(
[22:49] <ladylee> it was fine bfore the upgrade
[22:51] <tester56> ladylee: Google-chrome is not in the official repositories as it is closed source
[22:51] <ladylee> hmm i shouldnt have updated 12.04 with new sources and pplugins :(
[22:51] <ladylee> that did it
[23:13] <nah> where can i find config file for iptables in kubuntu?
