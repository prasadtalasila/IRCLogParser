[05:19] <Tm_T> Riddell: great thing with donations (:
[06:11] <smartboyhw> Anyone here doing calligra?

[08:47] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1214298 in calligra-l10n (Ubuntu) "Please update calligra-l10n to 2.7.2" [Undecided,New]
[09:02] <smartboyhw> Anyone can review calligra and calligra-l10n existing in smartboyhw/packaging-staging-1 PPA?
[09:12] <shadeslayer> yofel: uhm, did we not take into account the HWE stack for 4.11?
[09:12] <shadeslayer> because installing the HWE stack removes kde-window-manager on precise
[09:13] <shadeslayer> ( with 4.11 )
[09:14] <yofel> I saw that, and I don't know why it happens :/
[09:14] <smartboyhw> :/
[09:14] <shadeslayer> :S
[09:15] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, the kernel stack or the graphics stack?
[09:15] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: both
[09:15] <shadeslayer> well
[09:15] <smartboyhw> BOTH!?
[09:15] <shadeslayer> kernel doesn't remove kde-window-manager
[09:15] <yofel> smartboyhw: you can't seperate those
[09:15]  * smartboyhw thought it's xorg
[09:15] <yofel> because running mixed X and kernel stacks is unsupported
[09:15] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh really?
[09:15] <yofel> yes
[09:15]  * smartboyhw checks anyway
[09:16] <yofel> it'll be mesa that's the problem
[09:16] <yofel> that's the only thing kwin uses
[09:16] <shadeslayer> yes
[09:16] <shadeslayer> I think it depends on the regular mesa package
[09:16] <shadeslayer> and that conflicts with the HWE one
[09:17] <shadeslayer> and then apt decides to remove kde-window-manager to solve it
[09:17] <shadeslayer> hm
[09:17] <shadeslayer> yofel: doesn't happen on regular precise
[09:17] <shadeslayer> oh
[09:17] <shadeslayer> thats why
[09:18] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/pbb42ec51/
[09:18] <shadeslayer> lines 4 through 11
[09:18] <yofel> looks correct to me
[09:19] <shadeslayer> no, I mean that's from 4.8.5
[09:19] <shadeslayer> and someone manually added the deps?
[09:19] <yofel> no, mesa shlibs does that I think
[09:19] <yofel> or something like that
[09:20] <yofel> wait, libgl1 is virtual I think
[09:22] <shadeslayer> I am completely unsure how this works :S
[09:24] <yofel> every mesa package provides libgl1, so you can switch them out as you want
[09:24] <yofel> the only thing you need to work out is apt's resolver behaviour
[09:25] <shadeslayer> so why is it that our PPA packages don't depend on the lts packages
[09:25] <yofel> because the lts package have the exact same shlibs depends as the archive packages
[09:25] <yofel> so nothing's different
[09:30]  * Riddell gets onto plasma-mediacentre 1.1 for the announcement
[09:33] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/p974ec6dd/ is what I have on my precise machine
[09:34] <shadeslayer> line 137
[09:37] <yofel> shadeslayer: what exactly are you installing?
[09:37] <shadeslayer> linux-generic-lts-raring xserver-xorg-lts-raring libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-raring ?
[09:42] <yofel> add at least egl to that
[09:43] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/p2e68d6e4/
[09:44] <shadeslayer> I think it's because might not be virtual?
[09:45] <shadeslayer> kubuntu@kubuntu:~$ apt-cache depends kde-window-manager | grep libgles2

[09:47] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/p2a27cf42/
[09:48] <shadeslayer> can you try that in your VM >
[09:48] <shadeslayer> ?
[09:57] <yofel> don't have it here, will try it later
[10:01] <shadeslayer> okay
[10:01]  * shadeslayer is trying in his own VM before trying out on the desktop
[10:01] <jmux> shadeslayer: I've seen this update problem to. Installing the missing lts-raring dependencies fixes the problem.
[10:01] <shadeslayer> but it'll take a good hour
[10:02] <shadeslayer> jmux: I see, cool, then I can relpy on the devel mailing list
[10:02] <jmux> If I just install with lts-raring packages I don't have any problems.
[10:02] <shadeslayer> oh
[10:03] <jmux> Just can't remember which packages were actually missing, as my repository just contains the lts-raring packages.
[10:03] <shadeslayer> sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-raring xserver-xorg-lts-raring libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-raring libegl1-mesa-lts-raring libgles2-mesa-lts-raring
[10:03] <shadeslayer> s/raring/quantal/
[10:03] <kubotu> shadeslayer meant: "sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-quantal xserver-xorg-lts-raring libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-raring libegl1-mesa-lts-raring libgles2-mesa-lts-raring"
[10:03] <shadeslayer> bleh, stops at the first instance
[10:04] <shadeslayer> anyway, jmux, try that ^^ with quantal instead of raring
[10:08] <shadeslayer> seems to work here http://paste.kde.org/p24d28a1c/
[10:14] <jmux> shadeslayer: I can't really try the update. My client installation already contains the lts-raring HWE and KDE 4.11 packages on precise.
[10:14] <shadeslayer> ah :)
[10:14] <shadeslayer> cool :)
[10:15] <jmux> This probably just works, because my repository doesn't contain any alternative packages.
[10:15] <jmux> And many thanks from Munich / LiMux for those Precise KDE 4.11 packages - saved us a lot of work!
[10:16] <shadeslayer> maybe :)
[10:16] <shadeslayer> jmux: mostly thanks to yofel :D
[10:17]  * smartboyhw asks for shadeslayer and yofel to review calligra.

[10:17] <shadeslayer> *plz
[10:18] <Riddell> smartboyhw: what's to review?
[10:18] <smartboyhw> Riddell, 2.7.2 duh
[10:18] <smartboyhw> :P
[10:18] <smartboyhw> In smartboyhw/packaging-staging-1
[10:19] <shadeslayer> Riddell: https://launchpad.net/~jr/+archive/ppa/+packages?field.name_filter=&field.status_filter=published&field.series_filter=saucy < do I need to review all nm packages?
[10:20] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: l10n is FTBFS
[10:21] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, :O
[10:21] <smartboyhw> Oh, removed language

[10:31] <shadeslayer> Riddell: probably going to take time since I have to setup a saucy VM
[10:31] <shadeslayer> or hmm
[10:32]  * Riddell publishes kubuntu.org/news/plasma-mediacentre-1.1
[10:32] <Riddell> shadeslayer: mm you're not on saucy?
[10:32] <shadeslayer> I am
[10:33] <shadeslayer> yeah, I'll just add the ppa
[10:33] <Riddell> so just install them locally
[10:33] <Riddell> it won't breaking anything :)
[10:34]  * Riddell publishes kubuntu.org/news/plasma-mediacentre-1.1
[10:37] <Riddell> yofel: ok to add 12.10 to kubuntu.org/news/kde-sc-4.11 ?
[10:38] <shadeslayer> Do we even have packages for 12.10?
[10:38] <Tm_T> uh, no qdbus in 13.04 with 4.11?
[10:39] <shadeslayer> !find /usr/bin/qdbus raring
[10:39] <ubottu> File /usr/bin/qdbus found in perlqt-dbg, perlqt-dev, qtchooser
[10:39] <Tm_T> the bin is symlink to qtchooser bin
[10:39] <shadeslayer> ah 
[10:40] <Tm_T> which tries to run bin from /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/
[10:40] <Tm_T> which isn't there
[10:40] <Riddell> Tm_T: apt-get install qdbus ?
[10:40] <shadeslayer> you want qt4-dev-tools
[10:40] <Riddell> it's a known problem that qtchooser can be installed without some binaries to confuse things
[10:40] <shadeslayer> or qtbase5-dev-tools
[10:40] <Tm_T> Riddell: done, even tried reinstalling several times
[10:41] <Riddell> dpkg -L qdbus  ?
[10:41] <Tm_T> contains /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt4/bin/qdbus
[10:41] <Tm_T> ahaaa
[10:41] <Tm_T> so qtchooser tries to run binary from wrong qt version?
[10:42] <shadeslayer> yes
[10:42] <shadeslayer> you need to export some variable
[10:43] <shadeslayer> man qtchooser
[10:43] <Tm_T> the assumption that if I install packages things just work, doesn't work here
[10:43] <Tm_T> let's see
[10:44] <yofel> Riddell: should be fine, I heard no complaints
[10:44] <yofel> shadeslayer: yes, we have packages for 12.10 now
[10:44] <shadeslayer> oh cool
[10:45] <Riddell> yofel: thanks for doing those
[10:46] <Riddell> shadeslayer: people moaned so yofel was good enough to do it, I'm still not sure why anyone is running quantal but customer knows best I guess
[10:46] <shadeslayer> ^^
[10:47] <shadeslayer> Riddell: plasma-nm is the git version of the new network manager thingy right>
[10:48] <Riddell> shadeslayer: yeah
[10:48] <Riddell> shadeslayer: along with libnm-qt and libmm-qt
[10:48] <shadeslayer> right
[10:48] <Riddell> and I need a packaging and functionality review
[10:49] <shadeslayer> Riddell: looks weird in a horizontal panel
[10:49] <Riddell> shadeslayer: how so?
[10:49] <shadeslayer> pixmap isn't scaled properly
[10:49] <Riddell> looks exactly the same as current one to me
[10:49] <Riddell> shadeslayer: screenshot?
[10:49] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, Riddell the *fixed* calligra-l10n should be in smartboyhw/packaging-staging-2 ppa
[10:50] <shadeslayer> Riddell: http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/20/plasma-desktopwH9290.png
[10:50] <shadeslayer> Riddell: oh, you probably added it to the systray
[10:50] <Riddell> that's a vertical panel :)
[10:50] <Riddell> yeah it's in my systray
[10:50] <Riddell> but it looks fine in your screenshot no?
[10:50] <shadeslayer> yes, looks weird in a horizontal screenshot as well
[10:50] <shadeslayer> nope
[10:50] <smartboyhw> Hmm, not yet
[10:51] <shadeslayer> looks bad locally
[10:51] <shadeslayer> possibly screenshot doesn't show the issue properly 
[10:51] <shadeslayer> that IM button is totally confusiong
[10:51] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[10:51] <shadeslayer> *confusing
[10:51] <shadeslayer> I associate that icon with ktp
[10:52] <shadeslayer> is it just me or both the wrench and the 'online icon' do the same thing?
[10:54] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I would propose putting it in experimental
[10:55] <Riddell> shadeslayer: IM button?
[10:56] <Riddell> shadeslayer: yes it's one big button at the bottom to show the options panel thing
[10:56] <shadeslayer> both the wrench and the online icon do the same thing http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/20/plasma-desktopCz9290.png
[10:56] <Riddell> ah you're saying the green icon is the same as telepathy connected icon, that could be confusing
[10:57] <shadeslayer> that AND clicking on either the icon and the wrench does the same thing
[10:59] <Riddell> sure, valid UI issue, we can take that back to the authors
[10:59] <Riddell> but not a killer I think
[10:59] <shadeslayer> sure
[10:59] <Riddell> I'd like to put it into saucy to get it tested for the beta and we can decide from there
[11:02] <shadeslayer> Won't having 2 network managers in the archive be confusing?
[11:04] <shadeslayer> and traditionally we've put stuff in the experimental ppa for testing
[11:05] <shadeslayer> Riddell: from a packaging POV how about dropping "Sample debian/rules that uses debhelper" lines in debian/rules ?
[11:05] <shadeslayer> ( still there in plasma-nm _
[11:07] <Riddell> shadeslayer: I'm always unsure about best practice on that, removing copyright notices seems unfair
[11:07] <Riddell> but then it's just distracting
[11:08] <Riddell> it's a small issue that doesn't matter either way so I think I'll do it
[11:08] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: can you update Qt5 in Neon5 plz
[11:10] <soee> Riddell, here at work i havent updated my system yet to KDe 4.11, now i would like to do this and this packages are marked to be removed: ktouchpadenabler kwin-style-qtcurve libaudiocdplugins4 libkdgantt2 libtaskmanager4abi3 qtcurve tasks-icons
[11:10] <soee> is it fine ?
[11:10] <shadeslayer> Riddell: then in libnetworkmanagerqt0.install maybe change the regex to usr/lib/lib*.so.0*
[11:10] <shadeslayer> so that if it breaks in the future, the package fails to build
[11:12] <Riddell> shadeslayer: if what breaks?
[11:12] <Riddell> oh the SONAME changes?
[11:12] <shadeslayer> if the so version is bumped to 1?
[11:12] <shadeslayer> yes
[11:12] <Riddell> soee: yeah that's all fine
[11:13] <shadeslayer> then we can catch it
[11:13] <soee> Riddell, and stopped: apport-kde kscreen :)
[11:13] <soee> but this i just ignore
[11:15] <shadeslayer> Riddell: no symbols for libmodemmanagerqt0 ?
[11:15] <Riddell> shadeslayer: hmm I added libmodemmanagerqt0.symbols
[11:16] <Riddell> but maybe I failed to upload it, tsk
[11:16] <shadeslayer> and same issue regarding the install file
[11:16] <shadeslayer> everything looks good otherwise
[11:20] <shadeslayer> Riddell: would be nice to have a release with translations btw
[11:20] <shadeslayer> since it's such a big user facing app
[11:22] <Riddell> shadeslayer: yes that would be essential for a more final release
[11:28] <seaLne> Riddell: in announcements about updated packages ie PMC is there a reason not to say what the package to install it is called? is this to get away from command line stuff?
[11:29] <Riddell> seaLne: hmm no, I think it's because I just copied that template from kde sc where the assumption is an update
[11:29]  * Riddell fixes

=== Evpok_ is now known as Evpok
[13:08] <Riddell> I'll look at it sometime soon
[13:09] <smartboyhw> Riddell, eh, when did we release plasma-mediacenter 1.1 to Ubuntu archive?
[13:13] <Riddell> smartboyhw: about an hour ago
[13:13] <smartboyhw> Riddell, great:)
[13:14]  * smartboyhw still wonders if Riddell have reviewed calligra for him
[13:14] <Riddell> smartboyhw: um no sorry slipped my mind, onto it now
[13:14] <smartboyhw> Riddell, don't forget, the -l10n is in my packaging-staging-2 ppa:P
[13:15] <Riddell> smartboyhw: hmm, why?
[13:15] <smartboyhw> Riddell, because the packaging-staging-1 version of -l10n failed:P
[13:15] <smartboyhw> Due to an extra package (cavalencia got killed obviously)
[13:16] <Riddell> smartboyhw: but why not delete it and upload there?  or bump version no?
[13:16] <Riddell> using a different ppa is just inelegant
[13:16] <smartboyhw> Riddell, because delete doesn't work at all (I've tried many times)
[13:16] <smartboyhw> And bumping version number makes it inelegant (for me:P)
[13:17] <Riddell> it's kinae what version numbers are there for :)
[13:20] <soee> what exactyl plamsa-mediacenter do 
[13:20] <soee> if i open it i have only window with 4 huge icons
[13:20] <soee> and thats all i cant click any of them just scroll left-right
[13:23] <smartboyhw> soee, ;O
[13:23] <soee> smartboyhw, may thi be related to: i just upgraded from 4.10.5 => 4.11 on raring but didnt reboot ?
[13:24] <smartboyhw> soee, eh, you should log out I think at least, to experience 4.11...
[13:25] <soee> smartboyhw, yeah but i didnt want to stop my work :) thats why i postponed reboot
[13:33] <Riddell> smartboyhw: wibble
[13:33] <Riddell> words(11426)/koffice (lib komain): "words" part.desktop not found. 
[13:33] <Riddell> calligrawords not running?
[13:33] <smartboyhw> Riddell, :O
[13:34] <Riddell> same for calligrasheets
[13:34] <Riddell> smartboyhw: does it work for you?
[13:34]  * smartboyhw checks
[13:35] <Riddell> it works after running kbuildsycoca4
[13:35] <Riddell> so it's a general problem
[13:35] <smartboyhw> Hmm
[13:35] <Riddell> that should run magically when installing new stuff
[13:35]  * smartboyhw didn't do anything to packaging except the libopencolorio powerpc change
[13:36] <smartboyhw> I'm currently installing here
[13:37] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ew, I have that problem too
[13:37] <Riddell> smartboyhw: fixed by running kbuildsycoca4 ?
[13:37] <smartboyhw> Riddell, NO.
[13:37]  * smartboyhw is not understanding this
[13:39] <BluesKaj> apachelogger, I'm looking for a method to configure the audio output settings for video playback on the PMC. Is there a config file available to edit ?
[13:39] <Riddell> BluesKaj: it just uses phonon, settings in system settings
[13:40] <Riddell> - libopencolorio-dev [!powerpc !armhf],
[13:40] <BluesKaj> Riddell, that's what i was afraid of :(
[13:40] <smartboyhw> Riddell, any reason that you can think of?
[13:40] <Riddell> smartboyhw: libopencolorio-dev fine on powerpc?
[13:40] <smartboyhw> Riddell, according to ScottK yes
[13:40] <smartboyhw> He did that change, not me.
[13:41] <Riddell> smartboyhw: nope I'm mystified
[13:41] <Riddell> but I can't see it being a calligra problem
[13:41]  * smartboyhw too
[13:41] <smartboyhw> Is it our own problem then
[13:41] <smartboyhw> ?
[13:42] <Riddell> smartboyhw: ok to upload?
[13:42] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I'm not sure now...
[13:43] <Riddell> smartboyhw: well nothing has changed in calligra
[13:43] <smartboyhw> Riddell, OK then, if you say so
[13:43] <smartboyhw> But this weird thing...
[13:44] <Riddell> yes, worrying
[13:45] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you planning on backporting this?
[13:45] <shadeslayer> ~np shadeslayer_
[13:46] <smartboyhw> Riddell, the problem is that if this "problem" happens to 13.04 and 12.04 users, I'm not willing to backport it.
[13:46] <smartboyhw> "problem" = kbuildsycoca4
[13:47] <Riddell> smartboyhw: if it happens in 13.04 we know it's something to do with calligra and not kdelibs
[13:47] <Riddell> but I expect it's kdelibs
[13:47] <smartboyhw> Riddell, OK
[13:48] <smartboyhw> Riddell, can you do the backport? I am a bit busy here to rush my summer homework..
[13:49] <Riddell> smartboyhw: we'll see who gets to it first :)
[13:49] <Riddell> uploaded to saucy
[13:50] <smartboyhw> Riddell, huh
[13:50] <Riddell> well I'm busy on plama-nm now and I'm away this evening so dunno if I have time either
[13:51]  * smartboyhw then nominates apachelogger or shadeslayer or yofel to do the work...
[13:51] <shadeslayer> I have a frameworks meeting to attend in 10 minutes
[13:51] <shadeslayer> then I'm done for the day

[13:53] <Riddell> shadeslayer: you keeping more normal waking hours these days?
[13:53] <shadeslayer> Riddell: ~yeah
[13:54] <shadeslayer> trying hard to
[13:54] <shadeslayer> I slip one or two hours every week, need to keep myself in check so that I don't slip too far
[13:54] <shadeslayer> I started off this week by sleeping at 2 AM
[13:55] <shadeslayer> today was not productive though :(
[13:59]  * shadeslayer hasn't watched Dr. Who in over 2 weeks :(
[14:00] <Riddell> it's not been broadcast for about 2 months?
[14:00] <shadeslayer> I was catching up on old episodes
[14:00] <shadeslayer> was watching the one where David Tenant stars as the doctor
[14:01]  * shadeslayer tries fixing QtWebkit FTBFS
[14:02] <Riddell> bonus points for the Children in Need special that is set when he regenerates as David Tennant

[14:02] <Riddell> -- ERROR: debian/control has excess language packages: calligra-l10n-cavalencia
[14:02] <smartboyhw> Riddell, is it packaging-staging-2?
[14:02] <Riddell> those pesky valencians, it's not like they even have their own language
[14:03] <Riddell> smartboyhw: aah
[14:03] <Riddell> smartboyhw: my apt-get source may have not realised that
[14:03] <Riddell> so I'll need to bump the version no anyway :)
[14:03] <smartboyhw> Weird
[14:03] <smartboyhw> ....
[14:03] <smartboyhw> Riddell, it failed in packaging-staging-2
[14:04] <smartboyhw> But I've uploaded the fixed version already, maybe I missed something (damn)
[14:04]  * smartboyhw goes back to his Maths
[14:04] <Riddell> no it's fine in packaging-staging-2
[14:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, is it?
[14:05] <Riddell> I uploaded the packaging-staging-1 version by mistake - you didn't update the version number :)
[14:05] <Riddell> https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/packaging-staging-2/+packages looks fine

[14:06] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, I never get Qt 5 dev branch to build...
[14:06] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: this is qtwebkit
[14:06] <shadeslayer> a completely different beast
[14:06] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, qtwebkit too
[14:06] <smartboyhw> I mean, the Qt 5 version
[14:06] <shadeslayer> just disable it?
[14:07] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, I want to build frameworks
[14:07] <smartboyhw> But Plasma Frameworks 2 needs qtwebkit5 (damn)
[14:07] <shadeslayer> Neon 5
[14:07] <shadeslayer> ?
[14:07]  * smartboyhw is starting to get hatred of PPAs;P
[14:07] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, anyways kde-workspace doesn't build in neon5 I think
[14:07] <shadeslayer> untrue
[14:08]  * smartboyhw checks

[14:09] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer,  project-neon5-kde-workspace 20 hours ago
[14:09] <smartboyhw> Failed to build: amd64 i386 
=== greyback|needsfo is now known as greyback|food
[14:09] <smartboyhw> I'm not wrong it seems
[14:09] <shadeslayer> probably because we needed a new Qt5
[14:09] <shadeslayer> which I uploaded an hour or so ago
[14:09] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh great:)
[14:09] <shadeslayer> also, gtg, meeting time
