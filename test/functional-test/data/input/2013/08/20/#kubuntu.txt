[07:44] <OxDeadC0de> meh, I have an install of precise that has a broken package management. I upgraded, it tried upgrading python2.7 from ubuntu3.1 to ubuntu3.2, and libpython2.7 too, but it keeps saying libpython2.7 depends on 3.1. The apt-cache policy shows both ending with 3.2, but libpython3.1 is installed. I can't seem to remove it either.

[12:54] <yahyaa> does anyone know how to install ssh in the konsole???
[12:55] <Pici> yahyaa: sudo apt-get install ssh
[12:55] <nandhu> sudo apt-get install sshd
[12:55] <nandhu> ssh is just the client
[12:56] <nandhu> you should have server thats why sshd
[12:56] <nandhu> or open ssh is required
[12:56] <Pici> No. 'ssh' is the metapackage that includes the server and the client.
[12:56] <Pici> !info ssh
[12:56] <nandhu> oh ok that pici might be correct i am sorry try it
[12:56] <ubottu> ssh (source: openssh): secure shell client and server (metapackage). In component main, is optional. Version 1:6.1p1-4 (raring), package size 1 kB, installed size 29 kB
[12:57] <yahyaa> ok I am new to this linux stuff, so do I need to install it on both machines?
[12:58] <yahyaa> so they can see each other? I am trying to file share between two laptops!
[13:00] <nandhu> file sharing you can use command scp
[13:00] <nandhu> but for better file sharring you can set up a nfs server in one machine
[13:00] <nandhu> and access it from both 
[13:01] <nandhu> google "how to install nfs and configure in ubuntu" you will get proper steps 
[13:01] <Pici> or even samba, if you have windows computers on your network that you might want to share with too.
[13:01] <yahyaa> but I am running kubuntu 13.4
[13:01] <yahyaa> tried samba but it did not work
[13:02] <yahyaa> I am just looking for the easiest and hassel free way to get this done!

[16:05] <Guest75453> I just installed kubuntu 12.04 on my Toshiba laptop. I cannot get my wireless to work. The card I have is a Realtek RTL8188CE. Can someone help me?
[16:08] <rosco_y> Would anyone recommend that I put /usr/sbin in my path?  Conversely, would anyone recommend that I NOT put it in my path?
[16:08] <rosco_y> Guest75453: is this the first time you're using this laptop?
[16:09] <yofel>  /usr/sbin is in the default PATH on ubuntu

[16:58] <viteac> Hi pals
[17:01] <bomber> My system keeps changing the time ahead 4 hours when i reboot.. It started after I did an upgrade and the local and time zone seems to be fine. I even changed the time in the bios to the correct time and it still goes ahead 4 hours. Any suggestions?
[17:10] <genii> bomber: Rightclick on time, Digital Clock Settings... Timezones from left. .... Make sure your corect timezone is checked off in the right side. ADDITIONALLY... if your hardware clock is set to your local time, make sure that below where you select the timezone, where it says "Clock defaults to", make sure that local is selected and not UTC
=== spawn57 is now known as spawn[dead]
[17:12] <bomber> thx, i had the timezone set correctly but the defaults was set to the timezone instead of local.... hopefully that fixes it....
[17:13] <bomber> I'm going to reboot anyway for a kernel upgrade. keeping my fingers crossed, been pissing me off for about a month now
[17:13] <bomber> thx again.

[22:04] <dougl> can anyone recommend a way to customize grub...       ?     ?
[22:06] <dougl> just did a distupgrade after installing a new drive with windows on it and I guess there was a kernel in the update adn when grub went auto learning it found it and configd so I can dual boot but the menu looks a little hideous...
[22:23] <oslo> bonsoir

[22:34] <ubottu> dougl: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
