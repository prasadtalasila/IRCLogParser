[07:11] <ubottu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
[07:42] <lordievader> Good morning.

[10:10] <viranch> I added the ppa:kubuntu/backports
[10:10] <viranch> but the latest upgradable version it shows is KDE 4.8
[10:14] <ikonia> viranch: no chance
[10:15] <viranch> ikonia: so I have to upgrade to later kubuntu to get later KDE?

[11:31] <ctw> Hi! A while ago I changed my keyboard layout from the command line using setxkbmap and now this is the only way I can change the keyboard layout (I used to be able to do it with the KDE keyboard indicator in the task bar). I'd love to get the functionality back to change the layout with the widget in the task bar ... any ideas what I need to do to accomplisht this?

[13:12] <nedudgi> Hi all
[13:13] <nedudgi> Anybody can help me? I am trying to do a screensaver slideshow
[13:13] <BluesKaj> hi nedudgi ,
[13:13] <nedudgi> but there is no option for it now after i upgraded only random and blank screen. The randon is nohting to choose from 
[13:13] <nedudgi> and no banners and slideshow that used to be
[13:14] <nedudgi> i searched on forums but i think i am missig something they did not include into the upgrade...
[13:14] <Guest37146> Hi guys/gals.... I want to install theh 3.10/3.11 kernels along side the official 3.8 one. can that be done?
[13:15] <Guest37146> should I do that? will future kernel official updates run over my new installation?
[13:17] <nedudgi> any idea anybody?
[13:17] <ikonia> Guest37146: why do you want non-standard kernels ?
[13:19] <Guest37146> ikonia: because I am using nouveau and having some issues with sleep/resume and nouveau guys said many improvements around these ereas where added in 3.10 3.11 
[13:19] <Guest37146> and suggested I add it along side the regular kernels
[13:19] <ikonia> I don't think you'll find those improvements
[13:20] <Guest37146> he didn't mention I have to find anything. just use this kernel to boot from and the nouveau will be OK, it's related to 3d improvements etc...
[13:20] <ikonia> there are problems around this though
[13:20] <ikonia> it's not that simple if you want to maintain your machine
[13:21] <Guest37146> hmmmmmmmmmm
[13:21] <Guest37146> well I am not sure I want to go to the propriatary driver but it seems there is no other way. I use sleep/resume extensively
[13:21] <ikonia> I think you'll find the same problems with the proptiary ones (I could be wrong though)
[13:22] <Guest37146> you are wrong. I used propriatary until now and sleep/resume works great
[13:22] <ikonia> that's great then, you have a solution until the kernel updates are filtered down or back ported 
[13:23] <Guest37146> yeah well there are reasons why I tried the nouveau drivers instead of the nvidia one but I guess no other choice.
[13:23] <Guest37146> thanks ikonia

[20:08] <yumbono> does anyone know what the bar in the middle is for? http://i.imgur.com/qdfcPV2.png
[20:08] <yumbono> it appears after ~30 seconds of idling
[20:09] <tsimpson> screen brightness level
[20:10] <yumbono> how can I disable it?
[20:10] <yumbono> Ive already set it to 10 mins in Power Management -> Energy Saving
[20:11] <tsimpson> well that's the place where it should be set
[20:11] <yumbono> it still appears after ~30 seconds
[20:12] <tsimpson> have you tried logging out and back in again after changing those settings? it shouldn't matter, but it's worth checking
[20:13] <yumbono> will try, thanks
[21:15] <Grefor> Hi all
[21:15] <yumbono> hi Grefor
[21:16] <Grefor> I want to download source code but iḿ getting an error need to have dpkg-dev package
[21:17] <yumbono> source code of what and what do you want to source code for?
[21:17] <Grefor> edit the language files, itś horribly translated
[21:18] <yumbono> which language files? of what program?
[21:18] <Grefor> Ubuntu language files dutch "language-pack-nl"
[21:19] <yumbono> well, this is the Kubuntu channel
[21:20] <yumbono> and the right way to do this is to join a translation team on launchpad
[21:20] <yumbono> zie hier: http://wiki.ubuntu-nl.org/community/Vertaalteam/welkomLP
[21:27] <Grefor> thank you
[21:27] <yumbono> np
[21:28] <Grefor> but it really makes me want to complain. why not just let people edit their own files *sighs*
[21:29] <yumbono> because if you want to edit the source code, you would have to do it every time a new program version is pushed
[21:29] <yumbono> you'd also have to compile it from source every time; its time-consuming
