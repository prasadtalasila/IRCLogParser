[00:34] <darkxst> XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP is no longer available for when gnome-settings-daemon starts up?
[00:35] <darkxst> stgraber, ^, perhaps this is due to upstart user sessions?

[06:35] <highvoltage> I received build failure notifications for edubuntu from cdimage, but there's no logs attached. I used to have a URL that I could change to still get it.
[06:35] <highvoltage> anyone happen to know what that url should look like or how to get that build log?

[09:00] <cjwatson> Or rather why empty mails got sent

[09:14] <smartboyhw> cjwatson, considering that the maintenance is only 1.5 hours, you should rather write the time down....
[09:14] <cjwatson> smartboyhw: *shrug*
[09:15] <cjwatson> better to be overly liberal in these things, people can read the announcement for more detail
[09:15] <cjwatson> I'll remove it from the topic when the window ends
[09:15] <smartboyhw> cjwatson, sure;)

[22:48] <tsimpson> ekarlso-: you'll just have to retry the build, it's a problem with the LP buildd
[22:48] <ekarlso-> tsimpson: SIGH
[22:48] <ekarlso-> that's like 15 hours waiting
[22:49] <ekarlso-> or just 5 this time..
[22:50] <tsimpson> you're not the only one a little annoyed with the situation ;)
[22:50] <ekarlso-> tsimpson: LP has too little build slaves or ?
[22:50] <ekarlso-> what about using da cloud ? ^
[22:51] <tsimpson> I don't know the exact reason, but it seems to appear on build servers randomly
[22:51] <tsimpson> LP seems to have plenty of builders though
