[11:01] <smartboyhw> Anyone care to update kdelibs 4.11.1 in Ninjas? There is a new build out (I'm busy on other stuff)
[11:17] <soee> there is already 4.11.1 ?
[11:18] <smartboyhw> soee, not yet for Raring
[11:18] <smartboyhw> We are still fixing it
[11:18] <soee> Raring or KDE ?
[11:18] <soee> thers a bigger problem with NM in Saucy i think
[11:20] <smartboyhw> soee, KDE 4.11.1 on Saucy
[11:20] <smartboyhw> soee, networkmanagement?
[11:21] <smartboyhw> What's the issue?
[11:22] <soee> NM widget i think, after upgrade on saucy it wont connect by default to any network, and the icon on panel is not loading, i have to open widget, turn off network, than turn it on again
[11:22] <soee> than it will connect
[11:24] <smartboyhw> soee, weird
[12:45] <BluesKaj> Hi all again
[14:06] <lordievader> Good afternoon.
[15:39] <smartboyhw> Riddell, you want to host http://dot.kde.org/2013/08/31/akademy-2014-call-host ?;P
[15:40]  * smartboyhw recommends that to yofel and shadeslayer too
[15:41] <shadeslayer> I am moving to spain, and Bilbao hosted the last one
[15:41] <shadeslayer> so kind of pointless to do it there again
[15:41] <shadeslayer> and the Desktop Summit was hosted in Berlin 2 years ago
[15:41] <shadeslayer> so again, too recent
[15:41] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, :(
[15:42] <shadeslayer> can't have it in India, too much travel
[15:42] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, can't have it in HK too:P
[15:42] <smartboyhw> So, no.
[15:42] <shadeslayer> I propose Finland
[15:42] <shadeslayer> jussi can host it
[15:42] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, +1
[15:42] <shadeslayer> but wait
[15:42] <jussi> +1 from me :D
[15:42] <shadeslayer> there was Akademy in Tampere 
[15:43] <smartboyhw> jussi, please apply.
[15:43] <shadeslayer> 3-4 years ago I think
[15:43] <smartboyhw> \o/ My first Debian package is sponsored (still waiting within NEW queue)
[15:43] <jussi> pfft. my place is too small
[15:44] <shadeslayer> all we need is room in your heart
[15:49] <jussi> awwww
[15:49] <smartboyhw> lol
[17:55] <shadeslayer> uffff
[17:55] <shadeslayer> pinentry is broken
[17:55] <shadeslayer> :(
[17:58] <yofel> remove ibus-qt4 and it should work again
[18:04] <shadeslayer> cool
[18:09] <shadeslayer> yofel: thoughts on https://i149035099.restricted.launchpadlibrarian.net/149035099/kiten_4%3A4.11.1-0ubuntu1~ubuntu13.10~ppa1_4%3A4.11.1-0ubuntu1~ubuntu13.10~ppa2.diff.gz?token=282da7659411f8810582587cb62976db
[18:09] <shadeslayer> ( assuming that comes up for you )
[18:09] <shadeslayer> https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ninjas/+archive/ppa/+files/kiten_4%3A4.11.1-0ubuntu1%7Eubuntu13.10%7Eppa1_4%3A4.11.1-0ubuntu1%7Eubuntu13.10%7Eppa2.diff.gz
[18:11] <yofel> nope, need my own token or I just get a 404
[18:11] <shadeslayer> try the second link
[18:12] <yofel> doesn't work either
[18:12] <shadeslayer> o_o
[18:12] <shadeslayer> ah well
[18:12] <yofel> but ack for the change for me
[18:12] <shadeslayer> okay
[18:12] <shadeslayer> tehehe : String found where operator expected at /home/buildd/.sbuildrc line 4, near "121.227.56.51 - - [01/May/2012:10:09:12 +0000] ""
[18:12] <yofel> IMO it could even be 4.*.abi1, as that's all that's relevant
[18:13] <yofel> oh come on -.-
[18:13]  * yofel is tired of broken buildd's
[18:13] <shadeslayer> hm, you're right
[18:13]  * shadeslayer fixes
[18:15]  * yofel -> dinner
[18:28] <shadeslayer> okay, I think I've fixed all of 4.11
[18:29] <shadeslayer> 4.11.1 I mean
[18:29]  * shadeslayer checks if kdelibs was reuploaded
[18:29] <shadeslayer> nope
[18:42] <shadeslayer> yofel: thoughts on that symbol rename in kde-workspace?
[18:46] <shadeslayer> and the pykde4 FTBFS
[18:47] <yofel> shadeslayer: as far as aseigo goes kde-workspace API is private (see what was written in the last libtaskmanager discussion). So dunno.
[18:47] <shadeslayer> yeah, that's what I thought as well
[18:47]  * shadeslayer pokes Eike since he probably knows more
[18:49] <shadeslayer> yofel: probably comes from 750a5b90d52a58af721d3838faa77f4bac37752e
[18:52] <yofel> 4f4290491b517ce0288aa9ea07c5885c985f6093 in KDE/4.11, no?
[18:52] <shadeslayer> ah yes
[18:53] <yofel> I'm lost on pykde4
[18:53] <yofel> akonadi changed API o.O?
[18:54] <shadeslayer> ¯\(°_o)/¯
[18:55] <yofel> :D
[18:58] <shadeslayer> maybe send an email to the packagers list?
[18:59] <shadeslayer> and whats up with okular on amd64
[18:59] <yofel> huh
[19:00]  * shadeslayer tries in pbuilder
[19:01] <yofel> I would've said kde-runtime, but that's done...
[19:02] <shadeslayer> well
[19:02] <shadeslayer> it works in pbuilder
[19:10] <shadeslayer> seems to work now
[20:05] <shadeslayer> yofel: can you run the backport script?
[20:05] <shadeslayer> or hmm
[20:05] <shadeslayer> kde-workspace is still not fixed
[20:11] <yofel> hm, plenty of red left
[20:11] <jjesse> afternoon
[20:12] <shadeslayer> after jjesse
[20:12] <shadeslayer> jjesse: I thought you were watching the football game
[20:12] <shadeslayer> or atleast twitter suggests that
[20:13] <jjesse> i am watching the football game
[20:13] <shadeslayer> :)
[20:13] <jjesse> gotta be able to rant on twitter as well right?
[20:13] <shadeslayer> haha
[20:15] <shadeslayer> enough RFC reading for tonight
[20:16]  * shadeslayer heads to bed
[20:16] <shadeslayer> night everyone :)
[20:16] <yofel> nini
[20:16] <jjesse> night shadeslayer 
[20:16] <BluesKaj> wow, dns stress this aft ...bloody ISP's alternate dns server is down , had to reset netwoking files
[20:19] <BluesKaj> don't think I'll use any recomends from my source at the ISP , unreliable .altho it's probly not his fault
[23:09] <manchicken> I could do with a heck of a lot fewer technical difficulties.
