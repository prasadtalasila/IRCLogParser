[08:24] <dholbach> particularly stuff involving the cursor
[08:24] <cjwatson> (There are weird complexities when you start thinking about how this works for PPAs.  https://code.launchpad.net/~cjwatson/launchpad/series-alias/+merge/178103 has details)
[08:24]  * dholbach asks in #ubuntu-mir
[08:25] <cjwatson> It's possible that there'll be a mirroring oddity on {archive,ports}.ubuntu.com - I'll keep an eye on it
[08:28] <darkxst> cjwatson, is it possible to add our syslinux changes now? or does it have to wait until after beta-1 freeze? https://code.launchpad.net/~darkxst/debian-cd/ug-syslinux/+merge/183028
[08:30] <cjwatson> yeah, I saw that, it should be possible, I'll need to review once I wake up a bit more :)

[08:36] <cjwatson> I considered that and decided it was madness :)
[08:36] <dholbach> cjwatson, I think I recalled something like this having the potential of causing problems :)
[08:36] <cjwatson> I dunno, maybe Laney disagrees ...
[08:37] <Laney> I don't think any of the fixes in there really matter for us

[08:38] <cjwatson> thanks!
[08:38] <dholbach> one day, somebody needs to explain to me why these uploads always trigger transitions - it sounds like this creates a bit too much work... but maybe explain it to me over a beer :)
[08:38] <cjwatson> dholbach: they don't always, but ghc is very sensitive to its abi

[08:39] <cjwatson> it might get better with ghc 7.8 and the shift to the system runtime linker
[08:39] <cjwatson> or it might not, not sure ...

[08:44] <seb128> they are blocked on that for weeks
[08:45] <seb128> dholbach, if SRU team is happy with the current branch, that fix is going part of the next SRU already
[08:45] <dholbach> gotcha
[08:45] <sil2100> dholbach, seb128: right, infinity is in the loop but still didn't have time to verify and ACK the SRU we're proposing for unity and nux
[08:45] <seb128> otherwise we are going to need to cherrypick and do a SRU
[08:45] <cjwatson> and possibly somebody should publish something to extras to see if that causes it to create a devel symlink
[08:46] <cjwatson> pitti: does ddebs.u.c need special nudging to create a devel symlink?
[08:46] <seb128> infinity, I guess you didn't have slots to review yuker-assistant for the UbuntuKylin guys?
[08:46] <cjwatson> pitti: by which I mean devel -> saucy, devel-proposed -> saucy-proposed, etc.

[13:11] <dobey> hmm
[13:12] <pitti> we just found out that the wpasupplicant crash in the autopkgtest is a regression with the recent dbus, not from NM itself
[13:13] <cyphermox> pitti: I've just been mentioning this on -release
[13:13] <Laney> why don't we want to fix dbus?
[13:13] <pitti> we certainly do
[13:13] <pitti> britney should have held back dbus for this

[13:55] <jdstrand> pitti: are you able to make a change to the apparmor configuration and the run-adt-test? (using the new dbus)
[13:55] <pitti> jdstrand: can do; let me set up the VM
[13:56] <kentb> pitti: I think we have a winner :)  Touchpad hotkey working again on Latitude 6430u.  I have an Inspiron in the lab that I'll test sometime later today, but, I expect it'll be OK.  I'll update the bug if it isn't.
[13:57] <kentb> pitti: thanks, again, for your help
[13:57] <jdstrand> pitti: thanks. what you'll want to do is adjust /etc/apparmor.d/sbin.dhclient to add "dbus bus=session," to the profile for /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-dhcp-client.action
[13:57] <pitti> kentb: thanks! could you please attach the "for e in /sys/class/input/event*; do udevadm test-builtin keyboard $e; done" with the working file?
[13:57] <kentb> pitti: will do
[13:57] <pitti> kentb: I'm interested in how that looks like (the difference with the ! flag)
[13:57] <pitti> kentb: many thanks for your patience :)
[13:57] <jdstrand> pitti: this 'sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/sbin.dhclient' before running the test
[13:58] <kentb> pitti: no problem at all.
[13:58] <ESphynx> Unity is bugged beyond all salvation, I give up!!!
[13:59] <pitti> jdstrand: at a new line at the top or bottom of the block?
[14:00] <jdstrand> pitti: anywhere in the /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-dhcp-client.action { } stanza
[14:03] <tyhicks> jdstrand: thanks for handling the dbus issue while I was gone
[14:03] <jdstrand> np
[14:03] <tyhicks> I agree that nm-dhcp-client.action need session bus access based on the denial
[14:04] <jdstrand> the question is why is it accessing the session bus, and it that makes wpasupplicant work again
[14:05] <pitti> jdstrand: running
[14:05] <pitti> jdstrand: OOI, what does bus=session mean?
[14:06] <pitti> jdstrand: the session D-BUS? (wpa_supplicant uses the system bus)
[14:06] <jdstrand> pitti: yes, that is the mystery
[14:06] <jdstrand> but look at this denial in the jenkins syslog:
[14:06] <jdstrand> Aug 29 18:17:54 autopkgtest dbus[8876]: apparmor="DENIED" operation="dbus_method_call"  bus="session" name="org.freedesktop.DBus" path="/org/freedesktop/DBus" interface="org.freedesktop.DBus" member="Hello" mask="send" pid=9018 profile="/usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-dhcp-client.action" peer_profile="unconfined"
[14:06] <pitti> I saw one denial for some GetProperties, but I think that has always been there
[14:07] <pitti> ah
[14:07] <pitti> that's more interesting
[14:07] <jdstrand> bus="session"
[14:07] <jdstrand> we already have sub="system" via the dbus abstraction in the profile. but session is weird
[14:08] <jdstrand> there are a couple of references to DBUS_BUS_SESSION in network-manager source
[14:08] <tyhicks> the apparmor code added to dbus that generates that denial message takes the bus type right off of the message
[14:08] <pitti> cyphermox, jdstrand: indeed that fixes it
[14:08] <jdstrand> but not nm-dhcp-client.action specifically (according to cyphermox)
[14:08] <jdstrand> man, that is weird
[14:09] <jdstrand> pitti: are you doing any deep magic to make the tests not use the system bus or something?
[14:09] <pitti> jdstrand: well, it uses dbus-launch to launch a private bus to do the testing on
[14:10] <pitti> and pretends it was the system bus
[14:10] <jdstrand> tyhicks: ah, that would do it I bet
[14:10] <pitti> so that could be it
[14:10] <tyhicks> yes, definitely
[14:10] <tyhicks> dbus-launch launches a session bus
[14:10] <cyphermox> jdstrand: pitti: I'm absolutely convinced nm-dhcp-client.action doesn't ever use the session bus.. though happy to be proven wrong
[14:10] <cyphermox> gah
[14:10] <pitti> cyphermox: well, it does in these tests
[14:10] <cyphermox> yeah, I guess
[14:10] <cyphermox> it's still a mystery why this affects wpasupplicant in any way
[14:10] <pitti> export DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=`dbus-launch` (not literally, but in spirit)
[14:10] <jdstrand> pitti: do you have the ability to update the apparmor profile via the autopkgtests?
[14:10] <pitti> because everything happens on that bus
[14:11] <cyphermox> but it seems to me like the wpasupplicant issue is just a coincidence
[14:11] <pitti> jdstrand: yes, this runs as root, so it can do everything it wants to
[14:11] <tyhicks> well you can feed a bus config file to dbus-launch
[14:11] <pitti> jdstrand: can I do that in a separate file somehow, or apply seddery to that profile?
[14:11] <tyhicks> I wonder what would happen if you gave it a system bus config file
[14:12] <jdstrand> pitti: you could append "bus=session," to abstractions/dbus
[14:13] <jdstrand> pitti: but tyhicks suggestion might be more interesting and real world
[14:13] <pitti> tyhicks: I guess that would be most elegant; not sure whether one can do that as user, but I'll try
[14:13] <pitti> (that's done by python-dbusmock)
[14:13] <tyhicks> ah
[14:14] <jdstrand> cyphermox: it is interesting that wpasupplicant is the grumpy one when nm-dhcp-client.action gets the denial, isn't it?
[14:15] <jdstrand> pitti: so, at this point is the ball in your court?
[14:15] <pitti> jdstrand: yes; I'll try tyhicks' suggestion with passing a config to dbus-launch, and if that doesn't work do the profile seddery
[14:15] <cyphermox> jdstrand: quite
[14:15] <jdstrand> pitti: cool, thanks! :)
[14:15] <pitti> tyhicks, jdstrand: thanks for pointing this out! that was quite surprising
[14:15] <tyhicks> thanks pitti - ping me if you need anything
[14:16] <cyphermox> especially for some piece of code that shouldn't ever ever be touched, since it's support for new stuff we don't test yet, and almost nobody has support for
[14:16] <jdstrand> cyphermox: I'll leave that to your curiosity then :)
[14:16] <cyphermox> jdstrand: heh, I'll debug this on monday
[14:16] <cyphermox> we're probably just unlucky there, or lucky that it's showing a real bug we'd eventually hit
[14:17] <pitti> kentb: "keyboard: updating force-release list with '140,158,369-370,140,158'
[14:17] <pitti> kentb: ah, that's what I was expecting, thanks
[14:20] <kentb> pitti: ok. cool. I saw that myself.  Glad it helped you out!
[14:28] <pitti> tyhicks: how does it decide whether it's the system or session bus? does it ask the process "what are you", or does it check uid, etc?
[14:29] <tyhicks> pitti: what do you mean by "it"? dbus-launch or the apparmor mediation code that I added to dbus?

[14:32] <diwic> the eternal fight between good and bad it seems like!
[14:33] <pitti> tyhicks: nevermind; specifying a config file with  <type>system</type> works fine
[14:34] <tyhicks> ah, yeah - that's all there is to it
[14:34] <pitti> tyhicks: splendid, I'll fix that in python-dbusmock and try to squeeze it through the freeze (it's not seeded, so should be fine)
[14:34] <tyhicks> thanks pitti :)
[14:34] <pitti> tyhicks: thanks to you, too
[14:44] <dobey> can anyone reject/delete/whatever ubuntuone-credentials-13.07-0ubuntu1 from the saucy NEW upload queue?
[14:48] <seb128> dobey, done
[14:49] <dobey> thanks
[14:49] <dobey> doh
[14:49] <dobey> seb128: you rejected the 13.08 upload, not 13.07 :-/
[14:50] <seb128> dobey, crap
[14:50] <seb128> dobey, let me fix that
[14:50] <Laney> now he gets to review from rejected ;-)
[14:50] <dobey> heh
[14:50] <Laney> (you can accept from rejected)
[14:50] <seb128> Laney, yeah :/
[14:51] <pitti> yeah, just not put back into NEW :/
[14:51] <Laney> seb128: or get the uploader to reupload :P
[14:51] <seb128> Laney, that's ok, I just need to find a nitpick to justify the reject
[14:51] <dobey> what? the package is *perfect* :)
[14:51] <pitti> "badly worded package description"
[14:52] <dobey> "package description not in french"
[14:52] <pitti> tyhicks, jdstrand, cyphermox: ok, new python-dbusmock uploaded with the "pretend harder to be a system bus"; that's certainly the least place I would have expected a dbusmock bug to live :)
[14:53] <jdstrand> hehe, thanks! :)

[14:53] <pitti> "Jenkins Fixed - saucy-adt-mysql-5.5" -- OH MY OH MY OH MY!

[14:54] <jamespage> pitti, just doing my QA catchup
[14:54] <pitti> jamespage: so you managed to fixed that one in two gazillion tests that was always failing?
[14:54] <jamespage> pitti, yep
[14:54] <seb128> dobey, current convention (from kenvandine) is qtdeclarative5-<importname><version> ... it makes different versions co-installable
[14:54] <dobey> seb128: is that new? i named it based on what existing plugins were named
[14:54] <jamespage> the test executor was being called with a trailing / on one of the parameters
[14:54] <pitti> jamespage: OOI, for legitimate stderr (if that cannot be sensibly suppressed), there is now "Restrictions: allow-stderr"
[14:54] <seb128> dobey, relatively new yes, the recent packages use that
[14:54] <jamespage> pitti, yeah - I spotted that
[14:55] <dobey> seb128: but existing ones haven't been updated?
[14:56] <seb128> dobey, no, we decided it wasn't worth transitioning all the existing one, we try to respect the new convention for new packages though

[14:59] <smoser> can i get an archive admin to nack my upload to precise-proposed of ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring_2013.08.23~12.04.1.dsc
[14:59] <smoser> the changelog didn't hvae a bug reference.
[14:59] <seb128> dobey, it's a bit suboptimal that you have /usr/share files in the lib binary as well, it means that if the soname change the versions are not going to be co-installable
[15:00] <dobey> seb128: infinity was insistent on a security review, that sarnold i think is going to do, as well. i don't know if we want to block on putting it in universe for that or just block having it on the touch image
[15:00] <seb128> dobey, security reviews don't happen in NEW usually
[15:00] <seb128> rather before MIR/seeding
[15:00] <stgraber> smoser: which one?
[15:00] <seb128> we have plenty of code with unsecure code in the archive I'm sure
[15:01] <dobey> seb128: yeah, but this was being seeded to touch from universe so infinity thought we should get it done now
[15:01] <dobey> also since the previous upload had been sitting there for a month with not being accepted into the archive :-/
[15:01] <seb128> dobey, ok, then just fix the stuff I reupload and we can wait for the security review to happen
[15:01] <smoser> stgraber, the precise one without a bug in the chagnelog
[15:01] <stgraber> smoser: done
[15:01] <smoser> if you want you just delete both precise-prposed and i re-upload the righ tone.
[15:02] <seb128> dobey, but I'm happy to accept it as well
[15:02] <smoser> thanks. so there should be one there, right?
[15:02] <smoser> thanks stgraber
[15:02] <stgraber> smoser: yep, I kept the one with the bug reference
[15:03] <dobey> seb128: might be better to just accept it into universe too. i'll be on holiday all next week, and we need to get this into the touch image asap

[16:03] <danjared> xnox: I thought we were still undecided about combining suspend and hibernate into one
[16:08] <slangasek> danjared: towards the end of the session, I think we had good consensus that we wouldn't expose hibernate as a separate UI option, it should be handled transparently underneath
[16:08] <xnox> danjared: well the design from 2007 for ubuntu, finally have the technology to implement it =) and since then people were towards the idea of a single button "suspend" which will "hibernate" after a timeout, which one can twiddle in settings - zero timeout, X minutes, hours, never.
[16:09] <danjared> slangasek: I'll have to rewatch the session, but I certainly wasn't of that opinion :)
[16:09] <xnox> danjared: so everyone has suspend, and those with rapid start can have suspend+timeout->hibernate.
[16:10] <xnox> danjared: our usability tests in the past showed that people have no idea what the difference between the two is =)
[16:10] <danjared> I think there's still value in being able to put your system into a ~0 power state immediately without having to shutdown (and therefore lose state)
[16:10] <xnox> danjared: what's your preffered default timout? as per intel 1h, or instant?
[16:11] <danjared> (alternatively, having to go temporarily change settings)
[16:11] <xnox> danjared: in practice how much power is used to do 1h of sleep?
[16:11] <slangasek> danjared: does the firmware even *let* us initiate an irst hibernate from the OS?
[16:12] <slangasek> and yeah, what xnox said re: usability
[16:13] <xnox> slangasek: no, you can set timout to zero & sleep. Such that on boot/resume we need to reset the timer back to the default value as far as I can tell from the specs and Windows UI to control this.
[16:14] <slangasek> ah
[16:15] <danjared> xnox: unsure, but it lets me do things like hibernate immediately and swap out my battery without plugging in
[16:15] <xnox> cool.
[16:16] <danjared> slangasek: right, you get to set the timer to zero but leave iRST on, so right when the system goes into S3, the firmware wakes it back up and hibernates
[16:16] <xnox> danjared: i wasn't sure how to prevent iRST despite having the partition and et al. The guide suggested to format / remove the iRST partition =/
[16:17] <xnox> unless I missed that somehow.
[16:17] <danjared> xnox: I .... actually did a more extreme version of that a couple days ago where I went into iRST hibernate then disassembled my laptop to replace the keyboard (which I had spilled something on and rendered some keys non-functional). once it was back in one piece, I reassembled, thawed, and continued on
[16:18] <xnox> .................. danjared i'm not sure we user test that scenario, most of the people we get for user-testing do not bring spare keyboards and toolkits to perform laptop surgeries =)
[16:19] <danjared> xnox: sure, I'm just giving an anecdote there. the "swap out battery" case is the more salient one :)
[16:19] <xnox> danjared: at one point we had a design where the shutdown dialog has options drop-down to e.g. bypass UEFI fastpath, and that could have had "hibernate" instantly.
[16:20] <xnox> danjared: i'm still testing normal hibernate here locally & will be formatting my new laptop with iRST partition in a moment. But if it's quick enough, I'd be inclined to have the default timeout zero.
[16:20] <xnox> danjared: would that be better?
[16:20] <danjared> xnox: if you want to temporarily disable iRST, you set the first bit of SFFS to 0: http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/26022.html
[16:21] <xnox> danjared: =) i wonder if I should package mjg59 blog as manpages.
=== zyga is now known as zyga-afk
[16:22] <danjared> xnox: a drop-down dialog that lets you hibernate immediately seems fine to me.
[16:22] <danjared> xnox: you could always ask him :)
[16:24] <danjared> if the difference between sleep and hibernate is confusing, maybe hibernate could be renamed to "power off (save session)" or something similar
[16:25] <xnox> danjared: i googled for SFFS and google offered me some intel confidential driver specs =)
[16:25] <xnox> \o/
[16:25] <danjared> yeah, I noticed that many of their intentionally public documents still say that
[16:26] <xnox> danjared: no, we removed it =) we have: <list of users to switch to>, log out,  suspend, restart, shut down.
[16:27] <xnox> and it would not be compelling to re-introduce hibernate, as it was very very unreliable, failed to resume, was confusing with suspend.
[16:27] <danjared> right, I meant if you are adding a down-down
[16:27] <xnox> "drop down"
[16:27] <danjared> that too. it's still early for me :)
[16:27] <xnox> yeah, that drop down existed before unity OSD type shutdown.
[16:28] <danjared> so, I thought "hibernate" is still an option for OEM systems
[16:28] <danjared> (we'd like to keep that)
[16:28] <xnox> danjared: http://askubuntu.com/questions/94754/how-to-enable-hibernation
[16:29] <xnox> danjared: so default policikit file in Ubuntu disables hibernate, users can enable it. And/or OEMs may do that as well, if they wish.
[16:29] <danjared> right, sorry, I should have been clear that I am thinking in the context of OEM installs where we've tested hibernate enough to back using it
[16:29] <xnox> danjared: once enabled, the UI magically offers hybernate.
[16:30] <danjared> I mean that, when the hibernate option is made available, it should default to using iRST to immediately hibernate a system instead of using Linux's software hibernate
[16:31] <xnox> danjared: no, as Linux's software hibernate works with full disk encryption using LUKS, and iRST doesn't.
[16:31] <danjared> xnox: and you can work around that by reverting to Linux's hibernate if software disk encryption is used
[16:32] <xnox> danjared: and we care about user privacy & security, especially when they went to lengths to enable full disk LUKS encryption (a single checkbox)
[16:34] <xnox> danjared: i'm un convinced, but then again I don't drive, ubuntu system user design either. mpt, what do you think - should hibernate option be exposed to the users, if we can guarantee that it's reliable?
[16:36] <xnox> danjared: Linux's software hibernation will not be exposed as "hibernation" by default (but one can twiddle policy kit to enable it). Exposing zero timout iRST as hibernate is an option which could go in.
[16:36] <danjared> I mean, you're using disk encryption as a criterium for whether iRST is enabled anyway, and hibernate is exposed to users buying from an OEM
[16:37] <xnox> danjared: and at oem-config first screen they can tick "encrypt my home directory" on OEM preinstalled machine.
[16:38] <danjared> correct. if they do that, iRST can be disabled
[16:40] <xnox> it would be sad, UI wise, that enabling encryption makes hibernate button disappear, unless of course OEM provided big enough swap and validated / enabled Linux's hibernation as well.
[16:40] <xnox> (with and without user home directory encryption, which does LUKS encryption of swap upon activation)
[16:41] <danjared> we currently validate Linux's hibernation. it's part of the certification, IIRC
[16:41] <xnox> danjared: as OEM you certainly have enough toggles to enable everything =) and it would be hard to remove toggles.
[16:42] <danjared> okay, sure. as long as the toggles are there still
[16:42] <mpt> xnox, the menu I showed you this morning was like danjared is describing: "Immediately" was sleep=hibernate, "Never" was don't hibernate.
[16:43] <xnox> mpt: sure, but danjared implies that as a user i want to have: sleep (eventually hibernate) button and hibernate-now button (i want to unplug my lapto battery). Directly in the UI, without changing the default.
[16:43] <mpt> xnox, but I like the idea that if encryption is on then you get the software hibernate instead.
[16:44] <xnox> mpt: i doubt we will enable back software hibernation by default across the board, it was disabled because OEMs validated it to be unreliable and not meeting expectations.
[16:45] <xnox> mpt: but it looks like on danjared's laptops it will be wonderful =)
[16:45] <mpt> What proportion of OEM installs have working hibernate? 10%? 20%? 80%?
[16:46] <danjared> kentb: double-checking, we test hibernate as part of OEM validation, right?
=== gavin__ is now known as gavinguo
[16:50] <xnox> danjared: http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201202-10556/ "Hibernate may not function on this system"
[16:51] <mpt> So we have {iRSTable, software-hibernatable, software-unhibernatable, software-mysterious} × {encrypted, unencrypted with the necessary partition, unencrypted without the necessary partition}?
[16:51] <mpt> That's 12 combinations
[16:52] <danjared> xnox: that certification isn't for a factory install. the factory install certifications are a bit different and have a different logo there
[16:52] <mpt> though probably several of them can be combined
[16:52] <xnox> danjared: correct.
[16:53] <danjared> xnox: here's a weird one that demonstrates that: http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201208-11536/
[16:53] <mpt> xnox, could you make a table along those lines, with approximate percentages of each if you know them? That way we'll have a better idea what we're designing for.
[16:53] <mpt> Then I can come back next week and knock out designs for them.
[16:54] <xnox> mpt: in practice thought the second portion is {software encryption used, software encryption is not used}.
[16:54] <mpt> xnox, by "the necessary partition" I meant the necessary partition for either iRST or software hibernation. (They both need an extra partition, right?)
[16:56] <xnox> mpt: sure, but your way some combinations are impossible combinations. =)
[16:56] <mpt> good
[17:01] <sarnold> dobey,seb128, I've started reviewing the 13.08-0ubuntu1 version of ubuntuone-credentials; I'm liking what I'm seeing, I expect to finish it quickly.
[17:02] <dobey> sarnold: great. thanks!
[17:02] <sarnold> Laney: ooh cool :)
[17:06] <kentb> danjared: yes. we do.  It is turned on on the OEM images
[17:07] <kentb> danjared: not a certification blocker but it is tested and noted in the certification if there are issues with it.
[17:10] <Whoopie> debfx: yeah, saw it. Thanks a lot!
[17:11] <Whoopie> debfx: to be honest, the vnc extension is not very stable. but it's good to get more feedback.

[18:10]  * xnox is not quite sure what's broken
[18:16] <infinity> tjaalton: Why do my drm lockups not produce crash reports anymore?
[18:17] <infinity> tjaalton: Did you decide you didn't want all my i915 bugs? :P
[18:23] <tjaalton> infinity: heh, when was the last time they produced lockups?
[18:24] <infinity> tjaalton: Today and yesterday.
[18:24] <tjaalton> erm I mean crash reports
[18:25] <infinity> tjaalton: Err, not sure.  Back when I had those frequent hangs in... Q?  R? ... I used to reboot and have a ton of apport popups to cope with.
[18:25] <tjaalton> ah, could be a change in xdiagnose then
[18:25] <infinity> tjaalton: Not having those is certainly more friendly, but not having anything reported is a bit less handy. :)
[18:25] <infinity> tjaalton: Anyhow, drm on my sandybridge sucks again.  I blame you.
[18:25] <tjaalton> well it might just be the same bug all the time
[18:26] <tjaalton> yeah, upstream was hopeful of a patch fixing it, and it worked for some but then upstream reproduced it again..
[18:26] <infinity> At least it's different from the Q/R issues I had. :)
[18:27] <infinity> tjaalton: I assume you're talking about these: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6045137/
[18:27] <infinity> tjaalton: (Which sometimes recover, like above, and sometimes hard lock and force me to reboot... I assume it's the same bug either way, but a bit hard to tell for sure the cause of the reboot ones)
[18:28] <tjaalton> the one with i915.semaphores=0 workaround
[18:28] <tjaalton> but sounds like your bug could be in mesa instead
[18:28] <infinity> tjaalton: Well, if the one you're talking about is the Q/R lockups, this is definitely different.  And very new.
[18:29] <infinity> I've never seen this before yesterday.
[18:29] <infinity> Could be mesa9.2's fault.
[18:29] <tjaalton> file a new bug against x-x-v-intel and attach i915_error_state
[18:29] <tjaalton> yeah
[18:29] <tjaalton> it's been happy on my lappy for a week
[18:29] <tjaalton> snb
[18:30] <infinity> My reproduction method has, so far, been to play video in mplayer with the -vo gl renderer.
[18:30] <tjaalton>   * debian/xdiagnose.udev: Disable gpu apport hook for raring release
[18:30] <infinity> Haven't tried xv yet.
[18:30] <tjaalton> so you could hack that to report crashes again
[18:30] <infinity> It soft locked about 4 times in the course of a 2h movie last night, and had locked once.
[18:31] <infinity> s/had/hard/
[18:31] <tjaalton> hmm this is why we haven't been getting any bugs during saucy :P
[18:31] <tjaalton> other than the usual xserver crashes
[18:32] <tjaalton> xdiagnose is basically orphaned since bryce left
[18:32] <tjaalton> mlankhorst: ^ maybe you should adopt that one too ;)
[18:33] <mlankhorst> tjaalton: ah :P
[18:33] <tjaalton> maybe enable it until release-ish
[18:33] <mlankhorst> tjaalton: bit late in the cycle for that, though..
[18:33] <tjaalton> well, now is the time when people start upgrading en masse
[18:34] <tjaalton> or after beta
[18:34] <tjaalton> still nearly two months until release
[18:34] <mlankhorst> tjaalton: I won't be able to look at it until monday, but I'll add it to my list
[18:34] <tjaalton> sure, no rush
[18:38] <slangasek> chiluk: curl accepted.  Now, what happens if someone happens to pull the new version of apt from -updates without explicitly pulling in the new version of curl?  Will that regress existing uses of apt-transport-https?
[18:39] <slangasek> chiluk: if so, it seems to me that apt should have a hard-coded versioned runtime dependency on the fixed libcurl; and the build-dependency actually looks superfluous to me
[18:39] <chiluk> slangasek, it will be fine because apt statically links with the curl libs.
[18:39] <infinity> slangasek: I would hope there's a binary dependency.
[18:39] <chiluk> afaik
[18:39] <infinity> Err, it does what now?
[18:40] <slangasek> chiluk: it does not
[18:40] <infinity> (base)adconrad@cthulhu:~$ ldd /usr/lib/apt/methods/https | grep curl
[18:40] <infinity> 	libcurl-gnutls.so.4 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl-gnutls.so.4 (0x00007f46995e9000)
[18:40] <slangasek> infinity: there's a binary dependency on libcurl; but not on the new SRUed version of curl, which doesn't change abi and therefore doesn't change shlibs
[18:40] <chiluk> nuts.. i stand corrected
[18:40] <infinity> slangasek: Did this introduce a header change?  If not, the build-dep is indeed pointless.
[18:41] <slangasek> infinity: nopers
[18:41] <infinity> Yeah, so the build-dep should be a binary dep.
[18:41] <chiluk> i assumed that since I only found a build-dep that's all that needed updating.
[18:41] <chiluk> i stand ashamed.
[18:41] <infinity> Or that curl should have a shlibs bump.
[18:42] <slangasek> chiluk: so I think these apt uploads in the queue should be rejected, I'll do that now.  Do you understand what you need to change for the reupload?
[18:42] <chiluk> yeah... add a depends on the new version of curl for apt.
[18:42] <chiluk> not a builddep
[18:42] <chiluk> I'll revert the builddep line back to the previous version
[18:43] <slangasek> for apt-transport-https, specifically (which is probably what you meant, but just to be explicit)
[18:43] <chiluk> yeah.
[18:44] <slangasek> chiluk: and the binary package to depend on appears to be libcurl3-gnutls, which the version set to the SRU version of curl in the corresponding pocket - so different for each
[18:44] <infinity> apt-transport-https is just pulling its curl dep from shlibs currently.
[18:44] <slangasek> yes
[18:44] <slangasek> so we want to hard-code an override for that in debian/control
[18:44] <chiluk> slangasek, right.
[18:44] <infinity> So, why not just fix this in curl's shlibs?
[18:44] <slangasek> because it's not a shlib issue
[18:45] <slangasek> it's an "apt will do broken things if running with a version of curl that has this particular bug" issue
[18:45] <dobey> i take it a build in -proposed being in depwait on powerpc will block the package being migrated to release?
[18:45] <infinity> dobey: It will if the binary previously existed on PPC.  Which package?
[18:45] <dobey> infinity: ubuntuone-credentials
[18:45] <infinity> Then no.  That's a new package.
[18:45] <chiluk> I agree that the dependency should be explicit in apt-transport-https and not shlibs... because this is exacerbated by apt
[18:46] <infinity> dobey: It just needs someone to process the other three arches from binary NEW.  I'll look at 'em now.
[18:46] <dobey> ubuntu-ui-toolkit isn't built on powerpc, and ubuntuone-credentials has a build-dep on a package from ubuntu-ui-toolkit, so it won't build on powerpc. but i don't see why a) ubuntu-ui-toolkit isn't builting on powerpc or b) why ubuntuone-crednetials is trying to
[18:46] <dobey> ah ok
[18:46] <dobey> thanks
[18:47] <cjwatson> not building on an architecture is only a problem for proposed-migration if there are currently binaries for that architecture in the release pocket.
[18:47] <infinity> dobey: ubuntu-ui-toolkit probably isn't building on PPC cause it needs qt5declarative, which needs v8, which isn't ported to anything other than x86 and ARM.
[18:47] <infinity> Because Google are muppets.
[18:47] <infinity> And Qt upstream are even bigger muppets for choosing a JS engine that only exists on 1.5 architectures. :P
[18:47] <slangasek> infinity: you coulda had a V8
[18:48]  * sarnold smacks forehead
[18:48] <slangasek> infinity: alas, this means that quantal still doesn't have the backported fix for auto-cleaning of stale kernels... so maybe you want to sponsor chiluk's next apt? :)
[18:49] <infinity> slangasek: I thought we'd decided to only bother backporting that to the LTS.
[18:49] <infinity> slangasek: But we can certainly do Q too.
[18:50] <chiluk> man, I didn't expect apt to build into separate binaries like that.... sorry bout that guys... I still think it's retarded instead of linking to libs..
[18:51] <slangasek> infinity: well, apparently you uploaded 0.9.7.5ubuntu5.3 in January or something to fix it in Q, then it was superseded by a security upload, then bdmurray included the change in his latest sponsored upload
[18:51] <infinity> slangasek: Oh, hrm.  Sure.  I'll take your word for it.  That was another lifetime ago. :)
[18:51] <slangasek> chiluk: apt is a low level component of the system, apt-transport-https is an optional component with significant added dependencies; the binary split is necessary to avoid a) bloating the system, b) breaking bootstrapping
[18:52] <infinity> dobey: Accepted.
[18:52] <chiluk> slangasek, ah.. thanks.... sometimes knowing the reason makes things less insane.
[18:54] <chiluk> slangasek infinity does order matter on the Depends: line for precedence ?
[18:54] <slangasek> nope
[18:54] <dobey> infinity: thanks again
[18:54] <slangasek> chiluk: not unless it's an ORed dependency
[18:54] <slangasek> (which should not be the case here)
[18:55] <infinity> dpkg-gencontrol should be smart enough to collapse the dep from dpkg-shlibdeps and the manual dep from debian/control into the single higher one anyway.
[18:56] <slangasek> it is
[18:56] <infinity> (But even if it's not, you just have two harmless deps that say "foo (>= 1), foo (>= 2)", which obviously reduces to "you need higher than 2")
[18:56] <slangasek> at least for the releases we're talking about
