[01:53] <smartboyhw> -.-
[02:07] <mparillo> smartboyhw: Thank you for updating my bug report. Riddell suggested adding Saucy-Proposed. I can see Saucy, but not Saucy-Proposed. Do you know how to add that?
[02:08] <smartboyhw> mparillo, ah, he means enabling saucy-proposed in Ubuntu archive
[02:08] <smartboyhw> There should be some settings in Muon
[02:09] <mparillo> Oh, I thought that was adding something to the Launchpad bug report. Will Saucy-Proposed get me a newer version of qtwebkit than the daily builds of 13.10?
[02:09] <smartboyhw> mparillo, probably
[02:09] <mparillo> Thank You, I will check it you.
[02:12] <mparillo> BTW, did your fonts (assuming you keep all defaults) seem to get uglier in 13.10 in the last 24 hours or so?

[06:45] <debfx> aren't we in feature freeze?
[06:48] <smartboyhw> debfx, hmm, I want an FFe for this I think
[06:48] <smartboyhw> The main improvement for this release is the ability to compile and use oxygen-gtk on Windows (TM).  -.-
[06:48] <smartboyhw> BAH
[06:50] <smartboyhw> For the gtk3 version, it is also possible to use oxygen for non X11 backend, such as broadway
[06:50] <smartboyhw> ^ this is important
[07:01] <smartboyhw> So, I will apply for FFe for oxygen-gtk3 ONLY
[07:04] <smartboyhw> DAMN, can't provide a pbuilder log (my pbuilder-dist can't download 5 packages specifically)
[07:04] <smartboyhw> Wonder where are they lost in the ether)
[07:06] <smartboyhw> Can anyone tell me how to go into a pbuilder-dist pbuilder?

[08:27] <Riddell> smartboyhw: did your consultation come up with an answer about ppc?
[08:27] <smartboyhw> Riddell, probably, um, yep: I have faced too much opposition, I can't cancel:P
[08:27] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I will tell phillw our decision:P

[08:30] <Riddell> why does firefox want to open PDFs in krita?
[08:31] <valorie> I seed all the *buntu isos, current and the last LTS -- the PPC ones do get requests
[08:39] <Riddell> crazyness
[08:40] <valorie> some people keep old boxes for nearly ever
[08:40]  * smartboyhw thinks old boxes should all be dumped
[08:40] <valorie> dad has it, then kids get it, then grandma
[08:40] <valorie> etc.
[08:42]  * smartboyhw hates old boxes as he said
[08:42] <smartboyhw> Low RAM, Low GB, Low of everything
[08:42] <smartboyhw> Low of energy, even
[08:42] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I need somebody to upload oxygen-gtk3 for me then
[08:46] <yofel> there's some truth in there as I can't install a current ubuntu on my OLD IBM PC 300 anymore. CPU doesn't support the used instruction set. Lets see for how long ubuntu wants to keep PPC support going
[08:47] <smartboyhw> yofel, Ubuntu itself dumped it already...
[08:47] <smartboyhw> Just Lubuntu and Kubuntu continuing to want that.
[08:48] <yofel> well, our position is that we'll keep it as long as we can get the iso's tested. Otherwise we need a discussion whether to drop PPC from the archive completely
[08:49] <yofel> might make sense post 14.04
[08:49] <smartboyhw> yofel, huh, I think that will have to wait till Linux kernel itself drops support
[08:49] <smartboyhw> If not, the Lubuntu guys will fire at us
[08:50] <yofel> Linux kernel still theoretically supporty my old IBM box, but ubuntu uses incompatible compiler setting
[08:50] <yofel> s
[08:52] <Riddell> smartboyhw: where can I find it?
[09:06] <smartboyhw> Riddell, in smartboyhw/packaging-staging-1 ppa
[09:26] <Riddell> smartboyhw: uploaded!
[09:27] <smartboyhw> Riddell, thanks!
[10:14] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/07/18/%23kubuntu-devel.html you can't compile qt5 right?
[10:14] <smartboyhw> That's what I'm facing still now:I
[10:17] <yofel> smartboyhw: it works in neon5, so I guess you're missing something?
[10:17] <smartboyhw> yofel, that's what I'm wondering too
[10:17] <yofel> apt-get build-dep project-neon5-qt5 ?
[10:18] <yofel> qtwebkit is seperate
[10:21] <smartboyhw> yofel, what does pkg-project-qt5-tools consist of?
[10:21] <smartboyhw> All the build-deps are satisfied it seems
[10:22] <yofel> you mean pkg-project-neon5-tools ?
[10:22] <yofel> That's just the buildsystem and some deps
[10:22] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK...
[10:23] <yofel> smartboyhw: so back to root, what's the actual issue you're facing?
[10:23] <smartboyhw> yofel, look in the log
[10:23] <smartboyhw> http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/07/18/%23kubuntu-devel.html
[10:23] <smartboyhw> Exact issue shadeslayer faced on that day
[10:23] <yofel> oh, sql
[10:23] <yofel> hm...
[10:25] <smartboyhw> yofel, no ideas/
[10:27] <yofel> I forgot what the solution was -.-
[10:27] <smartboyhw> yofel, -.-
[10:28] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, shadeslayer ^ any ideas?
[10:44] <smartboyhw> 4.11.1 uploading...
[10:44] <smartboyhw> I mean, tarballs:P
[10:57] <smartboyhw> SIgh, so many docs to read (from Riddell and shadeslayer )
[10:58] <Riddell> smartboyhw: all useful stuff though no?
[10:58] <smartboyhw> Riddell, of course it's useful stuff
[10:58] <smartboyhw> And speaking about that, yofel WHERE IS YOUR REPLY?!
[10:58] <Riddell> smartboyhw: mind and take notes on things you didn't know or were unsure about else it won't all sink in
[10:58] <yofel> ooops
[10:58] <yofel> Riddell pointed to most thing I wanted to say so I kinda forgot about it -.-
[10:59] <smartboyhw> yofel, -.-
[11:00] <yofel> I'm sorry, but please work yourself through your current TODO list, and do look up what we talked about during the interview if you didn't yet
[11:00] <yofel> I'm somewhere else with my head for at least a week
[11:00] <smartboyhw> yofel, ?
[11:00] <smartboyhw> (Can't understand the head part)
[11:01] <yofel> s/head/brain/
[11:01] <kubotu> yofel meant: "I'm somewhere else with my brain for at least a week"
[11:01] <yofel> personal stuff
[11:01] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh
[11:02]  * smartboyhw warns everybody that his second interview should be around 25th Sep
[11:02] <smartboyhw> Should be around that time
[11:03] <smartboyhw> Huh, didn't expect that amd64 is still waiting to build for oxygen-gtk3 while even armhf and powerpc has completed their job
[11:14] <Riddell> debfx: I'm confused by http://felix.fobos.de/kubuntu/kubuntu-buildstatus.htm I can't see anything in the code to run the uscan-package script
[11:14] <Riddell> debfx: how are the watch column values filled in?
[11:15] <Riddell> smartboyhw: have you worked out what .symbol files are for?
[11:15] <smartboyhw> Riddell, not yet, trying to go through one-by-one
[11:15] <smartboyhw> Just finished looking at debian-qt-kde.mk
[11:16] <smartboyhw> BTW, are we supposed to update akonadi?
[11:16] <debfx> Riddell: the uscan script is run as a cron job
[11:18] <Riddell> debfx: ah I see uscan-package-db is it
[11:18] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I will be updating akonadi to 1.10.2 (and with no FFe, it's bugfixes)
[11:18] <smartboyhw> - Fix PostgreSQL support (once more) ^^

[11:54] <smartboyhw> Riddell, OK, I will:P
[11:54] <Riddell> smartboyhw: groovy, update the etherpad and run the script, let me know if you need an ec2
[11:54] <smartboyhw> Riddell, no need for ec2 in this business, I ran 4.11.0 without it
[12:07] <smartboyhw> DAMNIT, the first thing needing manual support is the first package (kdelibs4)
[12:08] <smartboyhw> While running the script
[12:14] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: you are running the initial upload script for 4.11.1 right?

[12:24] <shadeslayer> did anyone get started on the 4.11.1 packages?
[12:24] <shadeslayer> if not I can do those
[12:26] <classicchins> @shadeslayer, i have posted u personally
[12:26] <classicchins> please checl

[12:44] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, sure
[12:54] <shadeslayer> does anyone have an idea what http://debuild.me/ is
[12:55] <yofel> some package building manager written by paultag AFAIK
[12:55] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yofel: Ah BTW akonadi 1.10.2 in ppa:smartboyhw/packaging-staging-1
[12:55] <yofel> someone please review whether this regexp foo is sensible: http://paste.kde.org/p696ce9c5
[12:55] <yofel> it's supposed to prevent http://paste.kde.org/pdb40848d
[12:56] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, you remember the KF5 database problem in  http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/07/18/%23kubuntu-devel.html ? Did you remember HOWTO fix?
[12:57] <smartboyhw> *Qt5
[12:57] <yofel> shadeslayer: hm, the page was showing something different though a few days ago
[12:58] <yofel> so maybe he's making progress? ^^
[12:58] <shadeslayer> yofel: yeah I know
[12:58] <shadeslayer> yeah, but WHAT IS IT
[12:58] <shadeslayer> driving me nuts it is
[12:58] <shadeslayer> I heard about it a year ago I think
[12:58]  * smartboyhw asks for shadeslayer to answer his question to calm down;P
[12:58] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: what db issue?
[12:58] <shadeslayer> hurray my passport is back at the application center
[12:59] <shadeslayer> I wonder if the brits gave me a visa
[12:59] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, ouch
[12:59] <smartboyhw> Look at the log can't you?
[12:59] <smartboyhw> The link is there
[12:59] <shadeslayer> too much log
[12:59] <shadeslayer> not enough time
[12:59] <smartboyhw> apachelogger: /home/shadeslayer/sauce/kde/qt5/qtbase/src/plugins/sqldrivers/mysql/../../../sql/drivers/mysql/qsql_mysql.cpp:1119: undefined reference to `QSqlDriver::QSqlDriver(QSqlDriverPrivate&, QObject*)'
[12:59] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, ^ 
[12:59] <smartboyhw> You asked for that before
[12:59] <shadeslayer> ash yes
[12:59] <shadeslayer> *ah yes
[13:00] <shadeslayer> Aurelien helped fix that
[13:00] <shadeslayer> uninstall Qt5 packages
[13:00] <shadeslayer> if you want to build Qt5
[13:00] <shadeslayer> they *will* interfere 
[13:00] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, huh? That happens BEFORE I have Qt5 packages
[13:00] <shadeslayer> alternatively, unset the LD_LIBRARY_PATH as I said before
[13:00] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: nope, you definitely have Qt5 packages
[13:01] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, how to unset then?
[13:01] <debfx> yofel: are you parsing the first changelog line with that regexp?
[13:01] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: what does echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH  return for you?
[13:02] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, nothing
[13:02] <shadeslayer> hmm
[13:03] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: did you follow http://community.kde.org/Frameworks/Building
[13:03] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yes, for the god's sake
[13:03] <smartboyhw> I was trying to compile using that guide
[13:03] <shadeslayer> dunno then, Aurelien purged my Qt5 packages and it just worked after that
[13:04] <shadeslayer> ask in #kde-devel
[13:04] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, OK
[13:04] <shadeslayer> oh
[13:04] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh wait?
[13:04] <smartboyhw> *what?
[13:05] <shadeslayer> just a thought, but I seriously doubt it
[13:05] <shadeslayer> maybe the Qt4 packages are interfering
[13:05] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, dunno
[13:06] <smartboyhw> Let me try
[13:08] <shadeslayer> I *really* doubt it
[13:08] <yofel> debfx: first pattern extracts the full first changelog entry, second patter matches the new message against that
[13:10] <smartboyhw> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS: http://paste.kde.org/pe7a6f193/
[13:10] <smartboyhw> (That's when running the script)
[13:12] <yofel> meh, I can't call .group(0) if the version doesn't match as the match object will be Null
[13:12] <smartboyhw> Meh, I can't understand what happened to that paste
[13:12] <shadeslayer> looks like the SSL handshake failed?
[13:12] <shadeslayer> silly launchpad
[13:13] <smartboyhw> Uh god, that means re-running the script again
[13:13] <yofel> smartboyhw: wait
[13:13] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh?
[13:13] <yofel> let me finish my regex work, then you can test that right away :P
[13:13] <shadeslayer> ^^
[13:13] <smartboyhw> yofel, what!?
[13:13]  * smartboyhw is starting to not understand
[13:13]  * shadeslayer also suggests addinga  try / catch statement there
[13:14] <yofel> see what I pasted a while ago when you where asking to review akonadi
[13:14] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh
[13:14] <smartboyhw> MEH
[13:14] <yofel> the script currently doesn't handle re-runs well ^^
[13:15] <shadeslayer> well, just use --nopush and purge the entire folder :P
[13:15] <shadeslayer> as simple as that :P
[13:15] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, :(
[13:15] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: are you running the script locally?
[13:15] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yes
[13:16] <shadeslayer> uffff
[13:16] <shadeslayer> use the EC2 powa
[13:16] <shadeslayer> it's quicker that way
[13:16] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, I successfully ran it for 4.11.0
[13:16] <yofel> doesn't matter. I get SSL errors from Launchpad too every now and then
[13:18] <debfx> yofel: not sure if it's easier but there's also dpkg-parsechangelog
[13:18] <smartboyhw> yofel, since you are fixing that script, you run it:P
[13:19] <yofel> smartboyhw: good idea actually
[13:19] <smartboyhw> \o/
[13:19]  * smartboyhw can focus on building qt5
[13:20] <yofel> debfx: hm, thanks for the reminder, that might actually help
[13:26] <debfx> yofel: and there is python-debian
[13:26] <debfx> which should also be able to parse changelogs
[13:29] <Quintasan> WHY APT-TRANSPORT-HTTPS DOENS'T PULL CA-CERTIFICATES
[13:29] <Quintasan> hurr

[13:38] <smartboyhw> Even I'm 23rd place
[13:39] <yofel> those stats are fun
[13:39] <yofel> shadeslayer has more lines, but I said more in fewer lines ^^
[13:39] <smartboyhw> yofel, sure, you're at the top;)
[13:40] <smartboyhw> Hmm, I speak the fewest words
[13:40] <shadeslayer> muwhahaha
[13:40] <shadeslayer> I was more active in terms of hours
[13:41] <shadeslayer> BluesKaj and lordievader are just crazy people

[13:41] <yofel> no, they have a rather limited activity time, they just do a LOT
[13:41] <smartboyhw> Which, I can't:P
[13:42] <shadeslayer> ahh, this is for #kubuntu
[13:42] <shadeslayer> makes sense
[13:42] <smartboyhw> For another LOL stat, that's http://people.ubuntu.com/~unit193/pisg/ubuntustudio.html :P
[13:42] <shadeslayer> I thought it was for #kubuntu-devel

[13:42] <smartboyhw> If it is for -devel, things will change a LOT
[13:42] <shadeslayer> yeah
[13:42] <shadeslayer> completely missed the header there
[13:42]  * smartboyhw would have ranked top 20:P
[13:42] <shadeslayer> scrolled right to the stats
[13:42] <shadeslayer> kind of weird that I still rank in #kubuntu
[13:43] <Quintasan> I'm just going to slap shadeslayer with a trout there to get to the stas

[13:44]  * shadeslayer will slap Quintasan with bean stalks
[13:44] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, my script ran failed due to launchpad ssl shake;P
[13:44] <BluesKaj> shadeslayer, i sleep , but i no longer have to got to work , since I'm retired , hence I have time to spend online :)
[13:44] <Quintasan> I was about to throw some bricks at him but if he is fixing
[13:44] <yofel> the regex works now, but it breaks debcommit expectations so I'm now fixing that
[13:44] <Quintasan> kubotu: order beer for yofel

[13:44] <Quintasan> But I think the script doesn't track that
[13:44] <Quintasan> :P
[13:45] <smartboyhw> OH NO, UBOTTU DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT PEACE
[13:45]  * Quintasan throws bricks at ubottu
[13:45]  * shadeslayer will build a brick buster
[13:45] <Quintasan> Now he should have aquired the knowledge
[13:46] <smartboyhw> !peace
[13:46] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, nah, I don't think so
[13:47] <Quintasan> oh well
[13:47] <Quintasan> at least we tried!
[13:58] <yofel> drat, pisg has no quassel parser :S
[13:59] <smartboyhw> yofel, :S
[14:02] <smartboyhw> Ah, BTW, Plasma Active 4 is soon to be released (the announcement will go out probably on Monday)
[14:09] <smartboyhw> The Qt5 build officially enters the danger-zone: QtWebKit
[14:09] <smartboyhw> \o/
[14:10] <yofel> ok, tell us in 3h whether it built
[14:10] <smartboyhw> yofel, yeah:P
[14:21] <smartboyhw> You know the first thing they mentioned on Ubuntu UK podcast's Ubuntu news section? They talked about what happened to me not being able to join Hangouts on air:P
[14:23] <yofel> rofl
[14:24] <yofel> made a quick quassel parser
[14:24] <yofel> let me upload that
[14:24] <smartboyhw> yofel, congratulations!
[14:25] <smartboyhw> yofel, what 'appened to the script, BTW?
[14:25] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: heh
[14:25] <yofel> running
[14:25] <yofel> now at kruler
[14:25]  * shadeslayer rages at airlines
[14:25] <smartboyhw> yofel, great:)
[14:25]  * smartboyhw rages at shadeslayer 
[14:25] <shadeslayer> all tickets are now at double the cost
[14:25] <shadeslayer> of what they were last week
[14:26] <yofel> hm, pisg parser bug, next try
[14:26] <smartboyhw> heh heh
[14:26] <yofel> but the big number section is fun
[14:27] <yofel> enjoy :D http://people.ubuntu.com/~yofel/pisg/kubuntu-devel.html
[14:28] <yofel> that's from my backlog which goes back to april 2010
[14:28] <smartboyhw> see? I told you I will be in top 20
[14:28] <smartboyhw> :P
[14:30] <shadeslayer> "apachelogger is a very aggressive person. He/She attacked others 15 times."
[14:30] <shadeslayer> haha
[14:31] <shadeslayer> "Another lonely one was shadeslayer, who managed to hit 506 times." :(
[14:32] <shadeslayer> yofel: "A topic was never set on this channel."
[14:32] <shadeslayer> looks wrong
[14:32] <shadeslayer> :P
[14:32] <yofel> topic and op parsing is wrong it seems
[14:32] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[14:54] <yofel> script seems to have worked now. uploading
[14:56] <smartboyhw> yofel, \o/
[14:56] <Riddell> yofel: nice :)
[15:02]  * Riddell announces http://qa.kubuntu.co.uk/kubuntu-buildstatus/kubuntu-buildstatus.html
[15:03] <shadeslayer> neat
=== smartboyhw_ is now known as smartboyhw
[15:04] <smartboyhw> \o/
[15:04] <smartboyhw> Riddell, can you upload akonadi from my packaging-staging-1 PPA?
[15:04] <smartboyhw> Riddell, BTW when you upload, please add "Bugfix" to the dch
[15:04] <smartboyhw> I think I forgotten to write that
[15:06] <yofel> pad updated, someone please fix kdelibs and kde-workspace patches, I don't have time for that right now
[15:06]  * smartboyhw can't
[15:06] <smartboyhw> Still building qt5-.-
[15:10] <smartboyhw> Riddell, huh, what do you want me to fix?
[15:10] <smartboyhw> Re: The email you just sent
[15:11] <Riddell> smartboyhw: anything yellow or red?
[15:11] <Riddell> I wonder if we should update virtuoso-opensource
[15:11] <Riddell> vHanda: do we want virtuoso-opensource 7?
[15:11] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ah, you mean these
[15:12] <Riddell> also adding watch files for those which miss them
[15:12] <smartboyhw> Riddell, will touch those that doesn't need an FFe tmr, but have you uploaded akonadi for me?
[15:13] <Riddell> smartboyhw: looking at it now
[15:13] <smartboyhw> Riddell, great
[15:13] <smartboyhw> It's just a fix, so,  no need for a FFe.
[15:13] <shadeslayer> Riddell: wasn't that a no no on the KDE Packagers ML?
[15:13] <Riddell> mm could well have been
[15:14] <smartboyhw> Heh, caused a topic disaster on #ubuntu-devel
[15:14] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, that's 6.1.8
[15:14] <smartboyhw> Oops, 6.1.7
[15:15] <shadeslayer> ScottK: Riddell KTP is still in the unapproved queue
[15:15] <shadeslayer> :<
[15:15] <shadeslayer> :<
[15:17] <Riddell> SRU is got ScottK or another ~sru to do
[15:17] <Riddell> s/got/for
[15:17] <smartboyhw> Riddell, why don't you apply for ~ubuntu-sru?
[15:18] <shadeslayer> yes ^
[15:18] <Riddell> mm I'm not sure I trust myself to have the eye for detail it needs, brain injury and eye for detail don't necessarily go
[15:19] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ;O
[15:20] <smartboyhw> Due to qt5 building, now Chromium goes "He's dead, Jim!" with only 3 tabs..
[15:20] <smartboyhw> Stupid qt5

[15:34] <shadeslayer> ScottK: is something wrong with the ktp upload?
[15:34] <ScottK> shadeslayer: No, just haven't had time to really look at it.
[15:34] <shadeslayer> :(
[15:34] <ScottK> Since it's not on the MRE list, it needs a full review.
[15:35] <shadeslayer> right
[15:43]  * Riddell publises http://blogs.kde.org/2013/08/30/new-kubuntu-dev-tools
[15:46]  * Riddell unblocks some kubuntu bits for beta
[16:02] <smartboyhw> yofel, \o/ qt5 completed build!
[16:04] <yofel> congratulations ;P
[16:05] <smartboyhw> yofel, ;P
[16:05] <shadeslayer> ScottK: I just hope it can be reviewed sooner rather than later
[16:11] <smartboyhw> Riddell, why did you mention Kubuntu Ninjas in your blog post? It's supposed to be secret
[16:12] <BluesKaj> says who ?
[16:12] <Riddell> >:)
[16:32] <vHanda> Riddell: please don't. virtuoso 6.1.7 already has a number of regressions
[16:32] <vHanda> I'm fairly certain 7 will have some as well
[16:32] <vHanda> let me test it out some more
[16:46] <rdieter> vHanda: been meaning to ask, are these bugs/problems documented anywhere, like a bug tracker?
[16:47] <vHanda> nope. It's mostly just - run all the unit tests - if they all pass, you're good to know
[16:47] <vHanda> *good to go
[16:47] <vHanda> if you can do that for virtuoso 7, it would be nice. I keep getting compile failures.
[16:48] <vHanda> though I heave of some notable regressions regarding full text indexing in virtuoso 7 (virtuoso-users ml - need to confirm what it was)
[16:48] <rdieter> ok
[16:51] <rdieter> vHanda: which unit tests, fwiw?  soprano? nepomuk-core? other?
[16:51] <vHanda> nepomuk-core and the soprano virtuosobackendtest
[16:52] <rdieter> ok, thanks
[16:52] <vHanda> *I have heard of some
[16:56] <yofel> anyone else seeing http://paste.kde.org/p052a5509 from printer-applet?
[17:00] <shadeslayer> yofel: did you upload kdelibs?
[17:00] <yofel> shadeslayer: as I said, no
[17:00] <shadeslayer> oh, I didn't see that
[17:00] <yofel> see pad
[17:01] <genii> yofel: I could try on 13.10 here if I install it.
[17:02] <yofel> I get that on every attempt to start it, not sure if it's pykde or whatever else
[17:04]  * shadeslayer takes up kdelibs
[17:05] <genii> yofel: I'm getting this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6044888/    ...and it says can't find the proper debug symbols
[17:06] <ScottK> yofel: I don't think that's pykde.
[17:13] <genii> The debug symbols it wants to install in my case are for /usr/lib/libkdeui.so.5
[17:16] <shadeslayer> nooooo
[17:16] <shadeslayer> yofel: kfreebsd patch fails
[17:16] <shadeslayer> can I just drop that  -.-
[17:16] <shadeslayer> we don't support kfreebsd
[17:16] <shadeslayer> seems pointless for me to spend time on the patch
[17:21] <yofel> well, you have a point there
[17:22] <shadeslayer> yep all others apply fine
[17:22] <shadeslayer> I'm disabling it
[17:27] <shadeslayer> grrrr
[17:27] <shadeslayer> quilt applies patches
[17:27] <shadeslayer> debuild doesn't
[17:27] <shadeslayer> needs refreshing
[17:30] <genii> yofel: With python-dbg installed, I get: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6044961/
[17:32] <yofel> yeah, same thing as here
[18:30] <genii> Meh. Segfault every time... System Settings... Hardware... Input devices.... Touchpad  (upon selecting it)
[18:51] <yofel> indeed
[18:51] <yofel> software-properties-kde crashes as well
[18:52] <yofel> I think we have quit a bit of a python issue
[18:53] <shadeslayer> huh
[18:55] <genii> As I also just wrote in #ubuntu+1 ... additional error installing debug symbols for that. eg: /var/cache/apt/archives/kdelibs5-dbg_4%3a4.11.0-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/libkdeui.so.5.11.0', which is also in package libkdeui5-dbgsym 4:4.11.0-0ubuntu1  ...So I manually did a --force-overwrite with it just now
[19:01] <genii> yofel: Should I file a bug? I have the debug info now
[19:12] <shadeslayer> yofel: I am totally unsure what happend to kdelibs build
[19:12] <shadeslayer> it seems that it's stuck
[19:13] <genii> Ah, it's already reported in KDE as bug 324002
[19:13] <ubottu> Error: Launchpad bug 324002 could not be found
[19:14] <shadeslayer> kde bug 324002
[19:14] <ubottu> KDE bug 324002 in style "System settings panel crashes upon attempts to access input devices" [Crash,Unconfirmed] http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=324002
[19:20] <yofel> shadeslayer: could be...
[19:20] <yofel> really weird
[19:23] <genii> yofel: My debug info was different, appended the bug
[19:33] <yofel> oh, kdelibs amd64 finished
[19:43] <shadeslayer> cool
[19:44] <shadeslayer> yofel: i386 is done as well
[19:44] <shadeslayer> it's just uploading
[19:47] <Noskcaj> Would you like me to merge kombu as a FFe? The changelog is at http://paste.ubuntu.com/6045406/
[19:51] <Noskcaj> nice build checking script btw
[20:09] <Noskcaj> Never mind, the line "Now depends on :mod:`amqp` 1.0.13" means it won't build on my PC
[20:23] <Noskcaj> Going through the list of packages, a sip update might be good. the only change is "Fixed a regression in the handling of hidden virtuals."
[20:42] <shadeslayer> I don't think a SIP update is a good idea
[20:43] <shadeslayer> *because* it's SIP
[20:49] <yofel> shadeslayer: it's fine as long as the API doesn't change
[20:50] <ScottK> You don't want the sip in saucy ATM.
[20:56] <yofel> ScottK: so that's what's crashing python all over the place?
[20:56] <ScottK> Yes.
[20:56] <ScottK> If someone wanted to do a ~really-lastversion for sip4, pyqt4, and pyqt5, we probably should.
[20:57] <yofel> genii: FYI ^
[21:05] <Noskcaj> I only understand half of what you guys said, but sip is only a tiny update and cutting the regression out of saucy can't be a bad thing
[21:14] <ScottK> It needs downgrading, not upgrading.
[21:14] <ScottK> The bug isn't fixed in the newer version and will, eventually, need coordinated changes in pykde and sip4 to solve.
