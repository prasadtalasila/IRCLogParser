[00:36] <tonk> Do you know if  there is any way to change the name of the "Pages" in the Plasma netbook environment? (I find no "activity" option in the menu while configuring the desktop, as in the non-netbook edition)
[00:57] <tonk> is this always so silent? This is the first time I connect.. is this a user's-support channel, or just intended for developers?

[09:26] <kilo_byte> hey.. i have more than 1 desktop enrvironment. how can i uninstall everything other than Kde
[09:28] <tsimpson> !purekde
[09:28] <ubottu> If you want to remove all !Gnome packages and have a default !Kubuntu system follow the instructions here « http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde »
[09:28] <tsimpson> kilo_byte: try that link
[09:28] <kilo_byte> okie
[09:28] <kilo_byte> its not just gnome 
[09:28] <kilo_byte> xfce, lde , unity.
[09:28] <kilo_byte> pretty much of everything :P
[09:28] <tsimpson> it has instructions for most *-desktop packages
[09:29] <tsimpson> ubuntu, xubuntu, lubuntu, and edubuntu
[09:29] <kilo_byte> tsimpson, my system has gone pretty slow too
[09:29] <tsimpson> the others shouldn't be hard to remove
[09:29] <kilo_byte> is there something I can do about that 
[09:29] <tsimpson> probably the best thing to try is replacing the HDD
[09:30] <kilo_byte> hdd aint that old :D
[09:30] <tsimpson> and upgrade RAM if you can, that's always a good way to get a boost
[09:30] <kilo_byte> besides its not economical :P
[09:30] <tsimpson> HDD's tend to get very inefficient over time
[09:30] <kilo_byte> i have 3 gb ram and 500 hdd more than enough for kubuntu i suppose
[09:31] <tsimpson> you could possibly do a fresh install, not so bad if you have a separate partition for /home
[09:31] <kilo_byte> yep . they do
[09:31] <kilo_byte> but its just 2 years ;)
[09:32] <kilo_byte> i dont have a seprate one :P
[09:32] <kilo_byte> i think i will back up that one
[09:32] <tsimpson> !home
[09:32] <ubottu> Your home directory is where all of your personal files are usually kept. For moving your home directory to a separate partition, please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving
[09:33] <tsimpson> it's very useful, especially if you ever want to reinstall or completely replace your OS
[09:33] <kilo_byte> !bin
[09:33] <kilo_byte> i have got windows too :P
[09:33] <kilo_byte> which is really a pain
[09:34] <kilo_byte> !kubuntu-desktop
[09:34] <ubottu> k/ed/x/l/ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage. It depends upon other packages and brings them in; you can safely remove it, but it is recommended that you re-install it when upgrading.
[09:35] <tsimpson> sooner or later you get tired of dual-booting, or you realise that you've been avoiding it for so long it's not really worth you keeping windows around
[09:36] <tsimpson> besides, you can get windows in a VM pretty easily
[09:36] <kilo_byte> tsimpson, there is only one use of windows for me
[09:36] <kilo_byte> google input tools
[09:36] <kilo_byte> and writing :D
[09:37] <tsimpson> the only time I've ever needed windows is when some device needed special drivers to interact with, and those drivers only existed for windows
[09:37] <tsimpson> and for those I just used a VM 
[09:38] <kilo_byte> windows 8 has a pretty good UI
[09:38] <smartboyhw> kilo_byte, I hate Metro UI
[09:38] <kilo_byte> and it boots pretty fast too
[09:39] <kilo_byte> metro UI
[09:39] <kilo_byte> havent hear smartboyhw 
[09:39] <kilo_byte> heard*
[09:39] <smartboyhw> kilo_byte, Metro UI = Windows 8 UI
[09:40] <kilo_byte> smartboyhw,  oh.. cool
[09:40] <smartboyhw> kilo_byte, not cool

[11:52] <marcellux> hi. I've got a problem. when I connect my laptop to my tv via HDMI nothing happens. any ideas?
[11:53] <eur33r> KDE is so slow
[11:53] <eur33r> it doesn't run on 2.2GHz dual core celeron
[11:54] <ikonia> eur33r: why do you think it's the cpu that's the bottleneck /?
[11:55] <eur33r> CPU usage, 30% idle
[11:55] <eur33r> anyway
[11:55] <eur33r> I also have 4GB RAM
[11:55] <ikonia> that doesn't mean it's causing a slow down
[11:56] <eur33r> ATI Radeon 6450 HD
[11:56] <ikonia> as if it was slowing down you'd expect more usage as it would be bottlenecking
[11:56] <eur33r> and yeah that#s all the information I am allowed to give you
[11:56] <ikonia> allowed to give me ?
[11:56] <eur33r> not my computer
[11:56] <eur33r> you might hack it
[11:57] <ikonia> then no point discussing it any more - please don't raise this topic again unless you are willing to provide information 
[11:58] <hateball> marcellux: well what do you expect to happen? are you telling the OS to actually output any image over hdmi?
[11:58] <eur33r> ikonia: okay, what info do you need?
[11:58] <eur33r> just ask
[11:58] <Leoneof> your password?
[11:58] <ikonia> eur33r: version of kubuntu, the configuration you've done on your video card, what's slow, what's not slow, 
[12:00] <Leoneof> eur33r: the animation to min/max window is slow ,right?
[12:00] <marcellux> <hateball> no. I did not. I thought I just plug the cable and I can see my desktop on the tv
[12:01] <eur33r> Leoneof: yes
[12:01] <marcellux> like I do with windows
[12:02] <eur33r> ikonia: too personal tbh
[12:02] <ikonia> eur33r: then please don't ask for help with the problem
[12:03] <eur33r> ikonia: stop trolling
[12:08] <hateball> marcellux: It depends on what graphics chipset you have. If you have for instance Intel, you can use KDE's native plasmoid to change output
[12:08] <hateball> marcellux: Also it helps to know which version of Kubuntu you're running, as later versions use kscreen
[12:09] <classicchins> Any one there? 
[12:09] <classicchins> hello
[12:09] <classicchins> i need some help from Mac users who use Kubuntu on mac
[12:10] <marcellux> I am using 12.10 with Kernel 3.10.0. It seems the OS does not even know how to deal with the HDMI port
[12:11] <classicchins> hey
[12:11] <classicchins> i am having some trouble
[12:12] <hateball> !anyone
[12:12] <ubottu> A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[12:12] <classicchins> @marcellux , i have installed Kubuntu 12.04 LTS on macbook, but once i restart after installation, i can't get to chose Kubuntu :(
[12:12] <hateball> marcellux: And what graphics chipset do you use?
[12:13] <classicchins> any there who can help me with this ?
[12:13] <hateball> marcellux: And do you use any proprietary drivers?
[12:14] <marcellux> <hateball> How can I find out what graphic chipset I am using? and if I'm using propietary drivers?
[12:15] <marcellux> <classicchins> I am sorry, I cannot help you with that. I never installed LInux on Mac
[12:18] <hateball> marcellux: In a terminal, "lspci|grep VGA" should give you some hint
[12:18] <hateball> marcellux: jockey-kde can be used to install proprietary drivers for nVidia or Ati
[12:19] <marcellux> <hateball> this is the result: 
[12:19] <marcellux> 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)
[12:19] <marcellux> 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Madison [Radeon HD 5000M Series]
[12:22] <hateball> marcellux: I know next to nothing about ATI, but I think you should install the proprietary drivers using jockey-kde and that might make things work automagically
[12:23] <marcellux> <hateball> thanks. I will try that with the additional drivers for the 3rd party drives!
[12:23] <hateball> :)
[12:27] <classicchins> shadeslayer: i need help with dual boot .. i have installed Kubuntu on mac , but once installation is finished, and i reboot the machine, i am not able to chose between OSX and Installed Kubuntu
[12:27] <shadeslayer> right
[12:27] <shadeslayer> hi
[12:27] <shadeslayer> classicchins: what machine do you have?
[12:27] <classicchins> macbook pro 9,2
[12:27] <shadeslayer> okay cool
[12:27] <shadeslayer> so there are two ways to fix this
[12:27] <classicchins> okay,
[12:27] <shadeslayer> you can a) hold option at boot to choose between OS X and Kubuntu
[12:27] <shadeslayer> or b) You can install refind which is what I did
[12:28] <shadeslayer> see http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/
[12:28] <classicchins> shadeslayer: well, i had chosen the first way,
[12:28] <shadeslayer> refind gives you the advantage of kernel stub booting
[12:28] <shadeslayer> so you bypass grub and you can directly boot the kernel from the EFI bootloader
[12:28] <classicchins> but, once i install, and reboot .. and hold the option key during startup, again, i can't find the option to chose
[12:29] <classicchins> hmmm.. so that leaves me only that option left ?
[12:29] <jussi> refind is nice
[12:29] <jussi> I recommend it
[12:30] <classicchins> thanks jussi and shadeslayer , lemme try using that now :(
[12:30] <shadeslayer> classicchins: yeah, use refind if holding the option key doesn't work
[12:31] <classicchins> had same issues with Ubuntu earlier @shadeslayer .. but it worked for few weeks, and then again stopped working .. now i am moving to Kubuntu and from the beginning its not working
[12:32] <classicchins> lemme see what i can do with refind now .. 
[12:33] <shadeslayer> carlosbuz: I suspect some sort of grub-efi issue
[12:33] <shadeslayer> but I haven't used grub in a long time since I started using efi stub booting
[12:36] <marcellux> <hateball> unfortunatelly, it did not work. I got an error message telling me to take a look at the jockey.log. could this be caused because of using a higher kernel than what it sues this kubuntu version?
[12:38] <hateball> marcellux: oh you're using a custom kernel?
[12:38] <hateball> backported or such
[12:38] <hateball> and yes I guess that could be an issue. to be honest I havent used restricted drivers in years, I tend to stick to Intel for hasslefree computing ;p
[12:40] <marcellux> <hateball> the kernel I got it from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
=== moji_ is now known as moji
[12:41] <marcellux> <hateball> got version v3.10-saucy
[12:41] <hateball> marcellux: Yes, sadly I do not know how well that works together with something like jockey
[12:41] <hateball> But someone else in here might, so stick around I guess
[12:43] <marcellux> I will try to go back to the roots, with the original kernel I should be using according to my kubuntu version
[12:48] <BluesKaj> marcellux, good plan , then you'll have the correct kernel modules available for your hardware
[12:50] <marcellux> thanks. I will go now offline for a bit. I hope it works. cheers

[13:27] <classicchins_> @shadeslayer
[13:27] <shadeslayer> classicchins_: oh sorry
[13:27] <shadeslayer> you just download the deb and install it
[13:27] <shadeslayer> that's all you have to do
[13:27] <shadeslayer> and then reboot
[13:27] <classicchins_> shadeslayer: setting up kubuntu now ..
[13:27] <shadeslayer> ah okay
[13:28] <classicchins_> just the same way i did earlier, but this time i have installed rEFInd
[13:28] <shadeslayer> cool :)
[13:28] <classicchins_> hope this time it works fine !
[13:28] <classicchins_> i dont have a pretty good connection and its taking long time to install the packages .. 4th time installing today :(
[13:29] <mauricio> mauro_: Hi
[13:29] <shadeslayer> classicchins_: which version are you installing?
[13:29] <classicchins_> 12.04
[13:29] <classicchins_> LTS
[13:30] <shadeslayer> uhmmm .. I'd recommend 13.04
[13:30] <shadeslayer> atleast
[13:30] <classicchins_> shadeslayer :  oh :( i dont want to follow same procedure again :( damn .. butw, can i directly upgrade some way or the other to 13.04 ?
[13:30] <shadeslayer> because the kernel is more recent, probably has better support and I know that the 64 bit kubuntu ISO can be booted off a USB stick
[13:31] <shadeslayer> you can sure, but the biggest issue is booting into Kubuntu once you install
[13:31] <classicchins_> hmmm :( what do u suggest me to do now ?
[13:31] <shadeslayer> wasn't that your biggest issue?
[13:31] <shadeslayer> that you can't reboot into kubuntu once you install it
[13:31] <mauricio> mauro:ping
[13:31] <mauricio> mauro_: ping
[13:31] <classicchins_> shadeslayer : yes, that was
[13:32] <shadeslayer> classicchins_: yeah, so 13.04 doesn't have that issue AFAIK
[13:32] <classicchins_> shadeslayer: lemme try rebooting now .. i ll ping u here once i am done for now.. lets continue upgrading discussion later .. 
[13:32] <shadeslayer> okay
[13:32] <shadeslayer> here's the thing
[13:32] <classicchins_> :)
[13:32] <classicchins_> k
[13:32] <shadeslayer> if you can reboot into kubuntu, awesome
[13:32] <shadeslayer> then you don't need to upgrade
[13:33] <shadeslayer> but if you can't, then you'll need to download 13.04 and install that
[13:33] <classicchins_> shadeslayer: Even i hope it will reboot .. if it fails, again i ll have to download and install 13.04 and see if it works fine !
[13:33] <shadeslayer> cool :)
[13:33] <classicchins_> shadeslayer : rebooting.. cya later once i do login after reboot :)
[13:34] <shadeslayer> :)
[13:37] <classicchins> @shadeslayer : m on mob now.. Its a failure again :(
[13:37] <shadeslayer> classicchins: thought so
[13:38] <shadeslayer> classicchins: please download the 64 bit 13.04 ISO
[13:38] <shadeslayer> note that only the 64 bit one works
[13:38] <shadeslayer> the 32 bit one doesn't have grub-efi
[13:39] <classicchins> Shadeslayer: from mobile now.. It's a failure again :(
[13:39] <shadeslayer> oh
[13:40] <shadeslayer> <shadeslayer> classicchins: please download the 64 bit 13.04 ISO
[13:40] <shadeslayer> <shadeslayer> note that only the 64 bit one works
[13:40] <shadeslayer> <shadeslayer> the 32 bit one doesn't have grub-efi
[13:40] <shadeslayer> classicchins: ^^
[13:40] <classicchins> In boot menu ... I had 2 options.. One for mac and other to load linux.. When i chose linux it failed andbasked to insert boot device
[13:40] <classicchins> :(
[13:41] <classicchins> I am trying 64 bit onw
[13:41] <classicchins> Now again i ll have to wait for 1 day to get 13.04 downloaded :(
[13:43] <shadeslayer> classicchins: yeah, macs are horribkle
[13:43] <shadeslayer> I've vowed never to get one again
[13:44] <classicchins> Shadeslayer: lol.. Any ways.. Thanks for ya time.. Cya tomo :)
[13:45] <classicchins> Shadeslayer: but i love mac n macos ;)
[13:45] <shadeslayer> classicchins: heh, sure, but they charge you apple tax for no reason
[13:46] <shadeslayer> I got swayed by the guy selling the laptop at the apple store
[13:46] <classicchins> Shadeslayer : i know :( i wish they lay it off soon :(
[13:47] <shadeslayer> lol, probably never going to happen
[13:47] <classicchins> Lol
[13:47] <shadeslayer> why do you think they have billions in the bank

[13:49] <classicchins> Shadeslayer: any ways :( cya around tomo once i try with 13.04 
[13:49] <classicchins> Hope that will work :(
[13:49] <shadeslayer> it will
[13:50] <classicchins> Hope it ll
[13:50] <classicchins> Or else m going to hang myself.. Lol
[13:50] <classicchins> Cya.. Thanks a lot again :)
[13:51] <ikonia> shadeslayer: do you run kubuntu on your macbook ?
[13:52] <shadeslayer> ikonia: yes
[13:52] <ikonia> which year macbook is it ?
[13:52] <shadeslayer> 8,2
[13:53] <ikonia> how do you find it ?
[13:53] <shadeslayer> depends, I had *alot* of issues when I bought it
[13:53] <shadeslayer> which was in late mid 2011
[13:53] <shadeslayer> s/late//
[13:53] <ikonia> a lot of issues with it as a device, or a lot of issues running kubuntu on it 
[13:54] <shadeslayer> the latter
[13:54] <shadeslayer> primarily because the kernel didn't have proper hardware support
[13:54] <ikonia> yes, hence my questioning, 
[13:54] <shadeslayer> it's alot better now
[13:54] <ikonia> due you dual boot it with mac OS, or pure kubuntu ?
[13:55] <shadeslayer> ikonia: I've done both in the past, but I have OS X now because sometimes I have to call up apple support for part replacements and they only support OS X fore debugging
[13:55] <shadeslayer> so far I've had my battery and HDD replaced ( over the course of 2 years )
[13:55] <ikonia> shadeslayer: how do you manage the booting ?
[13:55] <ikonia> that's shockingly bad luck for hardware failure
[13:55] <shadeslayer> ikonia: I use refind which allows me to directly boot the kernel
[13:55] <ss_haze> I need to make a short cut to command on kde desktop like sudo dolphin /var/www
[13:55] <shadeslayer> ss_haze: you could put a desktop file with : kdesudo dolphin
[13:56] <ikonia> shadeslayer: so you basically put a layer into the efi setup, 
[13:56] <ss_haze> ah
[13:56] <shadeslayer> not sure if dolphin takes arguments
[13:56] <shadeslayer> okay it does
[13:56] <ss_haze> so I create .desktop file
[13:56] <ss_haze> I forgot this
[13:56] <shadeslayer> ikonia: kinda, EFI allows you to run additional scripts once it sets up everything
[13:56] <shadeslayer> refind is just a EFI script
[13:57] <shadeslayer> which allows you to choose between OS's/Kernels and even allows you to boot grub EFI
[13:57] <shadeslayer> kernel stub booting is necessary on the 8,2 because with grub efi something goes wrong with the radeon card
[13:57] <shadeslayer> but works perfectly with kernel stub booting
[13:59] <shadeslayer> ikonia: though the hardware itself is bad in certain ways
[13:59] <shadeslayer> ikonia: for eg the aluminium shell gets dented easily
[13:59] <shadeslayer> I dropped it a couple of times and one of the edges is pressed in
[14:00] <shadeslayer> then it has heating issues because the body is all aluminium
[14:00] <ikonia> shadeslayer: I concur, it's a mixed bag of good/bad
[14:00] <shadeslayer> yep
[14:00] <shadeslayer> but I won't ever buy another MBP again
[14:00] <shadeslayer> too much apple tax
[14:01] <ikonia> I was curious to how you'd found it with kubuntu and especially the boot management
[14:01] <shadeslayer> Get a Dell / Thinkpad + 3 year warranty
[14:01] <BluesKaj> it's a shame how some manufacturers won't supply drivers for linux users , altho most HW is supported there some anomalies that are constantly ignored. Lexmark (most) and Creative SB CAO132 are a couple of examples
[14:01] <ikonia> I'm sat here now on my second thinkpad with perfect support and stability
[14:01] <shadeslayer> ikonia: well ... I can definitely say that the average person who buys a MBP won't be able to run Kubuntu on it
[14:01] <shadeslayer> you'll need to mess with too many things
[14:01] <ikonia> BluesKaj: apple is an exception to the rule, they do make it %101 clear when you buy and in support that their hardware/software platform is a black box 
[14:02] <shadeslayer> ^^
[14:02] <BluesKaj> ikonia, and with most things apple , you pay for support , correct ?
[14:02] <shadeslayer> btw with Windows 8.1 coming up TPM chips will become mandatory
[14:03] <ikonia> BluesKaj: partly, there is a good warranty
[14:03] <shadeslayer> so not sure how much I can trust computers with 8.1
[14:03] <shadeslayer> BluesKaj: I have an extended warranty
[14:03] <shadeslayer> cost me 300 USD I think
[14:04] <shadeslayer> gives you a extended 2 year cover period which does not involve the battery
[14:04] <shadeslayer> but I managed to talk them into replacing mine for free
[14:04] <BluesKaj> never owned any apple prods , altho my daughter has an IMac which has a dead HDD ,and replacement is really complicated and expensive. 
[14:05] <shadeslayer> yep, if you go through the official channels it's super expensive :<
[14:05] <BluesKaj> so she bought a lenovo thru her friend'scompany , saving about 40%
[14:06] <shadeslayer> whoa
[14:06]  * shadeslayer needs to find people at lenovo :P
[14:06] <shadeslayer> then I can buy a thinkpad for super cheap prices xD
[14:06] <shadeslayer> I'm waiting for a thinkpad with a Intel 4400 chip + a FHD display
[14:07] <shadeslayer> and that's less than 1.5 KG's :P

It won't even respond to crtl-alt-del at that stage, and I have to pull the plug :(

[16:55] <ikonia> or get anyone that it hangs on 
[16:55] <jcgs> kk
[16:55] <jcgs> it doesn't seem to get stuck doing anything though... it seems to do everything it says it's doing sucessfully 
[17:06] <jcgs> ikonia: it failed again :( the last two things were * stopping [OK] * starting CUPS printer spooler/server [OK]
[17:06] <jcgs> ikonia: i think it's stopped on the cups one a lot
=== FReaper is now known as FlameReaper
[17:10] <ikonia> it shouldn't be stopping anything
[17:10] <ikonia> it should be starting
[17:17] <jcgs> ikonia: it stops lots of things
[17:18] <jcgs> like "restore sound cards mixer states
[17:18] <jcgs> ikonia: going to have dinner now, but will leave IRC open.

[18:25] <arkanabar> Is there a KDE plasmoid that will hold the mouse pointer locked in place?
[18:25] <arkanabar> There used to be a panel widget for that in gnome 2, and I would LOVE to have that for my laptop.
[18:27] <BluesKaj> arkanabar, does synaptiks have such a feature ?
[18:30] <arkanabar> BluesKaj: not sure, not on my lappy right now.
[18:33] <BluesKaj> I don't recall such a feature , but I haven't had access to my laptop in over a yr :P
[18:33] <arkanabar> I'm using 12.04 on it.
[18:35] <genii> BluesKaj: Are you running 13.10 right now?

[19:57] <PewPewPew> For people that use non-stock kernels. pf vs liquorix? I have been luqirox *zen really) for years. But would like to hear others experiences
[19:58] <PewPewPew> liquorix (zen really)
[19:59] <BluesKaj> PewPewPew, I dropped it after about a month , didn't see much benefit and it mucked up my graphics driver after an upgrade on 13.04 last week 
[19:59] <BluesKaj> liquorix that is
[19:59] <PewPewPew> Well this is basic intel (not i7) so its pretty simple going
[20:00] <PewPewPew> And even with liquorix its not that /hard/ to get it going even after an update
[20:00] <PewPewPew> nvidia that is
[20:00] <BluesKaj> ok , my graphics is nvidia 8400gs pci 
[20:00] <PewPewPew> you just need to use the manual nvidia installer on kernels such as these
[20:00] <PewPewPew> and remember to reinstall after each kernel upgrade (as long as you have headers)
[20:01] <BluesKaj> well , i'm not a gamer so i don't see much difference 
[20:01] <PewPewPew> Ya, I dont really care about that, I just wanted the ck patchset
[20:01] <PewPewPew> As I have been using Con Kolivas' work for over 10 years now
[20:02] <BluesKaj> I bought the graphics card to connect to our TV HDMI input 
[20:02] <PewPewPew> k
[20:03] <PewPewPew> This is just a buildbox/desktop in a 1U server
[20:03] <PewPewPew> And its all simple intel stuff, integrated, not APU
[20:03] <PewPewPew> GMA3500 and stuff, even on my thinkpad
[20:03] <BluesKaj> but using a debian kernel for graphics in my case wasn't the right choice 
[20:03] <PewPewPew> This sucks I bored my old ~/ dir, I have so much configuration to do
[20:04] <PewPewPew> borked*
[20:04] <BluesKaj> why not just reinstall to / ?
[20:04] <PewPewPew> Reinstall zsh, setup all my aliases, give sudo passwordless access (I dont allow zsh except from LAN
[20:05] <PewPewPew> BluesKaj:drive died
[20:05] <BluesKaj> ok 
[20:05] <PewPewPew> Now I got my 1U buildbox/desktop I grabbed on the cheap. And thats gonna be a desktp rather than my thinkpad
[20:05] <BluesKaj> zsh ?
[20:05] <PewPewPew> Yes, I love zsh
[20:05] <PewPewPew> Myuch more powerful than bash imho
[20:05] <BluesKaj> oh
[20:07] <PewPewPew> brb. need to reboot or relogin totally to get zsh fully going

[20:19] <leonardocr> BluesKaj, I don't understand
[20:21] <BluesKaj> leonardocr, I was trying to invoke the factoid bot , like this 
[20:21] <BluesKaj> !uck
[20:21] <ubottu> uck is a tool that helps you customise official Ubuntu Live CDs (including Kubuntu/Xubuntu and Edubuntu) to your needs. See http://uck.sourceforge.net/
[20:22] <BluesKaj> but there used to be another tool to do so , but I've forgotten the name
[20:25] <BluesKaj> !remastersys
[20:25] <BluesKaj> hmm
[20:26] <Unit193> !remaster
[20:26] <ubottu> Interested in remastering the Ubuntu !LiveCD or !Alternate installer? See: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization - Or use tools such as http://uck.sourceforge.net/ or http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/DRU_Disc_Remastering_Utility
[20:27] <BluesKaj> leonardocr, http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Fully-Customized-Live-Kde-Cd/Dvd-Using-Kubuntu
[20:28] <leonardocr> ahh, ok BluesKaj, but I used uck with kubuntu 13.04 but I get an error when it is creating the iso
[20:29] <BluesKaj> leonardocr, that tutorial uses remastersys 
[20:31] <BluesKaj> looks like a lot of work to me , don't think I can be bothered
[20:36] <leonardocr> BluesKaj, I followed that tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization, but finally when I was testing, I get an error
[20:45] <Guest40539> Hello

[20:47] <frantic_> cool
[20:47] <Guest40539> Yeah. Does kubuntu have a software center
[20:53] <genii> Guest40539: It uses muon by default, same idea
