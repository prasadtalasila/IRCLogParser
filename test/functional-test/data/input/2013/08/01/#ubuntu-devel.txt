[04:47] <pitti> Good morning
[04:47] <pitti> dobey: as cjwatson says, "build-needed" does a complete normal package build without any DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
[04:56] <Snow-Man> pitti: just fyi, I'm all over #718460 already. :)
[05:00] <pitti> Snow-Man: oh, nice! thanks
[05:02] <Snow-Man> yea, np.
[05:02] <Snow-Man> a fix should be in our next point release.
[05:11] <pitti> mbiebl, slangasek: oh, http://packages.qa.debian.org/libu/libusbx/news/20130731T190350Z.html -- I'm syncing that now
[05:13] <mbiebl> pitti: I already have that version :-/
[05:14] <mbiebl> pitti: I'm not sure if it's the upower deadlock though
[05:14] <mbiebl> since upower -d now works just fine
[05:14] <pitti> mbiebl: ah, so at least libusbx was fixed for good?
[05:15] <mbiebl> well, not sure
[05:15] <mbiebl> dbus-send --print-reply             --system             --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower             /org/freedesktop/UPower             org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend
[05:15] <mbiebl> Error org.freedesktop.UPower.GeneralError: Sleep has already been requested and is pending
[05:16] <pitti> upower does that if the previous resume failed, do you have anything in pm-suspend.log?
[05:16] <mbiebl> might be a different issue
[05:16] <mbiebl> I get that after the first suspend
[05:16] <mbiebl> the missing Resuming signal also means
[05:16] <mbiebl> that NM doesn't properly wake up

[08:19] <seb128> hum
[08:19] <seb128> what's the right place to ask for morphis to be banned the time for the join/part flood to stop?
[08:19] <seb128> there is an IRC op channel? (I don't remember the details)
[08:20] <Laney> #ubuntu-irc iirc
[08:25] <seb128> Laney, thanks, asked there
[08:27] <slangasek> cjwatson: http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html says autopkgtest for upower 0.9.21-1 is running; following the link to jenkins says it finished hours ago after 2 minutes; where is this stuck?
[08:30] <pitti> (same for gvfs test)
[08:31] <pitti> I had several of those yesterday evening, they cleared up over night
[08:31] <pitti> but somewhere there's a huge propagation delay, much more than just the publisher delay
[08:31] <pitti> jibel: ^
[08:50] <pitti> seb128: oh, libgphoto and its rdepends tail are just being propagated
[08:50] <pitti> mah, how did we *ever* deal with transitions without our staging magic
[08:50] <seb128> pitti, did the jenkins status finally update?
[08:51] <pitti> seb128: mostly, yes; it still considers the upower test running, but the gphoto related ones are done
[08:51] <seb128> pitti, are you sure it's going through?
[08:52] <pitti> seb128: I got an "accepted" for wine1.4, and excuses says "valid candidate"
[08:52] <seb128> pitti, http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_output.txt lists "    * i386: ia32-libs-multiarch"
[08:52] <pitti> not sure why it would promote wine first without the libraries
[08:52] <pitti> oh-uh
[08:52] <pitti> bug!
[08:52] <seb128> pitti, weird, output has it as FAILED, maybe the next refresh
[08:52] <pitti> that means wine1.4 in saucy is now broken
[08:54] <pitti> seb128: ia32-libs? isn't that a thing from the distant past??
[08:54] <pitti> oh dear, why do we still have that package
[08:54] <seb128> pitti, it's still in the archive...
[08:54] <slangasek> pitti: it's a transitional metapackage now
[08:55] <pitti> we had that in precise already
[08:55] <xnox> -multiarch does cross-arch build-dependencies, and i don't think britney does not consider cross-arch/multi-arch dependencies...
[08:55] <pitti> so I guess we can kill it, as we don't support upgrades with skipping LTSes?
[08:55] <slangasek> pitti: so if you want to kill it, ok with me :)
[08:55] <pitti> so it's "fix" (trivial) or kill, does anyone see a reason to keep it?
[08:56]  * seb128 hands pitti a sword
[08:56] <pitti> no rdepends on i386 and amd64
[08:56] <seb128> killit!
[08:56] <pitti> $ remove-package -m 'obsolete transitional package' ia32-libs
[08:56]  * pitti sheds a tear
[08:56] <pitti> I'm honored
[08:57] <seb128> ;-)
[08:57] <pitti> I'm still baffled why britney propagated wine1.4; it clearly depends on libgphoto2-6, so is uninstallable in saucy without also promoting libgphoto2
[08:58] <pitti> or maybe, /me checks
[08:59] <pitti> indeed, seems with the rebuild it lots its binary dep, although configure confirmed gphoto support
[09:00] <pitti> no, I mis-looked; it does depend on libgphoto2-6 (>= 2.4.10.1)
[09:00] <seb128> pitti, that's weird ... britney bug?

[09:18] <didrocks> I don't remember of that discussion at all, so I'm either senile either there are some confusion
[09:18] <Riddell> hmm, someone else
[09:18] <Riddell> must check logs

[09:19] <Laney> you should just file an MP :-)
[09:19] <Riddell> stgraber: were you not going to add plasma to upstart-xsessions?
[09:32] <seb128> pitti, great, britney is happy, libgphoto moving to saucy release this time
[09:32] <seb128> libusbx less happy though, it's still written as "autopkgtest for upower 0.9.21-1: RUNNING "
[09:33] <seb128> when the test finished to run for hours
[09:36] <debfx> Riddell: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kde-workspace/4:4.10.3-0ubuntu4 ?
[09:36] <Riddell> debfx: also needs added to /etc/upstart-xsessions
=== tkamppeter_ is now known as tkamppeter
[09:37] <debfx> ah, right
[09:41] <seb128> cjwatson, jibel: any of you around? can you help with update_excuses having libusbx stucked on "autopkgtest for upower 0.9.21-1: RUNNING" when the test finished running for some hours?
[09:41] <jibel> seb128, looking
[09:41] <seb128> jibel, thanks
[09:45] <stgraber> Riddell: yes, I was. I was waiting for all the flavours to finish testing their desktop session under upstart, I think everyone did but Lubuntu, so I'll ping Julien about it and then switch it on for everyone
[09:46] <Riddell> stgraber: remind me again of the advantage?
[09:47] <xnox> Riddell: you can open terminal, type $ stop, to logout desktop session =) should work with new neon/framework5 =)
[09:48] <Riddell> that'll be handy, frameworks 5 makes it hard to leave
[09:49] <stgraber> Riddell: main advantage is that any other upstart job written for the ubuntu desktop will magically work for you too, it also makes some advanced desktop scripting easier for some users (you can have offlineimap start when network-manager is connected and you have a usb stick plugged in, ...)
[09:50] <stgraber> Riddell: upstart also enforces a clean parent/child relationship, so processes that double-fork for some reason will keep the upstart user session as their parent and not be moved to pid1
[09:50] <stgraber> Riddell: so logout tends to be quite a bit cleaner (as everything under upstart gets killed leaving no processes behind)
[09:50] <slangasek> right, so pulseaudio won't evade capture ;)
[09:55] <unixpro1970> the problem with upstart is when a process forks more 3 or more times,  it has a problem tracking the correct process.
[09:55] <unixpro1970> 3 or more
[10:01] <cjwatson> slangasek,seb128: Yeah, this is all in adt-britney and is really something jibel needs to look at - we can force it if need be but would be better if it were fixed properly
[10:01] <slangasek> ack
[10:03] <xnox> unixpro1970: in user-session, we use prctl and set PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER, thus we guard _all_ user session processes to be parented to user session upstart at most.
[10:03] <xnox> unixpro1970: nothing should need to fork more than three times, and that's easy to avoid and test, when create upstart jobs....

[10:16] <unixpro1970> Good to know, thanks
[10:16] <jibel> seb128, aggregation failed because version of the package tested was a version behind what has been requested.

[12:16] <xnox> rbasak: my threshold is low: no pointless uploads. This one is new upstream release (e.g. not just cosmetic packaging changes) & fixes a bug 1092548. So i'd try to sync it / sponsor sync, if it builds on saucy etc.

[12:16] <rbasak> xnox: OK, I'll build test and sponsor if it works then. Thanks!
[12:17] <xnox> rbasak: also I'd do syncs that get packages in sync (e.g. ubuntu has -2ubuntu1 upload, debian does -3 with our -2ubuntu1 changes, I'd sync it, to not forget / allow further [auto-]syncs in the future)

[16:29] <xnox> 1sec =)
[16:31] <xnox> doko: DEB_BUILD_PARALLEL, if set, allow activating parallel builds in certain classes (makefile, automake, perlmodule, qmake, cmake, and scons classes use build commands supporting parallel builds). CDBS then uses DEB_PARALLEL_JOBS to know how many builds to launch (which defaults to parallel= parameter in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, but can be overridden).
[16:31] <xnox> doko: "DEB_BUILD_PARALLEL = yes" should do it....

[17:02] <xnox> smoser: if you have a shared bzr repo and/or precise branches locally. you should check if you have that revision locally. e.g. $ bzr log -rrevid:smoser@ubuntu.com-20130118151237-7jeas9368k0vdy84 and then try to push it.....
[17:02] <utlemming> cjwatson: lol....sure
[17:02] <smoser> i do.
[17:02] <smoser> where would i "share" ?
[17:02] <cjwatson> (Yes, it's a bug, but since Launchpad had its maintenance team forcibly hacked down to minimal size, it's kind of hard to support all this stuff)
[17:03] <xnox> smoser: there were hidden commands to upload stuff to repositories.
[17:03]  * xnox tries to recall
[17:04] <smoser> xnox, so i just did:
[17:04] <smoser> bzr branch -r smoser@ubuntu.com-20130118151237-7jeas9368k0vdy84 precise.sru xfoo
[17:04] <smoser> cd xfoo
[17:04] <smoser> so i can presumably bzr push that somewhere ?
[17:04] <xnox> smoser: can you try $ bzr push lp:ubuntu/precise/cloud-init it should take some time to figure out that it needs it & should pick it up. Unless it wont...
[17:05]  * xnox looks for the other command to upload ghosts.
[17:05] <xnox> utlemming: actually does branching work if you disable launchpad plugin that checks version history?!
[17:06] <xnox> utlemming: bzr branch --no-plugins https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/precise/cloud-init/precise             <- works
[17:07] <xnox> smoser: never-mind, it's the launchpad bzr plugin that walks too far to get the revision history and check if things are up to date. The branch in question is actually fine.
[17:07] <cjwatson> Ha.  Fancy UI gets us into trouble again
[17:08] <smoser> fixed!
[17:08] <utlemming> xnox: yup, I'm getting what I expect now
[17:08] <smoser> for lp:ubuntu/precise/cloud-init
[17:09] <utlemming> xnox: with disabling the plugins
[17:09] <xnox> smoser: ship it! =)
[17:09] <smoser> agreed

[17:11] <smoser> hm..
[17:11] <smoser> xnox,
[17:11] <xnox> Hmm... can't find robru anywhere
[17:11] <smoser> now in trying to push a -proposed
[17:11] <smoser> $ bzr push lp:ubuntu/precise-proposed/cloud-init
[17:11] <smoser> bzr: ERROR: Server sent an unexpected error: ('error', 'xmlrpclib.Fault', '<Fault -1: "Unexpected Zope exception: TypeError: (\'Could not adapt\', <SuiteSourcePackage ubuntu/precise-proposed/cloud-init>, <InterfaceClass lp.code.interfaces.branchtarget.IBranchTarget>)">')
[17:12] <xnox> smoser: that's correct. -proposed doesn't exist yet.
[17:12] <smoser> so how do i create it?
[17:12] <xnox> smoser: by uploading a package.
[17:12] <cjwatson> SRU workflow for UDD was never nice.  You need to push to a personal namespace.
[17:12] <smoser> well, there have been 5 preivous uploads there.
[17:12] <xnox> smoser: oh.
[17:12] <cjwatson> lp:~smoser/ubuntu/precise-proposed/cloud-init/blah
[17:12] <smoser> cjwatson, really? how does it work then ?
[17:13] <smoser> i've seen other things that i bzr branch'd
[17:13] <smoser> i think
[17:13] <cjwatson> Maybe it works if the importer hasn't been broken.
[17:13] <xnox> smoser: importer fails, because of tag missmatches
[17:13] <xnox> smoser: so cloud-init branches are stale: http://package-import.ubuntu.com/status/cloud-init.html#2012-07-04 20:18:13.838295
[17:14] <xnox> utlemming: lp:ubuntu/*/cloud-init are out of date. use $ pull-lp-source cloud-init precise
=== sabdfl_ is now known as sabdfl
[17:15] <smoser> so how would we fix that mismatch ?
[17:15] <smoser> can't i just push override the thing?
[17:20] <xnox> smoser: that's what causes the missmatch. udd stores old tag revids in sql database, when they don't match what's in lp:ubuntu/package udd throws a hizzy fit
[17:20] <xnox> smoser: lp:udd =)
[17:20] <smoser> xnox, http://paste.ubuntu.com/5937102/
[17:20] <smoser> that is what it doesn't like.
[17:23] <xnox> smoser: pull-lp-source cloud-init 0.6.2-0ubuntu1 doesn't have that file either. Plus it's evil to do that with 3.0 (quilt) format, as the branch no longer follows udd convention of patches applied.
[17:23] <smoser> xnox, right.
[17:23] <smoser> its when i was fighting the importer
[17:23] <smoser> i gave up at some point.
[17:23] <smoser> i relaly think its silly to revision control .pc
[17:24] <smoser> but i gave up fighting a robot over that.
[17:24] <xnox> it's kind of like slangasek using git-bzr to push packages into lp:ubuntu/* with empty directories, which git ignored yet package had and bzr noticed /o\
[17:24]  * xnox all your .pc are belong to us
[17:26] <xnox> smoser: i can purge all branches, and make udd reimport them, but all human commits/pushes will be forgotten.
[17:26] <xnox> smoser: but branches will become up-to-date based on package history.
[17:28] <smoser> xnox, i'm actually fine with that. if it works.
[17:29] <smoser> as long as it wont cause issue with lp:cloud-init
[17:29] <smoser> concern is if they have staked branch history or something.
[17:32] <xnox> smoser: nah, udd only can access lp:ubuntu/* branches and they do not share history with lp:$projects at all.
[17:32] <smoser> xnox, then do it.
[17:33] <smoser> i'd happily , *very happily* let the import robot win
[18:20] <dobey> kenvandine: is there a trivial (simple) example of simply requesting credentials for a service, from UOA?

[18:26] <kenvandine> dobey, ^^
[18:26] <kenvandine> dobey, there is also a QML example in accounts-qml-module
[18:29] <dobey> python is what i wanted. but that isn't exactly trivial :)
[18:32] <smoser> xnox, can you / did you kick that importer ?
[19:50] <Noskcaj> kirkland, i think the best option for testdrive translations is to re-make the .pot and start from scratch
[19:51] <kirkland> Noskcaj: okay -- then I agree!
[19:51]  * kirkland is clueless on translations
[19:52] <Noskcaj> kirkland, We currently have three ones, all with outdated .pot files. the bzr branch, the launchpad translations and the .orig release
[19:52] <kirkland> Noskcaj: okay;  wouldn't it be best to use LP translations?
[19:52] <Noskcaj> kirkland, yes, and we still would
[20:10] <kirkland> Noskcaj: cool
[20:17] <Noskcaj> kirkland, it seems i'm worse at making .pot files than you.
[20:24] <kirkland> Noskcaj: do you need anything else from me, at this point, to proceed?
[20:25] <Noskcaj> I'll continue trying to get this working. I'll need to be part of lp:~testdrive to finish it though
[20:25] <kirkland> okay
[20:26] <kirkland> Noskcaj: remind me of your lp id?
[20:27] <Noskcaj> ~noskcaj
[20:27] <kirkland> Noskcaj: okay, added

[20:29] <dobey> does autopkgtest get run on armhf for anything?
[20:47] <gQuigs> I was wondering if all the desktop related lucid bugs on here: http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html could just be closed

[20:50] <xnox> dobey: no. only i386/amd64. armhf tests are setup and operated separately by pes, e.g. autopilot tests.

[20:53] <dobey> oh ok
[20:54] <smoser> xnox, thank you.
[20:57] <Noskcaj> kirkland, worrying thing i just found in testdrive; we've been translating most lines twice, the testdrive-gtk file is redundant
