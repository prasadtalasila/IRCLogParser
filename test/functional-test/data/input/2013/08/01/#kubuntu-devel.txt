[03:36] <smartboyhw> ScottK, when can you approve the in-queue raring SRU for ibus-cangjie for me?
[03:51] <smartboyhw> Season of KDE... Any ideas as to how to join?
[03:55] <valorie> do you have a project in mind?
[03:56] <valorie> and a willing mentor?
[03:56] <valorie> we're not quite ready for students to sign up, but the announcement will be published Any Time Now
[03:56] <smartboyhw> valorie, the problem is no and no. (I don't know who really wants to be a mentor of me)
[03:57] <valorie> think about a project that will take you between one and two months
[03:57] <smartboyhw> em.......
[03:57] <valorie> and we'll try to find you a mentor if you can't find one
[03:58] <smartboyhw> BTW, someone add the new SSH key from my Launchpad profile to the KDE sftp plz (yes, again)
[03:58] <valorie> it can be programming, but it doesn't have to be
[03:59] <smartboyhw> And is anybody doing Calligra 2.7.1 ?
[04:02] <smartboyhw> valorie, I will not try a programming project..
[04:02] <smartboyhw> My programming is crap
[04:02] <valorie> heh
[04:03] <smartboyhw> valorie, yeah....
[04:04] <valorie> so what do you like to do?
[04:05] <valorie> I think packaging is not on the list of possible projects
[04:05] <smartboyhw> valorie, I know :P
[04:05] <smartboyhw> Probably doc
[04:06] <smartboyhw> http://community.kde.org/Getinvolved
[04:06] <smartboyhw> Sounds like the only thing I can do (non-dev wise)
[04:06] <smartboyhw> translations takes me 3 months:P
[04:06] <smartboyhw> And my art is ****
[04:07] <valorie> is there anything you like (an application, an area) that lacks good documentation?
[04:07] <valorie> that's how I got involved in the first place: user docs for Amarok
[04:08] <smartboyhw> Let me see...
[04:10] <smartboyhw> valorie, I don't know, really. 
[04:11] <valorie> you might ask on the KDE docs list
[04:12] <valorie> I'd suggest the IRC channel, but there is little discussion there
[04:12] <smartboyhw> valorie, is there any list of previous projects for SoK 2012?
[04:12] <valorie> oddly enough, the mail list is: https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-doc-english
[04:13] <smartboyhw> valorie, oddly?
[04:14] <valorie> http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2012/Ideas
[04:14] <valorie> I think it's odd that the main list is called KDE-Doc-English
[04:14] <smartboyhw> valorie, eh hum GSoC != SoK !?
[04:16] <valorie> I guess googling in general is the only way to get a list
[04:16] <valorie> however, there are lots of reports
[04:17] <valorie> it's true that in general SoK projects are smaller than GSoK
[04:17] <smartboyhw> valorie, oh reports, where're they?
[04:17] <valorie> I mean GSoC
[04:18] <valorie> I googled for "projects for SoK 2012"
[04:18] <valorie> and got quite a few individual, different hits
[04:21] <smartboyhw> valorie, email sent to the KDE Doc list
[04:21] <valorie> nice
[04:29] <smartboyhw> valorie, ooh
[04:29] <smartboyhw> Moreover, as Kubuntu was mentioned, can you look into Muon and document its usage if you find this appropriate.
[04:29] <smartboyhw> In a reply email
[04:29] <smartboyhw> Hmm, probably Muon then (LOL)
[04:30] <valorie> if you find a mentor, which.... seems like a slam-dunk
[04:31] <smartboyhw> valorie, which... ?
[04:31] <valorie> jontheechidna
[04:32] <valorie> the creator of muon
[04:32] <valorie> that sounds like a win win win for everyone
[04:38] <smartboyhw> valorie, yeah yeah :P
[04:41] <valorie> including you: tshirt, certificate, etc.
[04:45] <smartboyhw> valorie, and experience, that's more important la;P
[04:45] <valorie> of course
[04:45] <smartboyhw> So, wait for jontheechidna to come online then:P
[04:45] <valorie> or drop him an email
[04:46] <smartboyhw> valorie, if I can't see him when I sleep I will drop an email
[04:48] <valorie> echidnaman@kubuntu.org
[04:48] <smartboyhw> valorie, got it
[05:19] <smartboyhw> Hey JontheEchidna

[05:25] <smartboyhw> So, you are willing to be mentor right?
[05:26] <JontheEchidna> Yes

[06:01] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: can you reboot the server
[06:01] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, how?
[06:02] <smartboyhw> Actually I discovered that one of my web host server is down for maintenance sigh
[06:02] <shadeslayer> how would I know
[06:02] <shadeslayer> my VPS provides a reset button
[06:03] <shadeslayer> via the control panel thingy
[06:03] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, no. Can't find reset...
[06:04] <smartboyhw> Yeah, my server is down
[06:04] <smartboyhw> Due to maintenance
[06:04] <smartboyhw> Damn
[06:05] <valorie> woah
[06:05] <valorie> not even a nice "fixing, hang on" page
[06:06] <shadeslayer> hurrah
[06:06] <shadeslayer> yofel: I think I might have to recompile Qt against the new HWE stack to fix the kde-workspace FTBFS in precise
[06:07] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/p27df6da3/
[06:07] <shadeslayer> which probably makes sense tbh
[06:08] <smartboyhw> valorie, they do have a notice, IIRC:P
[06:08] <smartboyhw> Server #10 is under the maintenance
[06:08] <smartboyhw> We are currently performing a maintenance on the Server #10. It is estimated that this maintenance should be completed within 2-3 hours.
[06:08] <smartboyhw> Please do not submit and tickets about this issue and do not increase our work load as we are fully dedicated in resolving this server problem. We thank you for your patience and understanding.
[06:08] <smartboyhw> MEH
[06:09] <shadeslayer> o_o
[06:09] <shadeslayer> the most my VPS was down was for 6 hours
[06:09] <shadeslayer> when they were moving from SF to Las Vegas
[06:09] <shadeslayer> ( yeah my server is hosted in Las Vegas, sin city \o/ )

[06:42]  * shadeslayer tackles jussi for not putting more pictures of Elodi on G+
[06:43] <jussi> shadeslayer: cripes... how many dfo you want? :P
[06:43] <shadeslayer> I haven't seen any recent ones on G+ I think
[06:44] <shadeslayer> possibly the algorithm is broken, because I see loads of star wars and stuff
[06:45] <shadeslayer> jussi: also, there can never be enough :P
[06:45] <Tm_T> shadeslayer: there's reason I don't have star wars stuff in my circles on G+
[06:46] <shadeslayer> Tm_T: yeah, I think I'll have to remove that community
[06:46] <shadeslayer> it's overwhelming my feed
[06:46] <Tm_T> also it's mostly junk /:
[06:46] <shadeslayer> true ^^
[06:47] <shadeslayer> not to metnion, overly sexist
[06:47] <Tm_T> shadeslayer: as in, there' way more sane ways to follow SW
[06:47] <Tm_T> that
[06:47] <shadeslayer> I see
[06:49] <shadeslayer> agateau: are you around?
[06:49] <smartboyhw> Can anyone provide patch to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/amarok/2:2.7.90-0ubuntu1 plz?
[06:49] <smartboyhw> For the you know qreal thing
[06:49]  * shadeslayer looks
[06:50] <shadeslayer>   (found suitable version "4.8.4", minimum required is "4.8.2")
[06:50] <shadeslayer> what o_o
[06:50] <shadeslayer> ah
[06:50] <shadeslayer> opengl
[06:50] <smartboyhw> opengl
[06:50] <smartboyhw> ah
[06:50] <smartboyhw> What happened to opengl now?
[06:50] <smartboyhw> I mean, is it updated now?
[06:50] <shadeslayer> well
[06:50] <shadeslayer> there is no opengl on arm afaik
[06:50] <shadeslayer> there's only GLES
[06:51] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, ah yeah
[06:51] <smartboyhw> So, either we move it to -release, or it will be forever stuck:P
[06:52] <smartboyhw> We had this discussion before I left for UK
[06:52] <shadeslayer> ScottK: ^^ plz be forcing amarok
[06:52] <smartboyhw> And it is still here after I came back>>>>>>>
[06:52] <ScottK> smartboyhw: I can remove the arm binary, but forcing it causes more problems than it solves.
[06:53] <smartboyhw> ScottK, oh. Rm ARM binary then
[06:58] <smartboyhw> WHO DIDN"T UPDATE THE -l10n for 2.7.0!??!?!?
[06:58] <smartboyhw> Anyways
[06:59] <ScottK> Gone.
[07:00] <ScottK> Someone go make sure it's not seeded on arm now.
[07:00] <smartboyhw> I nominate yofel or shadeslayer 
[07:02] <smartboyhw> Or Riddell 
[07:04] <smartboyhw> Ouch, or rather: Why is calligra-l10n 2.7.0 stuck in proposed!/
[07:04] <smartboyhw> ScottK, can you unfreeze the calligra-l10n 2.7.0 stuck in proposed?
[07:05]  * ScottK looks to see why it's there.
[07:06] <smartboyhw> ScottK, and also (personal favor) approve ibus-cangjie in raring SRU queue.
[07:06] <smartboyhw> Sorry for making you doing a lot of things:P
[07:06] <ScottK> Not today.  It's 3AM here.
[07:07] <smartboyhw> ScottK, OK. 
[07:09] <ScottK> smartboyhw: I think the issue is that it's blocked on language-pack-kde-en due to calligra-l10n-engb being dropped.  Than lang pack needs to be fixed to not need that.
[07:09] <smartboyhw> ScottK, oh oh
[07:09] <ScottK> You need Riddell or apachelogger for that kind of thing, I think.
[07:09] <smartboyhw> OK, apachelogger Riddell ^^
[07:10] <smartboyhw> ScottK, wait. If I upload a 2.7.1 ver of calligra-l10n without calligra-l10n-engb and without language-pack-kde-en as build-dep
[07:10] <smartboyhw> will it get through?
[07:12] <smartboyhw> Or you mean that language-pack-kde-en is killed?
[07:13] <smartboyhw> Or you mean that language-pack-kde-en depends on calligra-l10n-engb?
[07:13]  * smartboyhw thinks the third
[07:16] <smartboyhw> OK I got it
[07:16]  * smartboyhw roars at the packages
[07:16] <smartboyhw> Can somebody kindly fix that?
[07:30] <lordievader> Good morning.
[07:32] <agateau> shadeslayer: I am there now
[07:32] <shadeslayer> ah hi
[07:33] <shadeslayer> agateau: is this all I need to do to setup codereviews in Qt https://qt-project.org/wiki/Setting-up-Gerrit
[07:33] <shadeslayer> and should I be using a branch for my commits and push that to gerrit?
[07:34] <agateau> shadeslayer: yes, this page is enough
[07:35] <shadeslayer> agateau: ack, and is there some sort of agreement that I have to sign?
[07:35] <agateau> one question at a time :)
[07:35] <agateau> shadeslayer: using branches is a good idea if you start multiple changes
[07:35] <shadeslayer> right :)
[07:35] <agateau> especially since it can take some back and forth before it is merged
[07:36] <agateau> but the trick is you don't push your branch to a branch named the same on gerrit
[07:36] <agateau> you push using "refs/for/$foo", where $foo is the name of the branch you want to get your patch in
[07:37] <agateau> so if you created a branch to add a new feature for the "dev" branch, you would push using "git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/dev"
[07:37] <agateau> this will give you an url for your change in the output of your push
[07:38] <agateau> whenever you change the fix, you update your commit (you don't create a new commit) and push again to the same refs/for/$foo
[07:38] <shadeslayer> uhm, isn't for/dev a common branch for everyone?
[07:38] <shadeslayer> and won't that conflict and what not? or does gerrit just post the diff from the current dev and adds a patch to reviewboard
[07:39] <agateau> "dev" is a common branch, "refs/for/dev" is gerrit magic to make it create a request, as I understand it
[07:39] <shadeslayer> okay
[07:40] <smartboyhw> valorie, http://season.kde.org/?q=program_home&prg=8
[07:40] <smartboyhw> LOL
[07:40] <valorie> yep, we're not quite ready
[07:40] <valorie> soon, soon
[07:40] <agateau> shadeslayer: regarding agreement: yes you need to agree to qt cla. this can be done online.
[07:41] <smartboyhw> Oops
[07:41] <smartboyhw> I clicked on "Apply to mentor" (I thought it was apply for student) DAMN
[07:41] <smartboyhw> valorie, plz get that off:P
[07:41] <agateau> shadeslayer: assuming you have an account on gerrit already, there is a page in your gerrit profile to do so
[07:41] <agateau> shadeslayer: it does not take long
[07:41] <shadeslayer> yep, was just looking at that
[07:46] <valorie> I'll see if I can, smartboyhw
[07:47] <valorie> rejected
[07:48] <smartboyhw> valorie, Your mentorship application has been declined and you cannot participate in this program does that mean I now can't even participate as student?
[07:48] <valorie> no
[07:48] <valorie> It means you tried to apply too early
[07:48] <smartboyhw> valorie, phew
[07:49] <valorie> I'm sure we'll pull the reset button before launching
[07:49] <valorie> I reported what happened just now, just in case
[07:49] <valorie> good to know that the email function is working
[08:04] <yofel> smartboyhw: rebuilding qt probably makes sense, but this is really apt-get's dependency resolver being crap in precise, aptitude resolves that fine
[08:04] <yofel> er, shadeslayer ^
[08:04] <shadeslayer> heh
[08:05] <yofel> I did manage to reproduce that with pbuilder-satisfydepends-classic, but didn't have time to do anything more than that
[08:31] <Quintasan> \o
[08:54] <Riddell> jussi: you pinged?
[09:04] <Riddell> hmm, qtwebkit built but with a new gl(es) error on arm
[09:25] <Riddell> we got our first donation!
[09:26] <Riddell> $30 turned into £29.10
[09:26] <Tm_T> woo
[09:27] <Riddell> no wait, £30 turned into £29.10 sent from a USD paypal account
[09:27] <Tm_T> Riddell: where's donation details? was going to add link to it to my email sig
[09:28] <Riddell> hmm no even worse, Net amount:	 £28.33 GBP
[09:28] <Riddell> Fee amount:	 -£1.67 GBP
[09:28] <Riddell> these paypal people know how to make money
[09:28] <Riddell> Tm_T: just made this yesterday, think it's good enough to launch? http://www.kubuntu.org/donate
[09:28] <jussi> Riddell: we should direct people to the Holvi thing. its 90c per transaction 
[09:29] <Riddell> jussi: mm have I heard of that?
[09:30] <Tm_T> Riddell: I'm ok with it, although I hope paypal isn't mandatory
[09:30] <jussi> Riddell: yeah, its the thing I have been planning to use as the tshirt selling platform - we talked about it before
[09:30] <jussi> with the open budget and all
[09:31] <Riddell> ah hah
[09:32] <Riddell> well this'll be good enough to get on with for now
[09:42] <agateau> Riddell: have you considered setting up a flattr account for Kubuntu?
[09:44] <Riddell> agateau: nope, baby steps
[09:44] <Riddell> agateau: do you think we'd get much money through flattr?
[09:44] <Riddell> ta da! kubuntu.org/news/now-open-donations
[09:45] <agateau> Riddell: I would not expect you'd get overflowed by donations, but more channels to receive money is always a good thing I guess, and you may also get people to subscribe to it (ie, automatically flattr kubuntu every month)
[09:46] <Riddell> another item for the todo :)
[09:47] <agateau> Riddell: link in the news is wrong
[09:47] <agateau> Riddell: it points to /news/donate instead of /donate
[09:47] <Riddell> well spotted, fixed
[09:50] <agateau> Riddell: just read planetkde... so my new nickname is "Aurélien Le Cake"? :)
[09:54] <jussi> Riddell: I put up some examples here: https://holvi.com/shop/Kubuntu/
[09:56] <jussi> Riddell: and the open budget you can see by clicking the link in the top corner, or here: https://holvi.com/avoinbudjetti/Kubuntu/
[09:58] <Riddell> ah yes, only Finland for now
[10:00] <jussi> Riddell: only finland for admin side - worldwide for actual payments and so on
[10:06] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yofel http://paste.kde.org/p2cc15469/ for Calligra, anything you think that shouldn't be there?
[10:07] <smartboyhw> It's 2.7.1 BTW
[10:08] <Riddell> smartboyhw: oh cool
[10:08] <Riddell> I think all those lintian issues are acceptable
[10:08] <smartboyhw> Yeah, packaging 1 day after I came back from London... Really busy:P
[10:08] <smartboyhw> Riddell, greato
[10:13]  * Riddell puts a banner on http://www.kubuntu.org/
[10:13] <smartboyhw> Riddell, can you fix the language-pack-base-en depend on calligra-l10n-engb problem
[10:16] <Riddell> smartboyhw: I think that needs calligra-l10n-engb removed from the archive
[10:16] <smartboyhw> Riddell, meh
[10:16] <smartboyhw> Riddell, you are archive admin, remove it:P
[10:17] <Riddell> all our calligra-l10n package are an old version
[10:17] <Riddell> smartboyhw: so first step is packagine 2.7.1
[10:17] <smartboyhw> Riddell, because 2.7.0 is stuck in -proposed
[10:17] <smartboyhw> Due to that problem
[10:17] <smartboyhw> So even if I upload anything, it will still be stuck
[10:18] <Riddell> ah, circular, the language-pack script looks to see what's in the archive
[10:19] <Riddell> well can be easily done by hand
[10:19] <smartboyhw> Riddell, hand = you:p
[10:19] <smartboyhw> Thank you:)
[10:20] <smartboyhw> BTW, what's the best way to branch the calligra-l10n 2.7.0 source so I can work on the 2.7.1 one?
[10:20] <smartboyhw> Download, rather
[10:21] <Riddell> smartboyhw: apt-get, download from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/calligra, it should be in bzr if I did it right
[10:21] <Riddell> kbzr co calligra
[10:21] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I mean -l10n
[10:21] <smartboyhw> Not the main one
[10:21] <smartboyhw> Almost finishing the main here
[10:22] <Riddell> oh I had a script for that
[10:22] <Riddell> calligra-l10n-package in kubuntu-automation
[10:23] <smartboyhw> Riddell, :O
[10:23] <smartboyhw> Oops
[10:23] <smartboyhw> LOL
[10:23]  * Riddell runs dput ubuntu language-pack-kde-en_13.10+20130705.0ubuntu1_source.changes
[10:32] <agateau> mmm, that qtchooser thing is getting on my nerves. How do I get qmlscene to open a silly qtquick2 example?
[10:33] <agateau> it complains about QtQuick not being installed, even if I have libqt5quick5 installed
[10:34] <smartboyhw> Riddell, eh hum add back my SSH key to the ftpmaster.kde.org plz (yes, my computer can't boot when I came back, so...)
[10:36] <smartboyhw> It's in my LP page launchpad.net/~smartboyhw
[10:36] <Riddell> smartboyhw: mm I wouldn't have removed it
[10:36] <smartboyhw> Riddell, it's new
[10:36] <smartboyhw> Shouldn't have used the word "back"
[10:37] <Riddell> I see smartboyhw@smartboyhw-Compaq-Presario-CQ41-Notebook-PC is on there

[10:37] <Riddell> smartboyhw: remove your old one?
[10:37] <smartboyhw> The changes are on the kubuntu-packaging branch already
[10:37] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I removed it already.
[10:38] <smartboyhw> Or you mean in ftpmaster.kde.org
[10:38] <smartboyhw> ?
[10:38] <Riddell> smartboyhw: key added
[10:39] <smartboyhw> Riddell, thank you
[10:39] <smartboyhw> Good, the script now works
[10:40] <smartboyhw> That script is real great!
[10:43] <smartboyhw> Riddell, got anytime to review the calligra 2.7.1 package?
[10:43] <Riddell> smartboyhw: yep, anything changed since 2.7.0?
[10:44] <smartboyhw> Riddell, you mean the packaging or?
[10:44] <Riddell> yeah packaging
[10:44] <smartboyhw> The packaging changes are in the kubuntu-packaging branch
[10:44] <smartboyhw> Basically the qreal patch dropped (included in upstream)
[10:44] <smartboyhw> And some files removed from install files
[10:44] <smartboyhw> Nothing much
[10:45] <Riddell> /usr/share/kde4/apps/mime/packages/krita.xml disappeared?
[10:45] <Riddell> hmm and libkochart too?
[10:47] <smartboyhw> Riddell, eh heh.
[10:47] <smartboyhw> Maybe I should check the build logs
[10:48] <smartboyhw> Nothing special except I think a new build-dep
[10:49] <smartboyhw> Which I've never heard of...
[10:49] <smartboyhw> It's optional
[10:49] <smartboyhw> And doesn't even exist within Ubuntu repos
[10:50] <Riddell> opensomething?
[10:50] <Riddell> it's not got an upstream release
[10:50] <Riddell> so the upstream (who is both calligra and opensomething) said to leave it for now
[10:51] <smartboyhw> Riddell, uh hum then those files are REALLY missing then
[10:52] <smartboyhw> hot says:
[10:52] <smartboyhw> Should the support for PowerPC Desktop be continued?
[10:52] <smartboyhw> Yes, continue support - 20.7% (167 votes)
[10:52] <smartboyhw> No, don't support and bury it - 79.3% (639 votes)
[10:52] <smartboyhw> so Ubuntu Desktop discontinued powerpc
[10:52] <smartboyhw> Hmm..... (smartboyhw wants to re-mention killing it for Kubuntu)
[10:53] <Riddell> where is that?
[10:53] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com
[10:53] <smartboyhw> A Russian survery
[10:53] <Riddell> [ubuntu/saucy] calligra-l10n 1:2.7.0-0ubuntu1 (Accepted)  ta da
[10:53] <smartboyhw> + former announcements about killing
[10:53] <Riddell> just in time for 2.7.1 :)
[10:53] <smartboyhw> Riddell, \o/
[10:54] <smartboyhw> srsly, should we kill ppc?
[10:55] <Riddell> I'd be all for it
[10:55]  * smartboyhw is for PPC
[10:55] <smartboyhw> Killing I mean
[10:55] <Riddell> micahg: kde-workspace change made, debian agreed it should be added
[10:55] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I am suggesting to put forward to Kubuntu Council for a vote:P
[10:55] <Riddell> kwin-style-crystal uploaded
[10:55] <apachelogger> the only reason we have ppc still is becasue the case was made that since we have builds and as long as someone QAs the iso there is no reason not to have ppc
[10:56] <apachelogger> so I suppose we are rather indifferent :P
[10:57] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, so?
[10:57] <smartboyhw> Damn, why am I included in the elementary-l10n-council!?!?
[10:57] <smartboyhw> What the
[11:01] <smartboyhw> Anyways, I will start a discussion about Kubuntu PPC builds on kubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com. Anyone object?
[11:02] <Riddell> go ahead
[11:08] <apachelogger> what's there to discuss?
[11:10] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, bury it?
[11:13] <apachelogger> why would we discuss this in a kubuntu scope?
[11:13]  * apachelogger thinks a pointer to the ubutnu-devel discussion is what should be sent to kubuntu-devel
[11:13] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, why shouldn't we?
[11:14] <apachelogger> because we cannot discuss whether to kill a build architecture, that's a discussion that needs to happen at global ubuntu project scope
[11:15] <apachelogger> we can discuss whether to kill our ppc iso, which we did not too long ago as I mentioned earlier
[11:15] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, I mean to kill the PPC ISO ofc
[11:15] <apachelogger> we did that
[11:15] <apachelogger> answer is no
[11:15] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, but that is before Ubuntu decided to drop desktop PPC
[11:15] <apachelogger> <apachelogger> the only reason we have ppc still is becasue the case was made that since we have builds and as long as someone QAs the iso there is no reason not to have ppc
[11:17] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, I know.
[11:17] <smartboyhw> But I think that needs to change.
[11:17] <apachelogger> right
[11:17] <apachelogger> so here's how I will dismantle any argument you could bring up
[11:18] <apachelogger> ... some time ago we decided that we want to keep ppc as  long as we can and as long as we get actual release/iso QA for it
[11:19] <apachelogger> so unless we cannot keep ppc anymore (i.e. the build architecture was dropped from launchpad or put into ports or whatever) or we have a lack of QA suddenly I ask you why your opinion should outweigh the combined opinion of the community as previously stated.
[11:19] <smartboyhw> And then I will object in the QA part.
[11:19] <smartboyhw> Really.
[11:20] <apachelogger> lol?
[11:20] <apachelogger> pleas go ahead :P
[11:22] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[11:33] <smartboyhw> Sent.
[11:38] <Quintasan> apachelogger++
[11:41] <Tm_T> smartboyhw: about powerpc images: I haven't managed to get lubuntu running on my machine
[11:41] <Tm_T> maybe I should try the last kubuntu build
[11:41] <smartboyhw> Tm_T, you mean Alpha 2?
[11:41] <smartboyhw> If yes, it is broken
[11:42] <Tm_T> smartboyhw: I mean tested release
[11:42] <smartboyhw> They say they will fix it
[11:42] <smartboyhw> Tm_T, you mean Alpha 2 or 13.04
[11:42] <smartboyhw> ?
[11:42] <Tm_T> I mean 13.04, 12.10 and what else I already tried
[11:42] <smartboyhw> Tm_T, :O
[11:42] <smartboyhw> That's quite a problem
[11:42] <Tm_T> installs fine, then fails to boot with kernel errors
[11:43] <smartboyhw> You should tell the Lubuntu guys:P
[11:43] <Tm_T> I should first pinpoint the issue and make sure it's not my hardware though
[11:43] <smartboyhw> Riddell, is calligra OK?
[12:14] <smartboyhw> Riddell, if you have uploaded calligra 2.7.1 then here's https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/ppa/+files/calligra-l10n_2.7.1-0ubuntu1.dsc for you
[12:20] <smartboyhw> And someone please deal with https://code.launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/ubuntu-seeds/kubuntu.saucy.rm.amarok.armhf/+merge/178054
[12:23] <apachelogger> ^ I think markey fixed opengl requirement upstream already
[12:26] <Tm_T> aaand yet again, in one building, ~5000 people competing and gaming, 4 days http://www.assemblytv.net/pages/player?file=hd.stream&height=720&width=1280

[12:27] <kubotu> ::workspace-bugs:: [1206176] Powerdevil does not start, linking problem? @ https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1206176 (by aydin demircioglu)
[12:27] <smartboyhw> OK, then may apachelogger fix it:P
[12:27] <smartboyhw> I mean patch it to current version
[12:28] <markey> apachelogger: yes, fixed
[12:28] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: is armhf seed building failing right now?
[12:28] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, not yet, but ScottK told me to do so:P
[12:28] <apachelogger> ah, well just wait for new amarok :P
[12:28] <apachelogger> we have a prerelease right now anyway
[12:28] <smartboyhw> <ScottK> Someone go make sure it's not seeded on arm now.
[12:28] <smartboyhw> :)
[12:29] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, oh really?
[12:29] <apachelogger> ScottK: isn't the seed architecture stuff for stuff we do not want on the seed for seed reasons? like say grub-pc on armhf
[12:29] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: yes
[12:30] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, meh, let me package it then:)
[12:30] <smartboyhw> Is it in ftpmaster?
[12:46] <ScottK> Images will fail until it's fixed.
[12:46] <ScottK> Once we have a new  amarok, we can add it back.
[12:47] <ScottK> There will also have to be a kubuntu-meta upload. 
[12:54] <ScottK> I'm away from my computer, so someone please do the merge.

[13:32] <smartboyhw> Darkwing_ (in a G+ post): As of this last week I have migrated my desktop to #Fedora #KDE. 
[13:32] <smartboyhw> MEH!
[13:32] <smartboyhw> I'm not fully leaving #Kubuntu but, I'll be far scaled back and far removed. 
[13:32] <smartboyhw> :(
[13:32] <smartboyhw> Stay Kubuntu Darkwing_ !!!
[13:50] <Riddell> smartboyhw: does he say why?
[13:50] <smartboyhw> Riddell, if you mean Darkwing, um
[13:50] <smartboyhw> Riddell, The reason for this is twofold. First it was time for a change of pace. I have never used a #RedHat based system and need to learn more and second, I was getting tired of the petty infighting happening within the ubuntusphere.
[13:51] <smartboyhw> Uh hum:P
[13:55] <Riddell> hmm
[13:55] <Riddell> more than petty alas
[13:56] <smartboyhw> Riddell, OK.... (/me still waits for the calligra reviews)
[13:56] <smartboyhw> And should I also run the script to update kubuntu-meta or?
[13:56] <smartboyhw> Wait, you need to merge it first
[13:57] <Riddell> smartboyhw: calligra good, uploading now
[13:57] <smartboyhw> Riddell, :)
[13:57] <Riddell> yeah I'll do that next
[13:57] <Riddell> I had backported calligra 2.7.0 to raring
[13:57] <Riddell> would be worth doing thatwith 2.7.1
[13:59] <smartboyhw> Riddell, good.
[14:00] <smartboyhw> Um, I forgotten that backport function existing in ubuntu-dev-tools again...
[14:00] <smartboyhw> Anyways, just do a changelog upate
[14:01] <smartboyhw> s/upate/update/
[14:01] <kubotu> smartboyhw meant: "Anyways, just do a changelog update"
[14:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, backport to quantal and precise too? (Without vc-dev as build-dep?)
[14:06] <Riddell> smartboyhw: I might well have done those
[14:06] <Riddell> well not quantal,never seen any point in backpointing to that
[14:07] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yeah, you've done Precise
[14:12] <smartboyhw> Riddell, OOPS I uploaded to wrong PPA......
[14:12] <smartboyhw> I should have done it in backports and instead I did it to the main one.
[14:13] <Riddell> doh
[14:13] <Riddell> smartboyhw: can you delete that?
[14:13] <yofel> delete it while it's not published
[14:13] <yofel> the it won't matter
[14:13] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I think I can copy and delete
[14:13] <yofel> *then
[14:14] <smartboyhw> It will take some time to copy to there....:P
[14:16] <smartboyhw> OK, it's copied.
[14:16] <smartboyhw> DELETE
[14:18] <smartboyhw> DONE
[14:27] <smartboyhw> Riddell, backported to raring, quantal, precise (including -l10n)
[14:29] <smartboyhw> OK, what TODO?
[14:31] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you just put them in the PPA without testing I guess?  that's fine but mind and keep an eye on it for failures
[14:31] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I know. I at least removed vc-dev for quantal and precise, so less chance of failing.
[14:32] <smartboyhw> But, GCC and that sort of stuff
[14:32] <smartboyhw> SIGH
[14:33] <smartboyhw> Ha, I know why the image builds don't fail even with Amarok out of armhf sight: It's still stuck in -proposed
[14:34] <smartboyhw> Riddell, plz unstuck Amarok 2.7.90 in -proposed
[14:35] <Riddell> smartboyhw: what's stuck about it?
[14:37] <smartboyhw> Riddell, no opengl exist in armhf. ScottK removed the armhf binaries, but obviously it's still stuck
[14:49] <soee> guys atm custom background image for login screen does not work right ?
[14:49] <soee> only white background shows up
[14:49] <soee> *saucy
[14:54] <tester56> vHanda, are you there?
[14:54] <tester56> does anybody know how to get appmenu-gtk working on saucy?
[14:54] <genii> soee: I have a custom background which is working fine. I'm using lightdm-kde-greeter, not kdm though.
[14:55] <tester56> i have tried to install aindicator-appmenu ... no success exporting a gtk menu
[14:55] <soee> genii, lightdm is used by default i think
[14:57] <tester56> and I think appmenu-gtk was obsoleted for unity-gtk-module 
[14:57] <tester56> any idea if this can work on kubuntu?
[14:58] <tester56> Riddell, any idea? , as you have been involved on launchpad
[15:04] <Riddell> tester56: yeah I think appmenu-gtk is now dead
[15:04] <Riddell> it should still work for kde apps
[15:05] <tester56> yeah but that's only half of the fun
[15:05] <Riddell> but gtk apps you'll need to live with a menu bar on (I assume it has a sensible fallback)
[15:05] <Riddell> tester56: I uploaded kde-workspace with your suggested plasma login change, testing would be good when it arrives in the archive
[15:05] <tester56> in neon it worked
[15:06] <tester56> so, there is no chance to get appmenu-gtk for saucy?
[15:08]  * smartboyhw decides to upload quantal 4.10.97 to ninjas:P (Any objections?)
[15:08] <yofel> staging please
[15:09] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh yeah staging/
[15:09] <smartboyhw> Then why is precise in ninjas?
[15:09] <yofel> because staging is full
[15:09] <yofel> we have no PPA that can hold 4 releases, so it's split
[15:10] <smartboyhw> Which textfile in kubuntu-automation am I supposed to use for getting package names?
[15:10] <tester56> Riddell, self compiling should still work, right?
[15:10] <tester56> Riddell, (appmenu-gtk)
[15:10] <smartboyhw> Damn..
[15:10] <smartboyhw> Anyways, it doesn't affect the build...
[15:10] <smartboyhw> calligra (1:2.7.1-0ubuntu1~ubuntu13.04~ppa2) raring; urgency=low
[15:10] <smartboyhw>   * Backport to quantal.
[15:10] <smartboyhw>   * Drop vc-dev as build-dep since it does not exist in raring.
[15:11] <yofel> the script should choose the right one by itself
[15:11] <smartboyhw> Uh hum.. Quantal
[15:11] <smartboyhw> yofel, I need to run ./kdesc-package-names right?
[15:11] <yofel> oh right, rohan lost his quantal changes, so you'll have to create the file first
[15:11] <yofel> no
[15:11] <smartboyhw> yofel, no?
[15:11] <yofel> take the current list for saucy and check if something needs to be removed (pykde at least)
[15:12] <smartboyhw> yofel, I would rather take the list from precise:P
[15:12] <yofel> well, you *could* run kdesc-package-names, but that'll just give you the list for saucy
[15:12] <yofel> well, or do that, yeah
[15:13] <yofel> and don't forget to use -T unstable, or you'll use the wrong set of hooks
[15:14] <Riddell> wow
[15:14] <Riddell> 7 donations :)
[15:15] <Riddell> almost at £100, drinks are on the Kubuntu Council!
[15:15] <smartboyhw> yofel, um no need for --sru right?
[15:16] <smartboyhw> ./kubuntu-initial-upload -d quantal -v 4.10.97 -m "quantal backport" -y 12.10 -T unstable -t ~/kde/temp
[15:16] <smartboyhw> is that correct?
[15:16] <smartboyhw> Riddell, that's a lot
[15:17] <yofel> wrong script
[15:17] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh?
[15:17] <smartboyhw> batch-backport?
[15:17] <yofel> ./kubuntu-batch-backport -v 4.10.97 -f saucy -t quantal -V 12.10 -T unstable -u medium
[15:18] <yofel> then again, leave -u away
[15:18] <smartboyhw> yofel, so don't use -u you mean?
[15:19] <yofel> yeah, not important enough
[15:36] <BluesKaj> ok, if anyone on Kubuntu 13.10 has lsb-core and ia32-libs installed then trying to upgrade or dist-upgrade today may create a dependency hell loop. Especially if you had google-earth installed which was taken out by yesterday's upgrade 
[15:37] <BluesKaj> or not  , iit also affects those without the google earth depends as well
[15:39] <BluesKaj> I cross posted this in #ubuntu+1
[15:40] <BluesKaj> it's an issue with libgphoto2-2 
[15:41] <smartboyhw> What's the issue?
[15:42] <BluesKaj> http://pastie.org/private/g8wndrs2y2peq6omq5jilg , smartboyhw 
[15:43] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, OK, what happened is that libgphoto2-2 is clearly NOT supposed to have Multi-Arch
[15:44] <BluesKaj> well I have other stuff to do , so i'll have to leave it for now, smartboyhw 
[15:45] <BluesKaj> smartboyhw, check with chjunior over at #ubuntu+1, he p[osted that url , originally
[15:45] <BluesKaj> gotta go
[15:46] <BluesKaj> he's on ubuntu btw
[21:05] <volkan_> hi all. can someone add Turkish Kubuntu mirror into download page? ftp://ftp.linux.org.tr/kubuntu/
[21:52] <volkan_> Riddell: hi Jonathan. who is responsible for download page?
[21:58] <valorie> volkan_: it's really late in the UK where Riddell is -- maybe drop an email to kubuntu-devel list?
[22:00] <volkan_> valorie: thanks valorie. i will send an e-mail than
