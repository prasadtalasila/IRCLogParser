[12:34] <coz_> BluesKaj:   Side Band Adressing
[12:35] <BluesKaj> coz_, which nvidia driver ?
[12:36] <coz_> BluesKaj:  this is an old  agp slot card,, was easy to enable these prior to 12.04 but noticed yesterday I cannot enable the "method" i used to use
[12:38] <BluesKaj> does the nvidia-current driver run it ?

[12:40] <BluesKaj> coz_,^
[12:43] <coz_> BluesKaj:   sorry cant find link but this:   Sideband Addressing is an AGP feature which allows additional channels to transmit data between the video card and the rest of the system.

[16:02] <GiGaHuRtZ> Well, I asked in #kde about 15min ago and got no answers (oir even speaking) so I guess I will ask here
[16:03] <GiGaHuRtZ> Any suggestions on a program that can search for dupe MP3 files in folders, and delete the things? Preferably GUI, I gounf one, but I donno it doesnt seem to work right or something
[16:03] <GiGaHuRtZ> Preferably a QT one, but it doesn't have to be if it does what I need it to
[16:04] <GiGaHuRtZ> I found one, called dupeguru, and they have version for all sorts of things, music, pictures etc. I tried out the dupeguru_me (music edition) and it seemed to find all my dupes and stuff, and I asked it to delete, but I donno, didnt seem to work
[16:04] <GiGaHuRtZ> I think I may have been doing something wrong, not sure

[17:33] <draikx> Hello. I did a kernel upgrade yesterday and upon rebooting, my display is offset by about an inch to the right. I am using my TV with 1920x1080 resolution, and VGA port. Using 'xvidtune' does not help, as it reports any and all changes as "invalid".
[17:34] <draikx> I've also been looking online, but I don't have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file for my 13.04 installation.
[17:34] <draikx> If it matters, this is for my Asus nettop box (EB1501)
[17:47] <kdef> kubuntu keeps changing the time displayed to UTC
[17:47] <kdef> kubuntu sucks
[17:52] <genii> kdef: Have you set a timezone?
[17:52] <genii> !xorgconf draikx
[17:53] <genii> !xorgconf | draikx
[17:53] <ubottu> draikx: The /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is deprecated, but sometimes may still be needed to pass values to specific drivers. Generic xorg.conf generation: http://ubottu.com/y/xorgconf - ATI/AMD ( fglrx driver ) specific: http://ubottu.com/y/atiamd - NVidia ( nvidia driver )specific: http://ubottu.com/y/nvidia man xorg.conf for file structure and syntax.
[17:53] <draikx> This issue seems to only appear with 1920x1080 resolution. I just went down to 1280x1024 and I don't have the offset issue.
[17:55] <draikx> Thank you, genii. I'll give that a try.
[18:21] <kdef> genii:  I've fixed it before but it's back to UTC time

[23:06] <alfonsojon> Hi, how can I make my task manager iconified?
[23:06] <alfonsojon> As in remove the text and keep it icon-only
[23:07] <alfonsojon> I have so many windows open at the same time, but I really don't like grouping
[23:08] <bootkiller> use icon-tasks
[23:09] <bootkiller> and remove the default one
[23:12] <alfonsojon> thanks
[23:12] <alfonsojon> :D
[23:14] <alfonsojon> Is there a way to make icon-tasks "bigger" though?
[23:14] <alfonsojon> As in add padding to the icons
[23:14] <alfonsojon> it seems squashed.
[23:15] <bootkiller> increase spacing in the options
[23:15] <bootkiller> the icons also stretch to the height of the panel

[23:16] <GiGaHuRtZ> I got a problem im not sure how to fix now.  By mistake I removed some core packages of KDE when removing something using a wildcard (*), stupid I know, but I caught it as it was trying to remove like 100 things
[23:17] <GiGaHuRtZ> It removed like 4 things, not sure exactly what they are, because my first instinct was to close the term
[23:18] <GiGaHuRtZ> So then I did a dpkg --congiure -a, then went ahead and tried doing an upgrade, it doesnt want to upgrade anything, but a TON of packages are marked as autoremovable now
[23:18] <GiGaHuRtZ> whats weird is the thing I was removing with a wildcard was just wine*
[23:20] <wxl> GiGaHuRtZ: did you try looking at /var/log/apt/history.log and see what happened?
[23:20] <GiGaHuRtZ> thanks, i was trying to thing of what log it was
[23:21] <GiGaHuRtZ> And now i also learned a good lesson setting tricky aliases
[23:21] <wxl> :)
[23:21] <GiGaHuRtZ> I have apt-get aliases to always answer yes
[23:21] <GiGaHuRtZ> :P
[23:22] <GiGaHuRtZ> wtf, this was the command, apt-get --yes remove wine*
[23:22] <wxl> it should say under that what was actually done
[23:22] <GiGaHuRtZ> it tried to remove, fluxgui:amd64 (1.1.8), partitionmanager:amd64 (1.0.3-0ubuntu6), kubuntu-debug-installer:amd64 (13.04ubuntu3), k3b-i18n:amd64 (2.0.2-6ubuntu1), kpat:amd64 (4.10.95-0ubuntu$
[23:22] <GiGaHuRtZ> and more
[23:22] <GiGaHuRtZ> that makes no sense
[23:22] <wxl> apt wild cards can be inexplicable sometimes
[23:23] <GiGaHuRtZ> ya...
[23:23] <GiGaHuRtZ> it was the --yes alioas that hurt me
[23:23] <wxl> i'm sure it all makes sense somehow but…
[23:23] <GiGaHuRtZ> ya
[23:24] <GiGaHuRtZ> And I must have some that wants policykit-1-gnome (i forget what it may be), but that was to be installed on the same operation
[23:24] <GiGaHuRtZ> and since then it hasnt been, weird
[23:25] <GiGaHuRtZ> wxl: maybe you can help me
[23:25] <wxl> ?
[23:25] <GiGaHuRtZ> I have the HUGE list of packages, but is there some way to figure out what ones /actually/ got removed?
[23:25] <GiGaHuRtZ> I mean, the list is so but kate wraps it
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> it kills like line length ;limit of 4096 char, lol
[23:26] <wxl> um
[23:26] <wxl> use vim? :)
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> it wouldnt matter, thats not the issue
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> the issue is, how do I know what like 4 of these things were removede
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> one sec, ill paste so you can see
[23:26] <wxl> well if they all say they were removed they probably were
[23:26] <wxl> might be depends
[23:27] <GiGaHuRtZ> pretty positive they werentr
[23:27] <GiGaHuRtZ> I killed the process, etc
[23:27] <wxl> i.e. your wildcard resulted in 4 removals but they had a bunch of depends each so it actually resulted in a lot more
[23:27] <GiGaHuRtZ> no no
[23:27] <GiGaHuRtZ> im saying I caught it, after it removed the 4th thing
[23:27] <wxl> oh!
[23:28] <wxl> 1s
[23:28] <GiGaHuRtZ> just look at my paste though one sec
[23:28] <GiGaHuRtZ> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5938106/
[23:28] <wxl> /var/log/apt/term.log is the raw output
[23:28] <GiGaHuRtZ> heh ubuntu paste garbled it worse than everything else, (vi, kate etc)
[23:29] <GiGaHuRtZ> ok thanks
[23:29] <wxl> /var/log/dpkg.log can be helpful too
[23:29] <GiGaHuRtZ> that shows the 4 pkgs
[23:30] <GiGaHuRtZ> Removing akonadi-facebook ...Removing kde-config-pimactivity ...Removing libpimactivity4 ...Removing korganizer ...
[23:31] <valorie> GiGaHuRtZ: how about sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop ?
[23:31] <valorie> that should pull in everything necessary
[23:31] <GiGaHuRtZ> i will try it if giving these 4 back doesnt
[23:31] <GiGaHuRtZ> but kubuntu-desktop was not removed
[23:31] <GiGaHuRtZ> and its not like my system is just stock, its FAR from it
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> oh phew
[23:32] <valorie> that's a meta-package
[23:32] <valorie> so no, it wouldn't have been removed
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> adding those 4 back got rid of those 100+ autoremovals
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> valorie: i know it is
[23:32] <valorie> cool
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> but it gets autoremoved when you remove other things sometimes
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> ive done it :P
[23:33] <GiGaHuRtZ> now to adjust my aliases :)
[23:34] <wxl> i'm sure you have rm aliased to rm -rf, too, right? XD
[23:34] <GiGaHuRtZ> no lol
[23:34] <GiGaHuRtZ> I have a seperate cmd for that
[23:34] <GiGaHuRtZ> rmrf
[23:34] <GiGaHuRtZ> ;)
[23:34] <wxl> hehe
[23:34] <GiGaHuRtZ> and srm, sudo rm
[23:34] <FloodBotK1> GiGaHuRtZ: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[23:34]  * wxl slaps FloodBotK1 
[23:34] <GiGaHuRtZ> heh
[23:35] <GiGaHuRtZ> wxl: if i remember correctly, in redhat the rm command always asks for confirmation
[23:35] <GiGaHuRtZ> or at least is used to back in the day
[23:35] <wxl> don't ask me. i haven't used hat-based distros in aeons
[23:36] <GiGaHuRtZ> Same, but I remember that when reading the RHCE course stuff
[23:36] <GiGaHuRtZ> Which probably makes sense for a server in some settings
[23:36] <wxl> oh i didn't know sysadmins made mistakes
[23:36] <wxl> :)
[23:36] <GiGaHuRtZ> haha
[23:40] <alfonsojon> Well, yeah
[23:40] <alfonsojon> I can make my panel bigger
[23:40] <alfonsojon> But to get the icon size I want, my panel will be about 50-60 pixels high.
[23:40] <alfonsojon> I just want something that's along the lines of Windows 7
[23:40] <alfonsojon> xD
[23:41] <GiGaHuRtZ> alfonsojon: what kubuntu version?
[23:41] <valorie> perhaps you'd rather have a full-screen type launcher?
[23:41] <valorie> homerun is the new one, as I recall
[23:41] <alfonsojon> I have Kubuntu 13.04
[23:41] <alfonsojon> And I tried search and launch
[23:41] <alfonsojon> And homerun
[23:41] <alfonsojon> They were alright but I prefer a traditional desktop
[23:41] <GiGaHuRtZ> I know they changed something to do with the panel launchers and such and the sizing in one of the newer kde releases
[23:42] <GiGaHuRtZ> not sure if it applies
[23:42] <alfonsojon> My goal is to make a Windows 7-like setup for users who want to switch from Windows 7 to Kubuntu easily
[23:42] <valorie> nice idea, GiGaHuRtZ
[23:42] <GiGaHuRtZ> http://blogs.kde.org/2013/07/29/kde-plasma-desktop-411s-new-task-manager
[23:43] <GiGaHuRtZ> im using 4.11RC or whatever you'd like to call it, but i havent played with what they are talking about in that blog post
[23:46] <GiGaHuRtZ> Anyone using this by chance? https://launchpad.net/~blue-shell/+archive/samba-mounter
[23:46] <GiGaHuRtZ> Just curious if its GUI based
[23:47] <alfonsojon> Is there a way to add KDE 4.11 RC2 to my Kubuntu 13.04 system?
[23:47] <alfonsojon> I used Kubuntu 13.10 alpha and it was amazing
[23:47] <GiGaHuRtZ> ya
[23:47] <GiGaHuRtZ> look into the kde ppas
[23:47] <alfonsojon> But kdialog lagged terribly and I had to wait about 30 seconds to a minute waiting for the "Save As" dialog to open
[23:47] <GiGaHuRtZ> https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa
[23:47] <GiGaHuRtZ> obviously do not use the staging one, lol
[23:50] <GiGaHuRtZ> I wish they changed the way apt interfaces with launchpad ppas, so for instance, if you have 10 ppas enabled, when you go to update apt-get, it just pulls from launchpad once for all those ppas, rather than sending a different request over and over and over
[23:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> That would be a neat feature imho
[23:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> I have 14 pull ppas, and it results in over 40 requests
[23:53] <alfonsojon> Raring only has 4.10
[23:53] <alfonsojon> I know I can use the saucy ppa
[23:53] <alfonsojon> But I'm just uncomfortable about mixing them.
[23:55] <bootkiller> alfonsojon, use project neon http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Using_Project_Neon_to_contribute_to_KDE
[23:55] <alfonsojon> Ah
[23:55] <alfonsojon> So it's the Plasma workspace, but as a differing fork as to not modify KDE 4.10
[23:55] <alfonsojon> Kind of like Chrome Canary, right?
[23:57] <GiGaHuRtZ> weird, I added that ppa for homerun just to try it, and I can see one of the pother packages in the ppa, but not homerun
[23:58] <bootkiller> alfonsojon, If I remember correctly it's separated development kde build for kubuntu and it doesn't affect your current kde install, you need to change to it in the login manager.
[23:58] <GiGaHuRtZ> alfonsojon: it wont affect your stable kde install
[23:58] <alfonsojon> Alrighty then
[23:58] <GiGaHuRtZ> it says so right on the page
[23:58] <GiGaHuRtZ> im not getting this homerun thing though
[23:59] <GiGaHuRtZ> oh, maybe thats not the actual name of the package as shown in the ppa
