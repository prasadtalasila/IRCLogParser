[00:08] <ESphynx> Could this be turned on by default if running on nVidia hardware or something?
[00:09] <RAOF> Maybe.
[00:09] <RAOF> It's probably a performance drain, though.
[00:13] <ESphynx> RAOF: I'd rather have my text editor working at 60 frames a second than being unusable at 120 frames / second
[00:14] <RAOF> Yeah, but this doesn't apply to just your text editor :/
[00:14] <ESphynx> RAOF: It applies to all programs I run on this sytem.
[00:15] <ESphynx> i.e. on all systems using nVidia drivers, which is probably at least half of what I consider a usable machine
[00:15] <ESphynx> I'm all for a proper fix, but until then this ought to be enabled.

[02:52] <ESphynx> after the last dist-upgrade, I can't login with Gnome Flashback (No effects) anymore :S all black
[02:53] <ESphynx> or if installing ccsm could do that :S (Saucy)
[02:54] <jbicha> ESphynx: I believe that's bug 1217991
[02:54] <ubottu> bug 1217991 in upstart (Ubuntu) "Regression: gnome-flashback* fails to init with latest upstart" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1217991
[02:55] <ESphynx> thanks jbicha...
[02:55] <ESphynx> and what I thought was a workaround isn't working half the time for my update bug
[02:58] <ESphynx> So the only DE that actually was usable for me is now b0rked.
[03:00] <jbicha> ESphynx: the bug description has an easy workaround but the bug will be fixed soon
[03:00] <ESphynx> jbicha: k. thanks. I really wish this Compiz bug was fixed though :S
[03:01] <ESphynx> then I could try to figure out what's up with my other resizing/maximizing bug in Unity :P
[03:02] <stgraber> jbicha: the fix is wrong, those session names don't exist
[03:03] <stgraber> jbicha: so I'll need to actually figure out what's wrong with flashback running under upstart before I can get it fixed. I'll try to take a look tomorrow.
[03:04] <ESphynx> stgraber: The fix works for me.
[03:04] <ESphynx> renaming the 2 to -flashback rather than -fallback
[03:06] <stgraber> ESphynx: sure it does, it's just not a fix
[03:06] <stgraber> ESphynx: renaming the entries is the exact same as removing them
[03:06] <stgraber> which means, disabling the feature
[03:07] <stgraber> what we want is for the feature to be enabled and working and for that upstart-xsession is perfectly correct, it's just something else down the line that's failing and needs debugging and fixing
[03:07] <jbicha> stgraber: thanks
[03:07] <ESphynx> But Gnome fallback is what seems to start for me?
[03:08] <stgraber> sure, just not under upstart
[03:08] <ESphynx> ah ok
[03:09] <stgraber> jbicha: I know it used to work but I probably tested this before the whole flashback rename. It looks like something is confused by the names not being consistent, but it's not obvious what since it's not hardcoded in any of the places I'd have expected. Anyway, should take me a few minutes to figure out and fix once I reproduce the problem here (won't do that just now but will do it first thing tomorrow).

[10:43] <zyga> hi
[10:44] <zyga> current daily ubiquity installer seems broken, at least two things that I can see are affected: networking configs don't work (policykit rejects control attempts) and the top panel is sized incorrectly, being approximately 10x larger
[10:45] <xnox> zyga: both of which are filed bugs on ubiquity. The top panel is caused/assigned by/to larsu. The other one, missing proper logind integration
[10:45] <xnox> zyga: but maybe policykit policy also need changing.
[10:46] <rbasak> Is there a magic way to do a no change rebuild for a package that has no Ubuntu delta? Or do I need to do it manually, and then make sure to resync tha package manually again at some future date?
[10:46] <cjwatson> dch -R
[10:46] <cjwatson> That'll append build1 which doesn't inhibit autosyncs
=== Sweetsha1k is now known as Sweetshark
[10:47] <rbasak> Ah, so the version number is special? I understand now. Thanks!
[10:47] <cjwatson> Yes.  The thing that inhibits autosync is the presence of the "ubuntu" substring in the version.
[10:48] <zyga> xnox: cool, so I won't go hunting or reporting them, thanks
[10:50] <ekarlso-> do I need to have my secret key on the machine I use for signing packages ?
[10:50] <cjwatson> Yes.
[10:51] <cjwatson> If you like, you can do the signing on a machine other than the one where you build the package, using either "debsign -r" or "debrsign" depending on the direction (see their manual pages).
[10:51] <rbasak> I use debsign -r to avoid this. But I must trust the machine I'm using, since I guess it could trojan some other thing to sign.

[12:04] <nemo> so. there's this script that was causing a rather misleading motd... /usr/lib/update-notifier/update-motd-fsck-at-reboot
[12:05] <nemo> reason it is misleading is it appears that if the last check was <1h ago, it won't even check the filesystem values
[12:05] <nemo> so I rebooted several times, thinking there was an issue

[12:08] <nemo> well, I'd say the clear prob is if [ $(($stampt + 3600)) -lt $now ] || [ $stampt -gt $now ]; then
[12:08] <nemo> where stampt is stat -c %Y of the scary message
[12:14] <nemo> jrib: admittedly I don't know of a "nice" way to get the boot time...
[12:14] <nemo> apart from
[12:14] <nemo> date +%s -d "$(last | head -n 1 | awk '{print $5,$6,$7,$8}')"
[12:14] <nemo> which I just stitched together and seems pretty ugly
[12:14] <nemo> you'd thing it would be in sysctl or something...
[12:14] <nemo> I have no idea if that is even a locale specific format :-/
[12:15] <nemo> (the date string)
[12:15] <nemo> but anyway, assuming oh,  boott=$(date +%s -d "$(last | head -n 1 | awk '{print $5,$6,$7,$8}')")
[12:16] <nemo> then they should recheck if $boott gt $stamptt
[12:16] <nemo> ah well. whatev
[12:17] <nemo> hm. that's not even a nice use of last
[12:17] <nemo> I need a grep for reboot in there, and a skip of generation if it isn't.
[12:17] <nemo> something in sysctl would definitely be nicer. or maybe if ubuntu just wrote boot time to a file that its own script could check :)

[17:59] <xnox> jdstrand: Laney has a codesearch instance running in canonistack =) not sure how fully operational it is.
[18:00] <jdstrand> oh, that would be nice to poke at
[18:01] <sarnold> oh man, that'd be nice. I love debian's codesearch

[18:21] <sarnold> seb128: retracers seem dead again -- any chance of asking IS to monitor the cranky things to auto-restart when they wedge? :)
[18:26]  * dholbach hugs cyphermox
[18:26] <cyphermox> dholbach: hey, just trying to read the list is painful, so many pings about other stuff :)
[18:26] <dholbach> I know
[18:27] <dholbach> I did quite some sponsoring in the last days to get stuff in before feature freeze
[18:27] <dholbach> but during UDS it's a bit crazy admittedly
[18:27] <dholbach> I'll do the rest of my session tomorrow
[18:30] <pkern> xnox: Before I do that I set up a private instance of codesearch. -_-
[18:33] <pkern> jdstrand: How large is it?
[18:36] <jdstrand> pkern: I don't have a private instance of codesearch. I use debmirror to mirror all of lucid-saucy for amd64 and i386
[18:36] <pkern> jdstrand: I mean the unpacked tree.
[18:37] <jdstrand> pkern: I use scripts to unpack on the fly and then delete after the package is searched
[18:37] <jdstrand> pkern: so I don't unpack all the sources
[18:38] <jdstrand> (at the same time)
[18:38] <seb128> sarnold, talk to slangasek, he sort of suggested he was wanting to help keeping those running ;-)
[18:39] <slangasek> hnngh
[18:39] <slangasek> and no email notification of it hanging, eh
[18:39] <sarnold> slangasek: hello :) about those retracers...
[18:39] <slangasek> seb128: I also always forget what machine it's running on, remind me?
[18:39] <seb128> slangasek, porter-i386.c.c
[18:39] <seb128> I removed the lock
[18:40] <seb128> but I think it's hitting a bug it doesn't like
[18:40] <seb128> bug #1216901
[18:40] <ubottu> bug 1216901 in linkchecker (Ubuntu) "linkchecker-gui crashes on startup" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1216901
[18:40] <slangasek> ok
[18:40] <seb128> the bt isn't very useful though :/
[18:41] <seb128> slangasek, do you want to have a look to the issue or should I just untag the bug so the retracer doesn't keep banging on it?
[18:41] <seb128> well, I guess we can untag & have a look as well
[18:41] <slangasek> seb128: I won't have time to look at it very quickly, so please untag it for now anyway
[18:41] <bdmurray> barry: the tracebacks in https://errors.ubuntu.com/problem/15bc0ab1791f275923e1d66575637a22e2b24b7d look suspcious to me - as in I wonder about the systems

[18:49] <barry> bdmurray: that looks very suspicious.  it looks typical for a 3rd party extension module not checking a set exception somewhere

[19:10] <lool> stgraber: ok
[19:14] <ekarlso-> "Source/binary (i.e. mixed) uploads are not allowed." how can I get dput to only select the source ?!
[19:15] <shadeslayer> ekarlso-: just run debuild -S -sa on the source
[19:16] <shadeslayer> or -sd if you just want to upload a package which already has the tar on launchpad
[19:16] <cjwatson> -sd is basically never necessary
[19:16] <cjwatson> but yeah, -S is the key bit
[19:17] <shadeslayer> cjwatson: oh, so -sa uploads the tar but launchpad is clever enough to not make a copy?
[19:17] <cjwatson> you can upload a duplicate orig.tar as long as it's identical
[19:17] <ekarlso-> I used the dpkg-buildpackage binary
[19:17] <cjwatson> I usually use debuild -S and only use -sa if needed
[19:18] <ekarlso-> is that the same thing
[19:18] <shadeslayer> cjwatson: aha I see
[19:18] <cjwatson> ekarlso-: Launchpad doesn't accept binary uploads, they have to be source-only.  No it isn't the same
[19:18] <cjwatson> You can use dpkg-buildpackage -S, though debuild -S is usually easier
[19:18] <cjwatson> (it's a slightly smarter wrapper)
[19:18] <ekarlso-> how can I have it not try to sign it ?
[19:18] <cjwatson> -uc -us
[19:18] <cjwatson> or just ignore the signing failures
[19:19] <cjwatson> you still have to sign it before uploading to LP of course
[19:19] <shadeslayer> ^^
[19:19] <ekarlso-> debuild -S -uc -us the ?
[19:19] <cjwatson> yeah
[19:19] <ekarlso-> what's Standards-Version ?
[19:20] <ekarlso-> my build fails on that now :p
[19:20] <cjwatson> see the Debian policy manual
[19:20] <cjwatson> http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/
[19:20] <cjwatson> specifically http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Standards-Version
[19:20] <cjwatson> and http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#s-standardsversion
[19:20] <cjwatson> (the latter's a better reference, sorry)
[19:21] <ekarlso-> should it fail on 3.9.3 ?
[19:22] <cjwatson> 3.9.3 is fine
[19:23] <ekarlso-> mine fails telling me it is outdated..
[19:23] <cjwatson> that's not a failure
[19:23] <cjwatson> it's quite important to distinguish errors from warnings or informational messages ...
[19:23] <cjwatson> the current version is 3.9.4 but you should check the policy manual's upgrading checklist before blindly changing the number
[19:24] <cjwatson> the point is to remind people to check changes in policy
[19:24] <ekarlso-> cjwatson: how come ? ;)
[19:24] <cjwatson> because that's the point of standards-version - it's the latest version of the policy manual you've checked your package against
[19:24] <cjwatson> it isn't supposed to be a paperwork exercise in updating the number :)
[19:25] <cjwatson> if it's a little out of date, so be it, it's not a failure
[19:58] <stgraber> lool, barry: I'll invite the two of you to an hangout in the next 5min

[22:03] <ekarlso-> it works when building locally
