[01:10] <manchicken> Okay, I'm stumped... virtualbox won't mount my shares.
[01:11] <manchicken> I've installed the add-ons in the guest, and it hangs when I try to `ls` in the folder on which I've mounted the share, but that's it.
[01:11] <manchicken> I'm trying to use virtualbox to test the debug installer changes I made, but it's just not working.
[02:03] <manchicken> Tonio: Hiya
[06:52] <soee> good morning
[08:14] <lordievader> Good morning.
[09:06] <apachelogger> Riddell: ping
[09:40] <apachelogger> Riddell: fr, es: 100%; de: 71% (presumably 'unkown' strings that shouldn't show anyway); it, ru, anything asian: 0%
[09:40] <apachelogger> not the best of translation stats
[09:42] <Quintasan> \o
[10:09] <apachelogger> Riddell: 1.0.0 uploaded
[10:09] <apachelogger> also created a new card to do with integration, which I conveniently forgot to add to the previous card (adding to seed and stuff)
[10:13] <apachelogger> upstream release procedure done as well
[10:14]  * smartboyhw packages it for apachelogger ?
[10:14] <apachelogger> it be packaged
[10:14] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, it is packaged already?
[10:14] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: you should write "enhanced foreign language ISO test cases"
[10:14] <apachelogger> not package stuff
[10:14] <apachelogger> due Aug 20
[10:15] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, the problem is I have no time now suddenly for long projects
[10:15] <apachelogger> that aint no long project :P
[10:15]  * smartboyhw gives up the card
[10:15] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, it takes 5 days to write one
[10:15] <apachelogger> :O
[10:15] <apachelogger> dafuq
[10:15] <apachelogger> anyway
[10:15] <smartboyhw> And I don't have the bandwidth to download an ISO now
[10:15] <smartboyhw> Suddenly my Wifi is very slow
[10:16] <apachelogger> Riddell: seeing as we have no other cards due for feature freeze I'll do phonon drawings again
[10:16] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: don't think you need to download a new iso to write the test case any old iso will do ;)
[10:16] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, we HAVE to
[10:17] <smartboyhw> That's Testcase writing Code of Conduct:P
[10:17] <apachelogger> what do I care
[10:17] <apachelogger> bad test case > no test case
[10:17] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, yourself:P
[10:17] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, sorry, I rather want to have no test case > bad test case
[10:17] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, do you want me to fetch somebody from the QA team to write one?
[10:18] <apachelogger> sure, I just want a test case :P
[10:18] <apachelogger> how it gets done is beyond my level of interest :P
[10:18] <apachelogger> anyway, lunch and then architecture drawing session \o/
[10:19] <smartboyhw> kubotu: newversion about-distro 1.0.0
[10:19] <kubotu> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1218281
[10:26] <smartboyhw> Riddell, shadeslayer apachelogger yofel https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/packaging-staging-1/+files/about-distro_1.0.0-0ubuntu1.dsc
[10:26] <smartboyhw> I will come back after shower to see if I can do the foreign language testcase
[10:26]  * smartboyhw has rotten skills on that
[11:01]  * apachelogger sighs at launchpad
[11:02] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, why?
[11:03] <apachelogger> time out of the time out after a time out
[11:03] <smartboyhw> lol
[11:22] <Riddell> apachelogger: phonon drawings?
[11:23] <apachelogger> architecture sanity review, something is astray with class interdependence
[11:27] <Riddell> most poeticly put, is that a quote from shakespear?
[11:29] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I know you are Scottish, but you should at least be able to spell Shakespeare correctly...
[11:34] <Riddell> :)
[11:34] <Riddell> history is on my side, he couldn't even spell his own name correctly :)
[11:41] <smartboyhw> Riddell, uh OK
[12:03] <Riddell> smartboyhw: did you update the about-distro package?
[12:03] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yep
[12:08] <Riddell> lovely
[12:08] <smartboyhw> Riddell, not sure if apachelogger uploaded it yet though
[12:08] <Riddell> yeah it's in
[12:22] <apachelogger> Riddell: yes, shaekspear that was :P
[12:22] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: I uploaded it before I even wrote anything about it :P
[12:23] <apachelogger> which is what the message "<apachelogger> Riddell: 1.0.0 uploaded" was supposed to communicate :P
[12:23] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, huh
[12:24] <Riddell> apachelogger: ooh :)
[12:36] <Riddell> smartboyhw: putting on your press hat are you? :) http://dot.kde.org/2013/08/29/kde-releases-going-through-changes
[12:37] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yes, my first article to dot (NOT YET FINISHED)
[12:37] <smartboyhw> We need pics still
[12:37] <smartboyhw> Which unfortunately, I can't provide
[12:53] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[14:40] <kubotu> ::workspace-bugs:: [1180470] "Window title" text box disabled in Window-Specific Settings @ https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1180470 (by Ibrahim M. Ghazal)
[15:17] <smartboyhw> YEAH! My Season of KDE project got accepted!
[15:26] <Riddell> smartboyhw: what is it?
[15:26] <smartboyhw> Riddell, write documentation for Muon and Muon Discover
[15:26] <smartboyhw> So, Kubuntu benefits a lot;)
[15:26] <Riddell> lovely :)
[15:27] <smartboyhw> Riddell, more even, mentor is jtechidna 
[15:27] <smartboyhw> Easy to communicate, that is
[15:28] <Riddell> "coreymon77 (coreymon77) renewed their own membership in the Kubuntu Members (kubuntu-members)" yay coreymon77 still loves us
[15:28] <Riddell> although I'm not sure I remember who coreymon77 actually is
[15:29] <smartboyhw> Riddell, huh
[15:29] <smartboyhw> Riddell, when did his membership start?
[15:29] <Riddell> dunno I just got it in e-mail
[15:30] <smartboyhw> -.-
[15:30] <smartboyhw> Riddell, weird, most SoK projects are really coding ones
[15:31] <Riddell> yeah most summer of code projects are coding ones
[15:31] <Riddell> SoK will follow that
[15:31] <smartboyhw> Riddell, well, GSoC is expected to be code
[15:31] <smartboyhw> But not SoK:P
[15:32] <Riddell> right,  no reason why it can't be anything else
[15:32] <smartboyhw> They actually wanted more non-code projects
=== jtechidna is now known as JontheEchidna
[16:35] <mparillo> Adding comments to Launchpad Bug reports crashes Rekonq on 13.10. Any suggestions on whether to file a bug against Rekonq or against Launchpad?
[16:37] <Riddell> mparillo: probably against webkit
[16:37] <Riddell> mparillo: try using the qtwebkit-source in saucy-proposed
[16:37] <Riddell> then get a backtrace and send it upstream
[16:38] <mparillo> Riddell: Thank you. Will try tonight.
[16:39] <BluesKaj> mparillo, heh , another drop in the rekonq bug bucket
[16:43] <mparillo> BluesKaj: It matters to me because I like a live USB without persistence for much of my day. Otherwise, I could simply install a different browser for known problem sites (owa, allthingsd.com and now Launchpad)
[16:50] <BluesKaj> mparillo, ok , but whynot a VB/kubuntu install?
[17:26] <soee> Riddell, you asked once about Network Manager ?
