[00:11] <tertu> Hello!
[00:11] <doctor_> Tertu Hello!
[00:11] <doctor_> I was wondering if there was a way to make an irc server/network myself...
[00:11] <jalcine> doctor_ who?
[00:11] <doctor_> jalcine yes.
[00:12] <jalcine> lol
[00:12] <jalcine> ;)
[00:12] <doctor_> ;(
[00:12] <mparillo> Watcher|2: Have you tried System Settings > Desktop Effects?
[00:12] <doctor_> well? can i make my own irc network?
[00:12] <tertu> if you mean host one yourself there are plenty of programs to that effect, if you mean write one yourself i've heard IRC is one of the simplest protocols there is.
[00:12] <Watcher|2> Yes, I have. Didn't have any effect.
[00:13] <doctor_> The former. Tertu what do you perfer?
[00:13] <doctor_> or suggest?
[00:14] <tertu> I don't run an IRC server, so I don't really have an opinion there and I guess I can't help you past saying "there are IRC servers", sorry
[00:14] <doctor_> tertu; Ah, i see (said the blind man to his deaf cat)
[00:15] <tertu> i have to leave anyway as i'm testing some configuration stuff
[00:24] <doctor> Anyone stillhere?
[00:24] <doctor> Hello!?!?!?
=== doctor is now known as Guest48510
[00:24] <Guest48510> oh no!
[00:25] <Guest48510> how do i know what my password is?
[00:25] <Guest48510> i didn't set one for irc...
[00:29] <melanie> i have just installed kubuntu 12.04 on a dell vostro 1000 for a friend. unfortunately, audio does not seem to be working. would anyone here be able to assist with this?
[00:36] <Avihay> melanie: use lspci to find out what the audio card model is, then try to google issues on that
[00:37] <Avihay> also kmix had issues, you might want to try using pavcontrol to adjust the volume at first
[00:38] <melanie> Avihay: i have already done both, but so far to no avail
[00:38] <sithlord48> melanie:  aslamixer 
[00:39] <melanie> yes, i've also messed with alsamixer many times
[00:39] <sithlord48> melanie:  or system settings->multimedia-> audio settings -> audio device settings  check the different devices and try the speakers.
[00:40] <melanie> sithlord48: unfortunately, i've done that, too
[00:40] <sithlord48> sorry thats last part should be audio and video settings -> audio hardware setup
[00:42] <melanie> yea... i have tried all of that many times, sad to say
[00:45] <sithlord48> melanie:  is the sound muted ? (or apper to be) 
[00:46] <melanie> sithlord48: it acts like sound is muted, but i is not muted in any settings
[00:46] <sithlord48> melanie:  also is the hdmi audio?
[00:47] <melanie> there should be no hdmi audio on this machine... this laptop is 6+ years old
[00:48] <sithlord48> melanie:  if possible try the headphone port to see if the names are mixed up .. you may also want to try the veromix widget instead of kmix since its designed to work w/ pulseaudio.
[00:49] <melanie> ok, i am not familiar with veromix.... i was using pavucontrol, however
[00:52] <melanie> it acts like the sound card is recognized, and pavucontrol indicates that audio is being produced, but there is no sound'
[00:52] <melanie> audio under linux sure has not gotten less complex over the years
[00:54] <melanie> is it still possible to just simply remove pulseaudio in kubuntu?
[00:54] <sithlord48> idk have not tried in some time since here its working. 
[00:55] <sithlord48> melanie:  is it outputing to the headphones ? perhaps the lables are backward in the mixer 
[00:55] <melanie> yea, it has worked pretty well for me the past 2 years or so, too
[00:55] <melanie> sithlord48: i have tried using the headphone jack, but the results are the same
[00:56] <sithlord48> melanie:  what about the other sound ports for in and mic? 
[00:57] <melanie> sithlord48: i did try plugging speakers into both the mic and heaphones jack, but there was no sound in either case... i have not tried to use a microphone

[08:14] <lordievader> Good morning.
[08:51] <Amanfire> hi
[08:52] <Amanfire> why is the 32 bit version recommended? 
[08:52] <lordievader> Hey Amanfire 
[08:52] <lordievader> Amanfire: Is it?
[08:52] <Amanfire> http://www.kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/download says so
[08:52] <lordievader> Depends on the hardware I'd say.
[08:52] <Amanfire> hardware here, under windows, fully supports 64 bit
[08:53] <Unit193> There's more to it than that, based on RAM as well.
[08:54] <Amanfire> well please explain
[08:54] <lordievader> For 64bit you need a cpu that supports is, that is probably why 32bit is recommended. However if you have a cpu that supports 64bit and you are rocking more than 2GB of ram, go for 64bit.
[08:55] <Amanfire> ok
[08:56] <lordievader> If you have 2gb or less, it doesn't really matter.
[08:57] <Amanfire> umm... ok so I'll grab the 64 bit iso... I'll be using the wubi installer because I'm still on a bios system
[08:57] <Amanfire> however with the same iso if I upgrade next year to a uefi can I use the same iso?
[08:58] <lordievader> Wubi is a curse, don't use it, you'll regret it.
[08:58] <Amanfire> why so?
[08:58] <lordievader> For as far as I know UEFI is still a bit of a problem.
[08:59] <lordievader> Amanfire: If you are a beginner and want to try it out it is fine, however when you grow and want to start using Ubu more you'll run into limitations.
[09:00] <Amanfire> ok
[09:01] <Amanfire> & there's no ubuntu that handles uefi at all?
[09:02] <lordievader> Amanfire: Have to say I don't know anything about UEFI, it might work...
[09:02] <lordievader> Amanfire: http://askubuntu.com/questions/91484/how-to-boot-ubuntu-from-efi-uefi
[09:03] <Amanfire> grub efi.... interesting

[14:39] <swords> does anyone know what % of desktops run Kubuntu vs. Ubuntu?
[14:51] <leonardocr> hola
[14:52] <BluesKaj> swords, roughly 10% afaik , but the real question is how many run KDE vs gnome/unity ?
[14:53] <BluesKaj> on linux
[14:53] <swords> BluesKaj: well that was my next question.  Why not run Ubuntu with KDE?
[14:53] <BluesKaj> kubuntu is ubuntu with kde
[14:55] <swords> so no other differences?
[14:56] <genii> !es | leonardocr
[14:56] <ubottu> leonardocr: En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #ubuntu-es; escriba "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y presione intro.
[14:57] <BluesKaj> the apps are different for each DE , but both desktops can run gtk and kde apps
=== elong is now known as wwwki
[14:59] <leonardocr> thanks
[15:03] <swords> i've heard a lot of flack for the Unity interface on Ubuntu.  i thought GNU fans were more loyal than that.
[15:05]  * BluesKaj shrugs , never cared for gnome  , unity woke up a lot of ppl to the benefits of KDE , IMO.

[17:47] <chachan> guys, I have a Lenovo ThinkPad L420 and I'm having temp issues since I bought it (almost a year ago). A friend just asked me for my fan speed and we realized that it's about 720RPM
[17:48] <thomas__> salut
[17:48] <lordievader> Hey thomas__ 
[17:49] <chachan> which looks slow, we open it out and clean it and still has the same speed, I tried with sensors-detect and pwmconfig to increase the speed, but it seems that my chip or something doesn't support changing speed control to manual, so it's in auto
[17:50] <lordievader> chachan: This might be helpful: http://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?57279-How-to-Enable-power-management-features
[17:50] <chachan> the problem is that it got 85° degrees (C)
[17:50] <chachan> and shutdown my PC

[18:14] <chachan> lordievader, that didn't work. I just saw this in my syslog http://paste.kde.org/p7510b10e/
[18:15] <chachan> also I checked a proc file and found this: http://paste.kde.org/p5e2af364/
[18:16] <chachan> I think I need to have the level set on full-speed
[18:16] <chachan> but instead it's on 5
[18:16] <chachan> and idea?
[18:16] <lordievader> chachan: You did run the thinkfan utility with root privelleges?
[18:16] <chachan> lordievader, I followed the guide that the guy from the forum wrote
