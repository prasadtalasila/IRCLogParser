[18:11] <nikolaj_basher> Is there some one who has worked with vpn
[18:13] <juancarlospaco> me
[18:13] <juancarlospaco> connect from bash
[18:19] <nikolaj_basher> juancarlospaco, have you use kubuntu for the vpn?
[18:19] <juancarlospaco> ye
[18:20] <juancarlospaco> sudo openconnect ....
[18:20] <juancarlospaco> from konsole
[18:20] <BluesKaj> nikolaj_basher, yes , I have worked with L2TP/ipsec vpn
[18:21] <juancarlospaco> the gui dont work without a package named vpnc-scripts
[18:21] <nikolaj_basher> BluesKaj, I have a vps DEbian and I would like to install kubuntu and use this for vpn
[18:22] <juancarlospaco> but at that time i didnt know that
[18:22] <nikolaj_basher> is there a guide for this some where, The guides I found was nothing worth
[18:23] <BluesKaj> juancarlospaco, what vpn clients do you have available ion the package manager?
[18:24] <juancarlospaco> a lot
[18:24] <juancarlospaco> only openconnect was the one I needed, but that depends on the vpn server itself
[18:25] <juancarlospaco> not all are the same, nor compatible
[18:25] <BluesKaj> or do you nee a specific client that comnnects to a server that runs a specific type like openvpn
[18:27] <juancarlospaco> depends on the vpn server
[18:27] <nikolaj_basher> BluesKaj, I would be nice if I coul connect from my tablet
[18:27] <BluesKaj> I use the L2TP/ipsec on the servers i connect to simce that's the requirement , openvpn hasn't been successful for me
[18:27] <juancarlospaco> the cisco one are compatible with: cisco, cisco,  cisco, cisco, cisco, cisco, cisco, cisco, cisco, cisco,  or cisco
[18:28] <juancarlospaco> :P
[18:28] <BluesKaj> \on openvpn servers
[18:28] <BluesKaj> , that is
[18:28] <BluesKaj> oh cisco
[18:28] <BluesKaj> I have no experiencwe with them
[18:28] <juancarlospaco> you must know what the other end point is
[18:29] <BluesKaj> yes
[18:31] <BluesKaj> I use a group of servers bases in Japan called VPNGate , they're non-commercial open source
[18:32] <BluesKaj> mainly meant for users in asian countries that block western websites, but since they're free I've used them for the las5 few months
[18:36] <nikolaj_basher> thanks for inspiration
