[04:03] <smartboyhw> Whoohoo my main PPA is now 6GiB:)
[04:11] <smartboyhw> Damn, quantal 4.10.97 is now just last step away from ready, but I just can't make kate and pykde4 happy...
[05:13] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: no endorsements is fine, I didn't get any as well, it was mostly that the the most active developers should be familiar with your work
[05:23] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, uh
[05:23] <smartboyhw> OK:P
[05:23] <shadeslayer> did someone setup a doodle?
[05:23] <smartboyhw> Then the wiki page really needs an update
[05:24] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, let me go and setup one
[05:24] <shadeslayer> if not I can send an email out regarding that since Riddell is out
[05:24] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: cool
[05:26] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, where should we hold the meeting?
[05:26] <smartboyhw> Here or #ubuntu-meeting?
[05:26] <jussi> here is usual
[05:27] <jussi> shadeslayer: we all thought you were crap, but we liked you so much we let you in :P :P :P :P : P :P
[05:27] <valorie> pffff
[05:27] <smartboyhw> jussi, LOL
[05:27] <smartboyhw> pffffff
[05:27] <shadeslayer> :)
[05:28]  * jussi hugs shadeslayer
[05:28]  * shadeslayer huggles jussi back
[05:28] <smartboyhw> Please enter a value.
[05:28] <smartboyhw> What!?!?
[05:28] <shadeslayer> jussi: oh and btw, you've lost alot of weight :O
[05:28] <smartboyhw> I can't even set the title......\
[05:28] <shadeslayer> jussi: or maybe you just look good in the camera :P
[05:28] <jussi> shadeslayer: 13 kg
[05:29] <shadeslayer> jussi: congrats :D
[05:29] <jussi> shadeslayer: still about 10 to go
[05:29] <shadeslayer> jussi: is that Elodi's doing :P
[05:29] <shadeslayer> keeping you up at night, making you run after her etc
[05:29] <jussi> shadeslayer: no, its just my love of bacon... m Im on a bacon diet! :D
[05:29] <shadeslayer> there's a bacon *diet* ? :D
[05:30] <jussi> not quite, but my diet includes bacon...
[05:30] <jussi> I started in feb, and Ive now lost 13kg. I wonder what ill look like in feb next year
[05:31]  * shadeslayer needs to start working out as well, I've gotten so fat -.-
[05:31] <jussi> hehe
[05:32] <jussi> shadeslayer: its funny, when you are big, workouts are soo hard, you give up. but if you can modify your diet and loose a little, then the workouts come much easier
[05:33] <shadeslayer> oh
[05:33] <shadeslayer> I'm not as big as you yet, I can still start
[05:33] <shadeslayer> I'm just lazy ...
[05:35] <jussi> shadeslayer: ++ I know that feeling, careful or youll end up as big as i was
[05:35] <shadeslayer> jussi: yeah, hopefully will be better once I move
[05:36] <jussi> shadeslayer: where are you moving to ? finally coming to join me here in .fi? 
[05:36] <ScottK> He'd freeze in a week.
[05:36] <ScottK> Even in summer.
[05:37] <jussi> haha
[05:37] <jussi> ScottK: come on, we had 30C yesterday!
[05:37] <smartboyhw> ScottK, shadeslayer you should have received an invitation of the Doodle poll now. I shall post the public address to kubuntu-devel mailin list soon
[05:38] <shadeslayer> jussi: I'm planning to acclimatize to Barcelona first :P
[05:38] <shadeslayer> got it
[05:39] <ScottK> Didn't get it yet, but I greylist, so it's not surprising.
[05:43] <smartboyhw> ScottK, I used ubuntu@kitterman.com
[05:44] <smartboyhw> Thank you shadeslayer
[05:45] <shadeslayer> oh drat, I did not factor in various other meetings into my doodle stuff
[05:45]  * shadeslayer goes back to change
[05:49] <ScottK> Doodled.
[05:52] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, sure
[05:52] <smartboyhw> ScottK, thanks
[05:53] <smartboyhw> Whoa, it looks like 13:00 UTC of 9th (Fri) is the most popular right now

[05:59] <soee> good morning
[06:21] <valorie> http://fossforce.com/2013/07/whats-your-favorite-foss-or-linux-blog/ - Martin's blog is leading
[07:57] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.kde.org/p61a77235/
[07:57] <shadeslayer> yofel: that's for precise
[08:00] <jussi> sigh
[08:00] <jussi> silly kde, why do you show everyone whats on my screen when waking up?
[08:11] <apachelogger> porn leakage?
[08:11] <tsdgeos> jussi: given how "unstandard" ubuntu's sleeping methods are i would not blame kde apps so quickly
[08:11] <jussi> apachelogger: no, work laptop. 
[08:11] <jussi> tsdgeos: heh... I guess. in any case, Kubuntu has a bug
[08:12] <apachelogger> you know
[08:12] <apachelogger> I still think we should simply adopt systemd :P
[08:12] <shadeslayer> ^^
[08:12] <shadeslayer> and make it not crippled
[08:12] <apachelogger> cuz the upstart-logind bastard child of hell seems to not be so great :P
[08:13] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: put it in the agenda for the meeting?
[08:13] <apachelogger> what meeting?
[08:13] <jussi> apachelogger: topic :D
[08:13] <shadeslayer> ^^
[08:14] <apachelogger> wait what
[08:14] <apachelogger> it's in the topic too
[08:14] <apachelogger> dafuq
[08:14]  * jussi hugs apachelogger
[08:14] <jussi> apachelogger: sounds like you need a coffee...
[08:14] <apachelogger> so I was out for the weekend and today I turn on the magic box which makes light come out of this very dark mirror
[08:14] <apachelogger> and I look at my mail
[08:15] <apachelogger> and there's 3 threads about smartboyhw's membership thing
[08:15] <apachelogger> and now I also find it on IRC
[08:15] <yofel> shadeslayer: hm, that's better than what I got 
[08:15] <shadeslayer> yofel: oh
[08:15] <apachelogger> tales from "how to make apachelogger not care" :P
[08:15] <yofel> though amarok and kde-workspace don't belong on the removal list
[08:15] <shadeslayer> you don't say :P
[08:15] <yofel> ^^
[08:16] <apachelogger> xserver-xorg
[08:16] <apachelogger> that seems x driven though
[08:16] <apachelogger> libgl1-mesa-dri or that maybe, seeing as X possibly deps on that
[08:16] <apachelogger> ah
[08:16] <apachelogger> now I get it
[08:17] <apachelogger> we are pulling in the lts enablement stack?
[08:17] <shadeslayer> yes
[08:17] <apachelogger> aaaaahhhhhhhhh
[08:17] <apachelogger> yes, linkage seems kaput in workspace then
[08:17] <apachelogger> kwin wants regular x, doesn't get it, goes away
[08:18] <shadeslayer> checking
[08:19] <apachelogger> amarok doesn't quite make sense though
[08:20] <apachelogger> at least on raring it doesn't have any deps on any other package marked for removal
[08:22] <apachelogger> deps libx11-6, which may or may not be the cause here
[08:23] <shadeslayer> Don't think it's libx11
[08:23] <shadeslayer> because there is no libx11 LTS backport
[08:24] <apachelogger> well, there's nothing else :P
[08:26]  * apachelogger hates writing changelogs -.-
[08:26] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: actually you could just let apt tell you :P
[08:26] <apachelogger> apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=yes dist-upgrade
[08:26] <apachelogger> or somesuch business
[08:26] <yofel> right
[08:27] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[08:28] <yofel> smartboyhw: uh, the pykde build failure is pretty clear though, python-qt4 depends on sip-api-8.1, while python-sip provides sip-api-10.0
[08:29] <yofel> you python-qt4 is too old
[08:29] <yofel> *your
[08:30] <yofel> doodled btw.
[08:31] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/p1ee7c81a/
[08:38] <shadeslayer> we need to rebuild amarok against the new HWE stack as well I think
[08:38] <yofel> oh right
[08:38] <yofel> I'll backport the beta
[08:38] <yofel> 2.7 crashes with 4.11 anyway
[08:38] <shadeslayer> ack
[08:39]  * shadeslayer looks at kde-workspace then
[08:40] <shadeslayer> aha
[08:40] <shadeslayer> Broken kde-window-manager-common:amd64 Depends on libgl1-mesa-glx [ amd64 ] < 8.0.4-0ubuntu0.6 > ( libs )
[08:42] <yofel> dpkg-shlibdeps is fun, isn't it?
[08:43] <shadeslayer> ^^
[08:47] <yofel> $ cat debian/libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-raring.shlibs 
[08:47] <yofel> libGL 1 libgl1-mesa-glx | libgl1
[08:47] <afiestas> smartboyhw: yes
[08:47] <yofel> uhm
[08:47] <shadeslayer> *facedesk*
[08:48] <yofel> I think we need to ask the X folks how this is *supposed* to work
[08:48]  * shadeslayer pokes X people
[09:18] <yofel> so...
[09:18] <yofel> we have the choice between 2 not recommended things we can do :/
[09:20] <yofel> a) default to mesa 8 (not recommended by martin)
[09:20] <yofel> b) explicitely pull in the mesa stack with manual depends (not recommened by ubuntu-x)
[09:21] <shadeslayer> do a) and ask users to install the lts stack?
[09:21] <yofel> probably the best solution indeed, at least it's the one with the least amount of breakage potential
[09:22] <shadeslayer> yep ^^
[09:22] <shadeslayer> only that this means we get to upload everything again
[09:23] <yofel> well, shouldn't be much of an issue
[09:23] <yofel> but qt and meta need to be fixed too
[09:23] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[09:23] <shadeslayer> oh
[09:23] <shadeslayer> yofel: can't we just make meta depend on the LTS stack
[09:23] <yofel> well, it already *does*
[09:23] <yofel> doesn't help
[09:24] <shadeslayer> uhm right
[09:24] <shadeslayer> oh?
[09:24] <yofel> The following packages will be REMOVED:
[09:24] <yofel> ... kubuntu-desktop kubuntu-full
[09:24] <shadeslayer> :/
[09:24] <shadeslayer> yofel: but isn't that because of kde-window-manager
[09:25] <shadeslayer> so if we fix everything to build against regular mesa, but make the meta package depend on the HWE stack
[09:25] <shadeslayer> then during the upgrade it'll pull in the new HWE stack
[09:25] <yofel> it'll remove the meta packages on upgrade. But that would at least provide an easy way to install the HWE stack
[09:26] <yofel> that's what kubuntu-lts-backport is supposed to do currently
[09:27] <yofel> but just trying to install that ends up with
[09:27] <yofel>  kubuntu-lts-backport : Depends: xserver-xorg-lts-raring but it is not going to be installed
[09:27] <shadeslayer> o_o
[09:29] <yofel> shadeslayer: ok, how about this: revert back to default mesa, allow kubuntu-desktop to use both and provide kubuntu-lts-backport to install the full HWE stack
[09:29] <shadeslayer> yofel: yeah, that's what was going through my mind as well
[09:30] <yofel> then lets go with that. I'll upload a qt rebuild
[09:30] <shadeslayer> but didn't you just say that kubuntu-lts-backport isn't installable?
[09:31] <yofel> no here, and 'apt-get install kubuntu-lts-backport xserver-xorg-lts-raring' results in: http://paste.kde.org/pbb07556c
[09:31] <yofel> *not here
[09:32] <yofel> but that package doesn't really do much right now:
[09:32] <yofel> kubuntu-lts-backport
[09:32] <yofel>   Depends: linux-image-generic-lts-raring
[09:32] <yofel>   Depends: xserver-xorg-lts-raring
[09:33] <yofel> and I think we'll need at least the manual dependencies on mesa
[09:34] <yofel> apt-get install kubuntu-lts-backport libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-raring
[09:34] <yofel> looks much better
[09:42] <yofel> qt uploaded
[09:43] <shadeslayer> ack
[09:44] <shadeslayer> I suppose I could go for a quick nap :P
[09:44] <yofel> go ahead, this'll take 4h ^^
[09:44] <jussi> shadeslayer: or have a swordfight... :D http://xkcd.com/303/
[09:45] <shadeslayer> jussi: oh that was this morning
[09:45] <jussi> haha
[09:45] <shadeslayer> when Qt tests were running :)
[09:48] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, yofel sorry for spamming mailing list
[09:48] <smartboyhw> yofel, yeah I know..
[09:48] <smartboyhw> afiestas, oh good:)
[09:48] <yofel> what about the ML?
[09:49] <smartboyhw> yofel, I mean apachelogger receiving 3 emails:P
[09:49] <yofel> ah
[09:49] <apachelogger> well, in all fairness, I am important like that
[09:49] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, yes, you are VERY important:)
[09:50] <apachelogger> I am now working 3 hours and am still reading backmail from the weekend
[09:50] <apachelogger> quite the drag -.-
[09:51] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, where's kubotu?
[09:52] <apachelogger> vacation
[09:52] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, .....
[09:52] <smartboyhw> If you would kindly make it back?
[09:53] <afiestas> smartboyhw: as soon as a package reaches the ftp, it means it is ready for download/package/etc
[09:53] <smartboyhw> afiestas, yeah, I've packaged it here already:)
[09:53] <afiestas> I haven't announce it (or Dan) because we are busy
[09:53] <afiestas> awesome! thanks
[09:53] <apachelogger> hm
[09:54] <afiestas> can I get an update of Kubuntu freeze?
[09:54] <afiestas> I'd like to release KScreen 1.1 before it
[09:54] <smartboyhw> afiestas, Kubuntu Freeze? You mean, Feature Freeze?
[09:54] <apachelogger> jussi, tsimpson: didn't we have an upstart/init.d script for kubotu?
[09:54]  * apachelogger kubuntu freezes afiestas
[09:54] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, +1
[09:54] <apachelogger> August 29th
[09:54] <apachelogger> Warning /!\ FeatureFreeze, Beta 1 Freeze (for opt-in flavors)
[09:54] <tsimpson> apachelogger: we don't
[09:54] <apachelogger> tsimpson: curious
[09:54] <smartboyhw> afiestas, FeatureFreeze and Beta1Freeze is on August 29th
[09:55] <apachelogger> I guess I should write one then ^^
[09:55] <tsimpson> you can create a cron job too/instead
[09:55] <tsimpson> if you do write an upstart job, I'd like that :)
[09:56] <apachelogger> same amount of work as the trick is figuring out how to get a screen with kubotu started as my user
[09:56] <apachelogger> which is why I thouht we had a script because I definitely remember working on that
[09:56] <apachelogger> oh well
[09:56] <tsimpson> also, we'll be moving ubottu.com to 13.04 soon (as soon as I get everything transferred to the new server)
[09:56] <apachelogger> at least manually starting kubotu gives me the chance to update it every once in a while ^^
[09:57] <smartboyhw> kubotu: newversion libkscreen 1.0.1
[09:57] <smartboyhw> HAHAHA
[09:57] <kubotu> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1208409
[09:58] <apachelogger> kubotu: hey
[09:58] <kubotu> morning apachelogger :D
[09:59] <smartboyhw> kubotu: newversion kscreen 1.0.1
[10:00] <kubotu> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1208413
[10:01] <tsimpson> apachelogger: you can pass -b when starting the bot to background it too, so no need for screen
[10:02] <smartboyhw> -queuebot/#ubuntu-release- Unapproved: accepted ibus-cangjie [source] (raring-proposed) [0.0.1~git20130325-0ubuntu1.1]
[10:02] <smartboyhw> Oops, wrong chan:P
[10:02]  * smartboyhw is supposed to post it in another one, sorry folks
[10:08] <smartboyhw> yofel, any time to review kscreen and libkscreen?
[10:08] <smartboyhw> It's in https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/packaging-staging-1/+packages
[10:08] <smartboyhw> (A new PPA:P)
[10:09] <smartboyhw> Hmm, why are you guys more free on Fridays? :O
[10:15] <apachelogger> tsimpson: yes, but I like having it on a screen :P
[10:15] <shadeslayer> hm, 4.12 beta releases happen within one week
[10:15] <tsimpson> ok then
[10:15] <apachelogger> it's an OCD thing ^^
[10:15] <shadeslayer> not sure if that's enough time to get them out quickly enough :/
[10:16] <shadeslayer> not to mention Kubuntu get's about 15 days of upstream support \o/
[10:16] <shadeslayer> ( assuming Kubuntu is released in the middle of April )
[10:17] <shadeslayer> for an LTS release that sounds awesome
[10:17] <apachelogger> fails to compute
[10:17] <shadeslayer> http://techbase.kde.org/Schedules/KDE4/4.12_Release_Schedule
[10:17] <shadeslayer> Tuesday, April 29 2014: KDE 4.12.5 release
[10:19] <shadeslayer> oh actually, if previous release is any indication, the x.04 release is made towards the end of the month
[10:30] <yofel> shadeslayer: less time between releases also means less changes we need to take into account
[10:31] <yofel> so I think it would work (for beta2+)
[10:31] <shadeslayer> right, just saying that by the time we'll be done with beta 1 , beta 2 will be close to tagging
[10:31] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, as in 4.11 anyway
[10:32] <smartboyhw> yofel, will you review kscreen?
[10:32] <shadeslayer> nope
[10:32] <smartboyhw> and libkscreen ofc
[10:32] <yofel> shadeslayer: not in the next 6h
[10:32] <shadeslayer> Beta 1 and Beta 2 had 2 weeks in between them
[10:32] <yofel> er, smartboyhw^
[10:32] <shadeslayer> I can have a look
[10:32] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, great
[10:32] <yofel> yeah, 1 week is a bit short
[10:33] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, they are in https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/packaging-staging-1/+packages
[10:33] <yofel> considering we need at least 2 days to actually get the beta out
[10:33] <shadeslayer> I am not sure why Riddell didn't send the suggestions we decided on to the ML
[10:33] <yofel> leaves at most 5 days for testing
[10:33] <shadeslayer> 2 days? hah, first Beta usually takes alot more time
[10:33] <shadeslayer> new deps, new files and what not
[10:33] <smartboyhw> yofel, how long did we take to get Beta 1 ou?
[10:33] <yofel> in *saucy*, not saucy+1 because that needs another 2 days or so until it's through -proposed
[10:33] <smartboyhw> in 4.11?
[10:34] <shadeslayer> well, 4.12 comes out post saucy release
[10:34] <shadeslayer> that's what I was talking about
[10:34] <yofel> sure, I'm talking about testing
[10:34] <shadeslayer> uhm, last 2 sentences make no sense :P
[10:34] <yofel> well, we can do the beta backports *fast*
[10:34] <shadeslayer> 4.12 comes out post saucy, so we put it in saucy + 1 first
[10:34] <yofel> building in saucy+1 archive takes longer
[10:34] <yofel> so less testing in the dev release
[10:35] <shadeslayer> right
[10:35] <yofel> that's all I said
[10:35] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[10:35] <shadeslayer> backporting is fast
[10:35] <yofel> beta1 packaging takes about a week usually, which is why I said beta2+
[10:35] <yofel> beta1 will never see a release in kubuntu with *that* schedule I fear
[10:36] <shadeslayer> afiestas: tsdgeos ^^
[10:36] <shadeslayer> and upstream will get loads of bug reports post 14.04 release
[10:36] <yofel> but that's an estimate based on recent experience
[10:36] <shadeslayer> nothing we can do about that as well
[10:36] <yofel> are there git moves planned for 4.12?
[10:36] <yofel> (kdewebdev?)
[10:37] <tsdgeos> shadeslayer: thought luck for you i guess :D
[10:38] <tsdgeos> let's delay the world because i'm slow!
[10:38] <smartboyhw> So, we will be uploading to devel soon...
[10:38] <smartboyhw> Probably saucy+1
[10:38] <yofel> if we don't have git splitups we can do beta1 within 4 days I believe
[10:38] <smartboyhw> The *rolling release* symlink thing.
[10:39] <yofel> smartboyhw: wasn't that meant to be an *additional* target?
[10:39] <tsdgeos> shadeslayer: if oyu can't get beta1, you can do beta2, or you can start working on "non beta tarballs" if that helps, or...
[10:39] <shadeslayer> tsdgeos: depends entirely on how much you change :P
[10:39] <yofel> smartboyhw: though unification would make sense I guess
[10:39] <smartboyhw> yofel, well it seems like we can upload to it
[10:39] <shadeslayer> if there are alot of changes, then it'll take time
[10:39] <yofel> shadeslayer: well, we have kdelibs and kde-workspace frozen
[10:39] <smartboyhw> You can still ofc upload to saucy, saucy+1
[10:40] <shadeslayer> yofel: right, but there are like a bazillion other things 
[10:40] <yofel> not that much, if anything it's finding out what dependencies need to be updated
[10:40] <yofel> that easily causes a day of delay
[10:40] <yofel> though we could do that *before* beta1 really
[10:43] <smartboyhw> Going for a swim..
[10:43] <smartboyhw> Riddell, please vote on the Trello:P
[10:43] <yofel> tsdgeos: one thing though: are you sure you can keep the release dates? with tagging and release on the same day in 4.11 we had a few cases where the tars were online a day or two after the tagging.
[10:43] <yofel> Considering we only have 1 week to work with them such a delay becomes a problem
[10:46] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: diffs look sane to me
[10:46] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: will upload once they're built
[10:54] <Riddell> smartboyhw: vote on trello?
[10:58] <shadeslayer> Riddell: he probably meant doodle
[11:01] <Riddell> ok done
[11:06] <shadeslayer> Riddell: and what happened to the suggestion we made regarding having a growing period between bug fix releases?
[11:06] <yofel> growing period?
[11:07] <shadeslayer> yeah, like 4.12.1 3 weeks after 4.12, 4.12.2 6 weeks after 4.12.1
[11:07] <shadeslayer> so on and so forth
[11:07] <yofel> oh that
[11:07] <yofel> dunno
[11:09] <shadeslayer> *shrug* as long as I don't have to deal with bug reports and all of them go upstream ;)
[11:09] <yofel> shadeslayer: sure, all of them will be RESOLVED EOL though

[11:10] <yofel> well, probably not
[11:10] <yofel> but still
[12:30] <smartboyhw> Riddell, thank you!
[12:31] <smartboyhw> Hmm, probably 16th 13:00 UTC then.....
[12:36] <smartboyhw> Riddell, is it that you wanted a news release for calligra 2.7.1? It has migrated into -release now
[12:49] <Riddell> smartboyhw: oh cool if it's migrated and raring and precise are done then go for it
[13:02] <smartboyhw> Riddell, no precise sorry
[13:03] <smartboyhw> It can't work without g++-4.7
[13:03] <smartboyhw> I can only do Quantal
[13:07] <BluesKaj> Hey folks
[13:08] <Quintasan> Riddell: Do we support things like 12.04 -> 13.04?
[13:08] <Quintasan> or it's only LTS -> LTS upgrades that we support?
[13:14] <davmor2> Quintasan: update-manager -d will take you out of the lts→lts 
[13:14] <Quintasan> davmor2: I might be dumb but wouldn't -d install saucy?
[13:15] <Quintasan> Current development release is saucy iirc
[13:15] <davmor2> Quintasan: d'oh yeap sorry
[13:15] <davmor2> Quintasan: it in software-properties-gtk for me on ubuntu so I'm assuming there is a qt version maybe?

[13:16] <smartboyhw> highvoltage, !?

[13:26] <smartboyhw> Ah, it's actually score damn:P
[13:26] <smartboyhw> 4/5 that's quite good
[13:27] <yofel> smartboyhw: are you actually sure it failed with gcc-4.6? because we do have 2.7.0 in the precise backports
[13:27] <smartboyhw> yofel, g++
[13:27] <smartboyhw> Not gcc
[13:27] <yofel> same thing
[13:28] <smartboyhw> yofel, somebody give me the backlog

[13:28] <smartboyhw> *of
[13:28] <yofel> uh, look at the ppa?
[13:29] <smartboyhw> yofel, looking
[13:31] <smartboyhw> yofel, I think it's because I'm missing out some cmake things...
[13:32] <smartboyhw> Yeah
[13:34] <smartboyhw> Sorry:P
[13:36] <yofel> nah, backporting to precise isn't straight forward for most packages sadly :/
[13:36] <smartboyhw> yofel, uploaded a new version:P
[13:44] <smartboyhw> Hmm, this time it's amd64 PPA build queue in busy state
[13:52] <Quintasan> herp
[13:52] <Quintasan> $8M is it
[14:07] <afiestas> hey, is the akonadi systemtray still being installed by default?
[14:08] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, is kscreen and libkscreen ready?
[14:08] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: I was afk, I can upload now
[14:08] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, great, afiestas :)
[14:09] <smartboyhw> Oh, digikam is now officially 3.3.0
[14:09] <smartboyhw> kubotu: newversion digikam 3.3.0

[14:11] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, OK 
[14:11] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, maybe just reuse the old bugs to upgrade the software version
[14:11] <smartboyhw> And nominate for Raring?
[14:11] <smartboyhw> kscreen and libkscreen has MRE available:)
[14:13] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: yeah I suppose you could nominate those bugs for raring
[14:14] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, you nominate;P
[14:14] <smartboyhw> I don't have the privileges...
[14:14] <shadeslayer> done
[14:15] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, I think it will be better if you prepare the SRU, you can upload directly:)
[14:15] <smartboyhw> I mean, I've done 1 SRU myself
[14:15] <smartboyhw> But that one has nobody to upload at all:P
[14:15] <shadeslayer> uploaded for saucy
[14:17] <smartboyhw> Uh oh, digikam download is real slow
[14:18] <shadeslayer> you don't say
[14:18] <shadeslayer> with the embedded libs and what not :)
[14:18] <ScottK> afiestas: It is.  Akonadi isn't reliable enough yet not to have it.
[14:19] <ScottK> (or if it isn't, it's a bug, IMO)
[14:19] <afiestas> ScottK: then it is being installed?
[14:20] <ScottK> It is in raring.  IDK for sure about saucy.  It should be.
[14:20] <afiestas> removing of it was specifically recommended by kdepim-developers, and the by the time akonadi maintainer
[14:20] <afiestas> and from what I remember it was super evil, in one of the UDS I told you to remove it following Volker advice and iirc you said you would (and I remember seeing it gone)
[14:21] <afiestas> but for some reason, it is on a friend's laptop and in my parent's (my parents laptop has been upgraded from previous versions)

[14:22] <shadeslayer> yep, we ship it in saucy ^^
[14:22] <ScottK> afiestas: I use it on roughly a daily basis to restart akonadi stuff that's messed up.
[14:22] <afiestas> I compile everything, and I don't have it
[14:23] <afiestas> ScottK: maybe you need to restart it daily because you are using it
[14:23] <afiestas> it was *super* evil iirc, and I haven't seen any change on it
[14:23] <ScottK> Then what's the alternative?
[14:23] <ScottK> akonadiconsole is super dangerous.
[14:23] <afiestas> akonadictl restart, I guess
[14:23] <shadeslayer> ^^ which is what I use
[14:24] <afiestas> shadeslayer: so it is not in rarin?

[14:24] <shadeslayer> I'm merely saying that it is also present in saucy
[14:24] <afiestas> oks, can we check backwards?
[14:25] <afiestas> I do remember that you guys removed it and I remember agreeing on that in an UDS
[14:25]  * shadeslayer checks precise and quantal
[14:25] <afiestas> shadeslayer: thanks
[14:27] <ScottK> It's there.  I've used it since we switched to akonadi based pim.
[14:27] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, so you want me to do the SRU or you?
[14:27] <shadeslayer> afiestas: ScottK I don't think precise has it, probably because 4.8.5 didn't have it?
[14:28] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: I was reviewing the diffs
[14:28] <afiestas> shadeslayer: it did

[14:29] <shadeslayer> right
[14:29] <shadeslayer> like I said, didn't give me a hit in the query
[14:29] <afiestas> wait, maybe we removed it from being autostarted ?
[14:29] <afiestas> having it packaged should be ok I guess, as long as it is not started automagically
[14:30] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, BTW next time, don't upload kscreen and libkscreen at the same time:P
[14:30] <afiestas> if somebody like ScottK wants to use it, that's ok 
[14:30] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: why not?
[14:30] <shadeslayer> afiestas: it's not started automatically here
[14:30] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, because all the kscreen are now in dep-wait
[14:30] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: and it'll resolve automatically
[14:31] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, actually, how long does it take to automatically resolve?
[14:31] <ScottK> afiestas: Until akonadi is substantially more reliable, I think it's important to have a GUI way to restart it.
[14:31] <ScottK> If that's not it, I'm happy to have another.
[14:31] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: soonish after libkscreen is built
[14:31] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, good:)
[14:38] <afiestas> ScottK: you can bring that to kdepim-devel I guess, I know you are really frustrated with kdepim, but restarting akonadi is not the solution anyway
[14:38] <ScottK> I don't know what is?
[14:39] <afiestas> reporting bugs, providing feedback (specially now that we have a maintainer with time) etc
[14:40] <afiestas> we went through a similar process with nepomuk, it turned out nice
[14:40] <afiestas> I trust same will happen now that Dan is a maintainer with time
[14:41] <ScottK> It has steadily gotten better.
[14:42] <ScottK> But in the mean time, I have to have working mail and when akonadi services get hung, it has to be restarted.
[14:49] <shadeslayer> ScottK: btw do you have an idea why Nepomuk in Kubuntu uses unix odbc whereas Debian uses iodbc 
[14:49] <shadeslayer> I know we have a patch, but do you know the history behind it?
[14:49] <ScottK> Yes.  I don't recall the details, but it was slangasek that did it.
[14:50] <shadeslayer> okay, opinions on going back to iodbc since that's what upstream recommends?
[14:50]  * vHanda eaves
[14:50] <vHanda> *waves
[14:50] <shadeslayer> hey hey :)
[14:50] <vHanda> I read the entire bug report, and I'm not sure what to do now.
[14:51] <shadeslayer> I see, and why was this change introduced?
[14:52] <vHanda> some clashes with mysql or some other db. And since iodbc hadn't been updated in a couple of years they decided to drop it
[14:52] <vHanda> overall, both work perfectly and they are supposed to 
[14:52] <vHanda> but I do get a lot of bug reports regarding high memory usage of virtuoso which I can reproduce, but they seem to happen more often with unixodbc. Anway, I haven't tested this properly
[14:52] <shadeslayer> any demerits to using unixodbc instead of iodbc?
[14:53] <vHanda> so just let the situation be
[14:53] <shadeslayer> okay then
[14:53] <vHanda> I'll bug you people if I find a convincing reason to switch - the main reason was that virtuoso maintains iodbc so it theoretically should work better
[14:53] <vHanda> with virtuoso
[14:55] <yofel> shadeslayer: for reference if you want to read through it: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=639300

[14:59] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh great:)
[14:59] <smartboyhw> Yes, digikam finally arrived

[16:15] <ScottK> afiestas: Why did you remove class AbstractBackend from src/configmonitor.h in libkscreen 1.0.1?  Is that a binary compatible change?
[16:15] <afiestas> ScottK: we don't keep binary comnpatibility
[16:15] <ScottK> BTW, 1.0 is released to updates.
[16:16] <afiestas> and we haven't removed it I think :s
[16:16] <afiestas> at least not in prupose :/
[16:16] <ScottK> It is in other files, but that being remove from src/configmonitor.h is in the diff.
[16:16] <afiestas> the include?
[16:16] <shadeslayer> ScottK: I think it's a forward include

[16:17] <shadeslayer> last line
[16:17] <ScottK> Yeah.
[16:17] <shadeslayer> ScottK: yeah, from what I understand it's a forward include and can be dropped
[16:17] <ScottK> afiestas: It's fine not to keep binary compatibility, but you need to bump the so name when you don't.
[16:22] <afiestas> we did I think
[16:22] <afiestas> 1.0.1, no?
[16:22] <afiestas> or 1.1 is required if we break it?
[16:56] <yofel> afiestas: on ABI breakage you would have to bump the SOVERSION, for you that's libkscreen_VERSION_MAJOR
[16:56] <yofel> but we're fine here as fas Howard was concerned
[16:57] <yofel> *as far as
[16:58] <afiestas> we bump the minor, isn;t that enough?
[16:58] <afiestas> I don't want to end up with soversion 25
[16:58] <afiestas> and call it libkscreen 2.0
[16:59] <yofel> no, it wouldn't be enough for a BIC change
[17:00] <yofel> and libkscreen is at 22...
[17:00] <yofel> er
[17:00] <yofel> libkdcraw
[17:00] <yofel> but ok, bad example
[17:01] <yofel> afiestas: nothing prevents you from using longer SOVERSION's though... libattica has '0.4'
[17:05] <afiestas> so, from 1.0.1 to 1..0.1 iok?
[17:07] <yofel> you're mixing VERSION and SOVERSION, you can set VERSION to whatever you want, SOVERSION only needs to change if you remove symbols from the library 
[17:07] <yofel> current SOVERSION is '1'
=== dantti_laptop|2 is now known as dantti_laptop
[17:13] <afiestas> oh I thought we had it unified
[17:14] <yofel> it is partly, first part of the VERSION is the SOVERSION, you if you change the libkscreen version to 2.0.0 you change the SOVERSION
[17:15] <yofel> not sure if that coupling make sense, but it's ok as long as the ABI isn't broken in between
[17:16] <shadeslayer> hm, is there a way we can express this in a install file : "Install everything under /usr except for these 2 files"
[17:19] <yofel> shadeslayer: 'rm' in rules
[17:20] <shadeslayer> nah, that's fairly less than ideal
[17:21] <yofel> well, then you can just add all files except for the 2 you want to install to the install file
[17:21] <yofel> that's the debian way
