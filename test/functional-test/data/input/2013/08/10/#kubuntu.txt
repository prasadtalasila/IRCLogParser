[01:33] <GH0> Hello, I am trying to fix certain applications from not showing up in the KDE Menu. I ran "kbuildsycoca4 -noincremental" however, when I do that, it complains about two files that don't appear in the menu to begin with. I checked their package with debsums -sc and it doesn't report anything back. So I was wondering how to go about replacing the files located in /usr/share/applications/
[01:33] <GH0> Is it possible to reinstall them somehow?
[01:33] <GH0> The error is as follows:
[01:33] <GH0> kbuildsycoca4(12617) KConfigGroup::readXdgListEntry: List entry Keywords in "/usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop" is not compliant with XDG standard (missing trailing semicolon).
[01:33] <GH0> kbuildsycoca4(12617) KConfigGroup::readXdgListEntry: List entry Categories in "/usr/share/applications/kde4/k4dirstat.desktop" is not compliant with XDG standard (missing trailing semicolon).
[01:33] <FloodBotK1> GH0: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:50] <valorie> GH0: did you try sudo apt-get install --reinstall <packagename>?
[03:50] <valorie> in a konsole
[03:51] <valorie> or just right-click on the menu and 'edit applications'?
[03:51] <valorie> which is what I would try first
[03:53] <GH0> I tried reinstalling with aptitude, disnt use that flag with apt-get though. I didnt try that, can right now.. hold on
[03:54] <valorie> ah, I haven't used aptitude for a long, long time
[03:54] <GH0> If i try roght clicking, i get presented with "Unable to contact Khotkeys"
[03:54] <valorie> oooo
[03:55] <valorie> sec
[03:55] <GH0> Though, i can bypass that and into the menu i think
[03:55] <GH0> I just dont see what caused the problem in the first p
[03:56] <GH0> bah... first placw
[03:56] <GH0> place
[03:56] <GH0> dang large hands and tiny tablet keys

[09:08] <KubuntuUser3a0f0> I am a freaking idiot, I have ruined my KDE
[09:08] <KubuntuUser3a0f0> Now it looks like a half-butted blend of KDE and Gnome
[09:10] <KubuntuUser3a0f0> Applications and Places buttons (but without text on them) and icons-only task manager in top bar, no bottom bar, tray and _analog_ clock in the middle of my screen
[09:10] <KubuntuUser3a0f0> How do I restore the desktop?
[10:13] <lj> helo
[10:13] <lj> :)
[10:17] <juancarlospaco> :)
[10:37] <lj> moze głupie pytanie pierwszy raz uzywam irca zna ktos jakis irc z php?
[10:51] <BluesKaj> Howdy folks
[11:33] <juancarlospaco> hehehehehe
[11:34] <BluesKaj> juancarlospaco, ok , what's so funny ?
[11:35] <juancarlospaco> I try to implement something kde cant find a tutorial or documentation that its not auto-generated-like BluesKaj
[11:36] <BluesKaj> juancarlospaco, what are you looking for ?'
[11:36] <juancarlospaco> I want to implement at least one of this two things:  kate-kdevelop snippets thingy OR kde themes menu on the menubar thingy  BluesKaj
[11:37] <juancarlospaco> on python
[11:37] <BluesKaj> ok , that's beyond my scope , juancarlospaco
[11:38] <juancarlospaco> ditto BluesKaj
[11:38] <BluesKaj> you might ask in #kubuntu-devel or #kde
[11:38] <juancarlospaco> yeah
[11:38] <juancarlospaco> they told read the source code BluesKaj
[11:38] <juancarlospaco> hehehehehe
[11:38] <BluesKaj> nice :(
[11:39] <smartboyhw> juancarlospaco, now, you should apply for Season of KDE at season.kde.org
[11:39] <smartboyhw> to implement the idea;P
[11:42] <juancarlospaco> what idea ?
[11:42] <juancarlospaco> :O
[11:43] <juancarlospaco> I want that menu that changes color of the window
[11:43] <juancarlospaco> or the snippets api
[11:43] <juancarlospaco> I know C++ but im not goind to read all that stuff to try to understand it
[11:44] <juancarlospaco> I will go with a pure Qt gui and paste.kde.org api
[11:44] <juancarlospaco> I think...
[11:44] <smartboyhw> juancarlospaco, better ask in #kde-soc
[11:45] <juancarlospaco> whats soc
[11:47] <juancarlospaco> it socs
[11:47] <juancarlospaco> :P
[11:48] <smartboyhw> juancarlospaco, eh anyway just go there and ask

[16:32] <cordawyn_> Hello! Could anyone help me "pacify" KDE daemon that keeps prompting me to install "Flash" package every time I start rekonq?
[16:33] <cordawyn_> well, apart from installing Flash ;-)
[16:36] <BluesKaj> cordawyn_, I think it's a bug , if youtube works ok , then flash is working
[16:37] <BluesKaj> try a different browser , to see if you receive the same message
[16:39] <BluesKaj> rconk isn't quite ready for use as a default browser IMO, I get segfaults once in a while , and my bank site insists rekonq isn't setup to receive cookies
[16:40] <cordawyn_> BluesKaj: I agree that there's room for improvement for rekonq, but this KDE daemon prompt is what annoys me the most for now
[16:45] <BluesKaj> well, you can file a bug on launchpad , but I doubt it will get much attention, there's a queue for rekonq bugfixes that goes back many yrs now, cordawyn_

[21:15] <GH0> So thanks to something, Google Chrome is now the default browser and even if I go through the file associations and tell Firefox to be the default browser, everything is still opened in chrome. Can I just delete all the kde files that associated with this account and will the be recreated on next login? Or is there a better way out there to do this. I also attempted xdg-settings and that failed as well.
[21:25] <valorie> GH0: have you checked with a new user?
[21:25] <valorie> or looked in .config ?
[21:25] <valorie> I mean ~/.config
[21:36] <TheMysteryMan> hey can anyone help me?
[21:36] <TheMysteryMan> my grub bootloader always fail's to install
[21:36] <Darthfrog1> Perhaps.
[21:37] <valorie> TheMysteryMan: have you looked at
[21:37] <valorie> !grub
[21:37] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2

[21:37] <TheMysteryMan> i used to have ubuntu before switching to this and it worked fine
[21:37] <TheMysteryMan> no errors during installation of ubuntu
[21:38] <Darthfrog1> TheMysteryMan:  Also, make sure that the drive mappings are correct and that you are really installing it on your boot drive.
[21:38] <TheMysteryMan> i am
[21:38] <TheMysteryMan> is there a way to install it on a system with a 1.5 tb hard drive and a 1 tb hard drive
[21:39] <Darthfrog1> Yes.  Should be no problem.
[21:39] <TheMysteryMan> i have problems installing it on an efi system:(
[21:39] <Darthfrog1> Do yourself a favour and install it on both drives. :)
[21:39] <Darthfrog1> Ah, don't know anything about EFI.
[21:39] <Darthfrog1> !efi
[21:39] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[21:42] <TheMysteryMan> thnx
[21:44] <TheMysteryMan> itt says : an error occured during the repair
[21:45] <TheMysteryMan> should i set my drives to AHCI,IDE or raid?
[21:49] <Darthfrog1> AHCI is the best.
[21:49] <Darthfrog1> Advanced Host Controller Interface
[21:49] <Darthfrog1> You always want AHCI with a SSD, BTW.
[21:50] <Darthfrog1> !ahci
[21:50] <TheMysteryMan> but i have a normal sata drive
[21:51] <TheMysteryMan> do i set it to IDE for EFI or AHCI
[21:51] <Darthfrog1> Right.
[21:51] <Darthfrog1> AHCI.
[21:51] <TheMysteryMan> but it is set to ahci and it still doesent work:(
