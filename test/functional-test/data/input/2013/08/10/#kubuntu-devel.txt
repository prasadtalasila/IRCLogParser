[09:01] <yofel> kopete updated
[09:42] <smartboyhw> yofel, weird. I have KDE with XMir here and it feels quicK:O
[09:43] <yofel> well, they did improve it. And on a fast enough machine you never really noticed the speed difference
[09:43] <yofel> it's mostly rendering glitches
[09:43] <smartboyhw> Even the typing is quick:O
[09:44] <debfx> it's quick because you don't notice the 10% overhead? ;)
[09:44] <smartboyhw> debfx, ?
[09:45] <debfx> that's what the -devel mail says

[21:26] <yofel> allee: ok, checked again, you were right about the kipi crash. For some reason ksnapshot is linked against the wrong libkipi version o.O
[21:27] <yofel> great, ksnapshot has an unversioned build-dep on libkipi-dev
[21:28] <yofel> no wonder this happened
