[19:44] <goddard> do you guys think it is a good idea when creating an open source project to say you cannot use this on OSX or Windows?
[19:46] <Ampelbein> goddard: That goes against everything open source stands for in my opinion.
[19:49] <penguin42> yeh I don't think that quite qualifies as open source
[19:49] <slangasek> goddard: restrictions on use are incompatible with Open Source, by definition

[20:17] <penguin42> is it possible to ask for a rebuild of the coccinelle package on saucy - for bug 1210855
[20:17] <ubottu> bug 1210855 in coccinelle (Ubuntu) "Coccinelle needs rebuild against newer ocaml" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1210855
[20:17] <penguin42> I'm not sure if this is a build-dep dependency or something magical about ocaml
[20:43] <goddard> it sucks making an open source project but then windows and mac guys just use it
[20:43] <goddard> and dont give anything to us
[20:44] <goddard> you if you used a closed source operating system you cannot use open source software
[20:44] <goddard> that should be like a rule
[20:44] <penguin42> goddard: Not necessarily
[20:44] <goddard> otherwise all the free work people do is just benifiting them
[20:44] <penguin42> goddard: There are a lot of users of things like openoffice on windows/mac and people who contribute changes to it back
[20:45] <goddard> Linux users have given so much but it is always a hassle to get larger companies to do small amounts of work to give their products to us
[20:47] <goddard> yet they use a lot of the open source tools and those guys dont care about ethics or morality or community
[20:47] <penguin42> goddard: Rather offtopic!  But not necessarily
[20:47] <goddard> It seems like unless that was put into place really all open source is ... is a tool for these larger companies to exploit while you believe your doing something good
[20:48] <penguin42> goddard: It's like getting people to switch their servers to Linux - if you can get them first to switch their servers it can be good, but to get them to do that you have to make sure it works well for their windows clients
[20:48] <goddard> penguin42: so far that method hasn't served us well
[20:48] <goddard> has it?
[20:49] <penguin42> goddard: Or the one I've personally had the experience of is a company with mostly Linux users but where the guys in the suit and the finance guys use Windows, so you have to cater for them
[20:49] <goddard> Why do we have to cater to them?
[20:50] <goddard> makes no sense
[20:50] <goddard> I think now is the perfect time for us to diverge away from helping them at all
[20:51] <penguin42> goddard: Because it's easier to get Linux systems in if the few WIndows users don't actually realise you're using something else in the back
[20:51] <goddard> at least that way we seem competitive which is what businesses want to see
[20:51] <goddard> we dont want to be in the back we want to be in the front
[20:52] <penguin42> goddard: Right but read what I said!
[20:52] <penguin42> goddard: In a situation where most users are Linux users if you also have to support a few Windows users, unless you can do that then you end up with Linux being pushed out
[20:53] <goddard> maybe that was true in the past
[20:53] <goddard> but not any more
[20:53] <penguin42> it might be easier now with a lot of web based stuff
[20:53] <goddard> linux only sucks in the graphics deparment i think nowadays
[20:54] <penguin42> goddard: But I know lots and lots of companies where devs can use Linux or Macs or whatever - but they're required to have a Windows VM to run Outlook; so they're still stuck with Windows!
[20:54] <goddard> hopefully GPU manufactuers can fix that with steam
[20:54] <penguin42> anyway, we're very offtopic and will get flame-grilled if we carry on
[20:54] <goddard> penguin42: outlook is going to the "cloud" so they might shot themselves in the foot
[20:54] <goddard> haha
[20:55] <goddard> alright but i wanted to talk about this with actual developers
