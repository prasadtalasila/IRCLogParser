[00:34] <claycorn> hello
[02:54] <xvicarious> Hey, I've had a little trouble in getting grub set up properly.  When I installed it said grub had failed.  So I booted from grub recovery and tried running boot-repair.  I think the problem is I have an EFI parition on my SSD, and by boot is on one of my two HHDs.  I have grub-efi installed, but I can't seem to get it to work.  It complains about unknown filesystem when it boots and goes to recovery.

[05:29] <ussher_> Anyone wise in the ways of pulseaudio?  Yesterday i put fired up an instance of ubuntu studios into virtual box ontop of kubuntu host os.  made about 5 screencast vids, all worked perfectly.  Today I cant get sound to record consistantly.
[06:06] <ussher_> found it.  It was the "Capture Devices" on the host machine had the audio turned down to zero.  guest is working again now.

[07:35] <amichair> I upgraded to KDE 4.11.00 a few days ago, and since then whenever I turn on the second monitor (TV) both screens go blaack and all I see is the mouse cursor. disabling/enabling desktop effects via a keyboard shortcut I added brings things back to normal. Is this a known issue? what component should it be reported on?
[07:36] <dougcan> Hi, I just installed Kubuntu 13.04 on a compaq laptop, i have two problems, one I cannot find a solution to after searching, apparently this is a 13.04 only issue.  How do I set up automatic touchpad disable when I have a mouse plugged in usb?
[07:37] <dougcan> the other problems I think i can figure out later
[07:37] <dougcan> touchpad issue is a biggie right now.  systemsetting doesnt have anything
[07:38] <dougcan> I do have kde-config-touchpad installed
[07:38] <dougcan> but it apparently doesn;t work
[07:38] <dougcan> supposed to have a panel wiget, but could not find it
[07:40] <dougcan> amichair, what videocard do you have?
[07:40] <amichair> an old nvidia
[07:40] <dougcan> it's a driver issue, you can try installing the non-free nvidia driver, or better, get a newer card
[07:41] <dougcan> since the new xorg change, a lot of older drivers got broken
[07:41] <dougcan> forcing many of us to get a newer card
[07:41] <amichair> dougcan: I'm using the proprietary driver last time I checked
[07:41] <dougcan> I went through this in a dual monitor setup
[07:42] <dougcan> what model is your nvidia?
[07:42] <amichair> dougcan: and it's an onboard 9300, no external card
[07:43] <amichair> nvidia driver 304.88 is what the nvidia settings dialog says
[07:44] <dougcan> amichair, I'm using a geforce 7950 card and it works in a dual monitors setup,  and using proprietary driver
[07:45] <amichair> mine worked perfectly for a long time, just started getting blanks a few days ago, and also updated to kde 4.11 a few days ago, I thought it was related. Maybe there was also some driver update I didn't notice at the same time.
[07:46] <dougcan> 304.88 is still beta, you may need to roll back to version 173-update
[07:46] <dougcan> what happen is that Xorg recently made some majorchanges and broke a lot of drivers as a result
[07:47] <amichair> dougcan: interesting, I haven't messed with drivers for years, it's just updating automatically
[07:47] <dougcan> in the setting panel theres a driver icon, click on that and see what options you have
[07:49] <amichair> dougcan: I don't see it in system settings, but can run it manually from k menu search, 'Additional Drivers', is that what you meant?
[07:49] <dougcan> yes that's it
[07:51] <amichair> dougcan: there's nvidia_304 maked with green but says it's activated but not currently in use, and has no description
[07:51] <dougcan> is there any other driverd listed as well?
[07:52] <dougcan> drivers
[07:52] <dougcan> should be a 173-update listed in there
[07:53] <amichair> dougcan: yep, the version appears only in a link in the description: 304-updates,  313-updates, 310-updates, 310, 173, glx
[07:55] <dougcan> okay, you have a newer card than mine :D so try the 319, then 313 and so on, if they don't work, use 173 although it mostly support older cards
[07:55] <dougcan> 310, not 319
[07:57] <dougcan> alas you'll have to reboot, and lose connection here.  since no one replied to y question, I'll be signing off and hit the sack, but if you want me to wait I will
[07:57] <dougcan> y=my
[07:57] <amichair> nah I'll play around, try a few of them - what are the -updates ones?
[07:58] <dougcan> newer and bug fixed of the normal drivers
[07:58] <dougcan> fixes
[07:58] <dougcan> im getting tired my typing is horrible
[07:58] <amichair> ok, I'll try, thanks dougcan!
[07:58] <dougcan> no problem, you're welcome.

[08:54] <harshadura> hi all, im getting weird error while installing Kubuntu 12.04.2 LTS version.
[08:54] <harshadura> this is the error stacktrace: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5995519/
[08:55] <harshadura> basically it says : some keyboard layout issue,
[08:56] <harshadura> can anyone help me, thanks
[09:32] <harshadura> hi Ab3L
[09:39] <not_found> question: What is the major difference running Kubuntu 12.04 with the backports PPA enabled vs say 13.04 with backports enabled, don't you end up running the same version of KDE etc?
[10:25] <Kalidarn> has anyone noticed a weird regression where when you rightclick on a file and alter the "Application preference order" that the changes aren't saved?
[10:25] <Kalidarn> (using latest KDE from the kubuntu PPA)
[10:26] <Kalidarn> ie 4.11
[10:26] <Kalidarn> i noticed this bug occured straight after the update
[10:27] <Kalidarn> also it reset all my preferences, for example I preferred to use QVim over Qt Creator for editing .cpp files, but now Qt Creator is first in the Application Preference Order
[10:27] <Kalidarn> reminds me of an annoying bug that plagued filevault users in MacOSX for ages ;)
[10:33] <infrid> hi
[10:34] <Kalidarn> thanks for solving that shadeslayer https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321706 :)
[10:34] <ubottu> KDE bug 321706 in kcm_filetypes "Some file type association can't be changed anymore" [Major,Confirmed]
[10:34] <shadeslayer> np
[12:43] <not_found> asked some time ago but no luck so let me try again :) - what is the difference between running Kubuntu 12.04 with the backports enabled vs 13.04 also with backports enabled? You get the latest KDE with both, is it the kernel and same other base system files that remain different or do they also get updated?
[12:45] <smartboyhw> not_found: No kernel updates, it's the same...
[12:47] <not_found> smartboyhw: so typically 12.04 is now on 3.2.x and 13.04 on 3.8/9.x ...? if so then thanks for clarifying (still pretty awesome how fast Kubuntu gets the latest versions of KDE SC :D )

[13:54] <ladylee> smartboy why is that the updates spoil the actual distro?
[13:56] <smartboyhw_> ladylee: What?
[13:59] <ladylee> i updated kubuntu LTS after installing in the hopes of getting good fixes
[13:59] <ladylee> but it literally ruined the OS
[13:59] <ladylee> why is that the system esp that has lTS get such updates :S
[14:00] <smartboyhw_> ladylee: What updates?
[14:01] <smartboyhw_> ladylee: Didn't you install 13.04?

[16:47] <boringntp> hello, how can i stop ntp from running? i stopped the service with sudo service ntp stop, but after reboot it's running again, and even when i don't reboot, it starts again on its own a few hours after i turn it off; i tried the solutions in this thread http://askubuntu.com/questions/29663/how-do-i-disable-ntpd but they didn't help
=== maciek_ is now known as Guest45755

[17:10] <NanduX> boringntp 'sudo -s' and then 'echo manual > /etc/init/ntp.override'
[17:10] <NanduX> if that doen't work, use update-rc.d -f ntp remove
[17:11] <boringntp> NanduX: i already tried the update-rc.d solution, it didn't work
[17:13] <dougl> question for an experienced digikam user... when viewing the map with thumnail representing group of pics how do you view or select that group?
[17:14] <NanduX> boringntp take a look if there's some cron job launching the service again
[17:17] <dbc254> little printer problem. Running 12.04 and my printer is a Samsung ML-2010
[17:17] <boringntp> NanduX: there is "ntp": http://paste.ubuntu.com/5996793/ in /etc/cron.daily
[17:18] <dbc254> Prints just fine, but the paper gets stuck in the printer the last 1/2". I pull it free and printing is just fine. Unjam the printer by opening/closing a door and it feeds a sheet to "clear the jam"
[17:19] <dbc254> It's almost as if the paper size is wrong. Trouble finding a new driver. I'm hoping that's all it is???
[17:22] <NanduX> boringntp nope, that script is just rotating logs... I don't know what else could be starting a service

[19:38] <quarky> I don't have any decoration anymore since upgrade from 4.10 to 4.11 on kubuntu 13.04. So I can't resize any windows and I don't have any titlebar. I used the kubuntu backport ppa. I tried to remove my .kde but it didn't solve the problem. I also try to use the proprietary drivers (nvidia) without any change. I also try to disable transparancy and all desktop effects. I still experience the same problem and haven't find any more solution
[19:38] <quarky>  to try. Thanks for any help.
[19:45] <BluesKaj> quarky, have you run an upgrade since or even a dist-upgrade ?
[19:51] <quarky> Yes I have run an update + upgrade few minutes ago but not a dist-upgrade but I am using last kubuntu version
[19:53] <BluesKaj> dist-upgrade doesn't upgrade to a new release , it upgrades your existing packages on the present OS only , quarky
[19:58] <quarky> ok sorry for that. I am doing a dist-upgrade right now. I hope it will solve the problem. I will give you feedbacks when done (~40min with my slow connection).

[22:09] <shadowbroker> so ever since switching to kubuntu, my .bash_profile no longer works. i've lived with this for months now (mostly because i was being lazy) and I even upgraded to ubuntu 13.04, but the problem still exists
[22:10] <shadowbroker> any idea why this could be?
[22:11] <slatenails> i just got notice that a new version of kubuntu is available
[22:11] <slatenails> unless every calendar ever is lying to me 13.10 can't be out yet
[22:12] <NanduX> it's the alpha version
[22:12] <NanduX> alpha2
[22:12] <slatenails> i see
[22:12] <slatenails> that is strange though, i have raring all across /etc/apt/sources.list
[22:14] <Unit193> slatenails: What does /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades have in it?
[22:14] <NanduX> the notice is just the update-notifier, IIRC there was an option for it to show a notice when a new dev version was available

[22:34] <aries1200> hello, why kubuntu and not ubuntu?
[22:35] <shadowbroker> are you using unity?
[22:36] <aries1200> i'm using mageia
[22:36] <aries1200> do you know mageia distro?
[22:37] <shadowbroker> unfortunately, no. but the reason i switched to kubuntu is because unity is absolutely horrid :P
[22:40] <JMichaelX> kubuntu is not accepting changes to file type options, it seems

[22:42] <JMichaelX> many thanks, yofel
[22:42] <shadowbroker> hm. added 'source ~/.bash_profile' to .xprofile, but it still doesn't work
[22:44] <shadowbroker> so i'm using rsync in .bash_profile
[22:45] <shadowbroker> is it possible the location i'm referring to hasnt finished mounting yet?
[22:45] <shadowbroker> (both source and destination are different HDDs)
[22:45] <yofel> what's .xprofile ? ~/.profile should be read on login, but I never heard of .xprofile
[22:46] <aries1200> somebody know mageia?
[22:46] <shadowbroker> some people online were suggesting .xprofile because it has to do with graphical login?
[22:46] <shadowbroker> i'll try .profile i guess
[22:46] <shadowbroker> i just dont get why .bash_profile isn't being loaded instead of .profile
[22:47] <shadowbroker> man bash clearly states that .bash_profile is read first :/
[22:47] <yofel> it should read it on login, yeah
[22:48] <shadowbroker> it doesnt though. rsync is never being run. i dont get why
[23:02] <shadowbroker> sourcing .bash_profile from .profile doesnt work either
[23:16] <Micheal_> Hello I need a hand with using scp and smb together
[23:20] <GiGaHuRtZ> Micheal_: elaborate a bit?
[23:21] <GiGaHuRtZ> usually one uses sftp (scp/ssh dir sharing) or smb
[23:21] <Micheal_> well need to know how to set it up scp /home/folder smb:/NAS/Folder
[23:23] <GiGaHuRtZ> hmm, generally I would mount the smb folder
[23:23] <GiGaHuRtZ> using cifs or smbfs
[23:23] <GiGaHuRtZ> is the smb password protected etc?
[23:24] <GiGaHuRtZ> what you are trying to do is kind of pointless
[23:24] <GiGaHuRtZ> if you have smb access, use smb
[23:24] <GiGaHuRtZ> if you have ssh access, use scp
[23:24] <GiGaHuRtZ> not both
[23:25] <Micheal_> the NAS that I am coping to doesnt have scp access... I cant login to it on a command line
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> Ok, so setup an cifs or smbfs
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> and just copy it that way
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> you can scp if it does have ssh/scp
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> !wiki smbfs
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> ubottu: wiki smbfs
[23:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> i have no idea how ubottu works lmao

[23:27] <GiGaHuRtZ> weird i alllowed it to msg me now, and its not
[23:28] <GiGaHuRtZ> !wiki smbfs
[23:28] <GiGaHuRtZ> Micheal_: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountWindowsSharesPermanently
[23:29] <GiGaHuRtZ> Micheal_: what is the NAS running?
[23:29] <GiGaHuRtZ> linux? windows?
[23:30] <GiGaHuRtZ> that wiki should walk you through it
[23:30] <GiGaHuRtZ> but scping to a smb share will not work for sure :P
[23:30] <GiGaHuRtZ> especially since the box doesnt support scp/ssh
[23:30] <shadowbroker> man. kinda hoped the update might allow .bash_profile to load. nope!
[23:30] <GiGaHuRtZ> shadowbroker: whats the issue?
[23:31] <GiGaHuRtZ> im a zsh kinda guy as of last week (so much more powerful I didnt know what i was missing all these years)
[23:31] <shadowbroker> .bash_profile, .profile, .xprofile... none of them load when i login
[23:31] <GiGaHuRtZ> but i might be able to help
[23:31] <GiGaHuRtZ> shadowbroker: thats simple
[23:31] <GiGaHuRtZ> edit ~/.bashrc
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> put source .bash_profile
[23:32] <shadowbroker> but .bashrc is per-shell
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> per user
[23:32] <shadowbroker> i dont want my backup script running everytime i open up a new terminal :P
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> not per shell
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> then you need to script it correctly
[23:32] <GiGaHuRtZ> ask in #bash
[23:33] <shadowbroker> :/
