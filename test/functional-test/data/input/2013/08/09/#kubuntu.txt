[02:40] <Ensifolk> Hello there. After my very humble experience with Linux - I have decided to stick with KDE as my main Desktop Enviroment, I like it the most and this eye-candy package makes it up for me with excellent features. But I have no idea on which Distro to settle with. I have no clue about the difference between a KDE with Debian/Arch/Gentoo, or what's the difference, or what should make up my
[02:40] <Ensifolk> decision. A mate just adviced me to start with Kubuntu since I am a total newbie. I was checking Chakra, I even tried Linux Mint, but yet Im lost on which to settle ? My next question is : Do ALL Kde distros have the same dekstop features? ( Such as hot corners and all the efects...etc ) - Any major advice for a newbie would be appreciated :) Thank you.

[05:31] <noaXess> morning
[05:31] <noaXess> bad friday :( mysql-server-5.5 update can't be finished: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965085/
[05:31] <noaXess> any hint?
[05:31] <rjdohnert_> reload your repositories
[05:31] <rjdohnert_> sudo apt-get update
[05:33] <noaXess> rjdohnert_: ok.. can it have to do with that? W: GPG error: http://download.virtualbox.org raring Release: The following signatures were invalid: BADSIG 54422A4B98AB5139 Oracle Corporation (VirtualBox archive signing key) <info@virtualbox.org>
[05:33] <noaXess> i already removed the key file and readded it.. same problem
[05:34] <rjdohnert_> No, the missing key has nothing to do with that
[05:34] <noaXess> hm.. any other hint?
[05:35] <rjdohnert_> Another option is to open Muon Package manager, click on settings, configure software sources
[05:35] <rjdohnert_> And go to Server from the United States or main server
[05:36] <rjdohnert_> choose whichever one thats not your default
[05:36] <rjdohnert_> and reload
[05:37] <noaXess> rjdohnert_: you mean instead of download from switzerland.. download from main server..
[05:37] <rjdohnert_> Yes
[05:38] <noaXess> rjdohnert_: no change :(
[05:38] <rjdohnert_> hmmmm now thats odd

[05:44] <rjdohnert_> See if the US server can get it for you
[05:44] <noaXess> wait.. seams i could purge mysql-server-5.5
[05:44] <noaXess> nothing to do with source list i think
[05:45] <rjdohnert_> What release are you running?
[05:45] <rjdohnert_> 1204 1304?
[05:45] <noaXess> raring
[05:46] <noaXess> fu.. same problem after purge and reinstall..

[05:48] <noaXess> read this: http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?11,577216,577216
[05:49] <rjdohnert_> ok you can try that
[05:49] <noaXess> what??
[05:50] <rjdohnert_> Download the deb files and install manually
[05:50] <noaXess> aha..
[05:50] <noaXess> but can't be..
[05:52] <rjdohnert_> Just an idea
[06:00] <dixoncx_> Dolphine doesn't allow me to mount drives.. Error: "An error occurred while accessing 'DATA', the system responded: An unspecified error has occurred.: Authentication is required"

[06:10] <noaXess> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965187/
[06:13] <noaXess> there is a solution to purge also mysql-common, but that does purge this too: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965198/
[06:13] <noaXess> a lot of system packages will be purged..
[06:13] <noaXess> removed
[06:13] <rjdohnert_> Download the packages  manually
[06:13] <valorie> noaXess: have you tried apt-get install mysql-server^
[06:14] <rjdohnert_> From the mysql site
[06:14] <rjdohnert_> He said he did valorie
[06:14] <noaXess> valorie: yes.. purged only mysql-server-5.5 and installed it again.. same probelm.. moved /var/lib/mysql and /etc/mysql/my.cnf, still same problem
[06:16] <valorie> and you set the root password as instructed?
[06:17] <noaXess> mysqllog if i install mysql-server: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965210/

[06:18] <valorie> I'd consult with #ubuntu-devel rather than here
[06:19] <valorie> since I doubt we package mysql
[06:19] <valorie> that is no KDE package
[06:21] <noaXess> there seams to be a solution to purge also mysql-common, but that purges a lot of kde-workspace packages..
[06:22] <valorie> yeah, I saw that
[06:29] <noaXess> more information after purging mysql-server-5.5 and remove /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql and reinstall mysql-server: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965242/

[06:30] <valorie> noaXess: have you asked in #ubuntu-devel ?
[06:37] <valorie> noaXess: googling on parts of your errors convinces me more that this is not an kubuntu error at all
[06:46] <valorie> ok, time to sit down the The Doctor
[06:46] <rjdohnert_> Have fun
[06:49] <noaXess> valorie: yes asked in ubuntu-devel

[11:03] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[11:20] <OerHeks> After a reinstall, one month ago, i have the time bug again in Kubuntu.
[11:21] <OerHeks> i suspect some sort of malware.
[11:22] <OerHeks> please do not tell me it is not possible, as i am sure there is somethiong wrong as it ran fine for a month.
[11:24] <hateball> OerHeks: What time bug?
[11:24] <OerHeks> after boot my time is -2 hours off
[11:24] <OerHeks> there is a known bug, but after reinstall my install went fine for a month or so.
[11:25] <hateball> OerHeks: Is it a single install or dual boot?
[11:25] <OerHeks> single
[11:25] <BluesKaj> OerHeks, well I quit using the the time servers a while back , I found them unreliable or perhaps it's abug , but not using them has solved my issue
[11:25] <hateball> Oh...
[11:25] <OerHeks> there has never been any other OS on this machine
[11:26] <OerHeks> Disabling time sync is not what i want to do, i really suspect something else.
[11:27] <hateball> OerHeks: since you have googled around, I assume you have seen for instance this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1946866&p=11793120#post11793120
[11:27] <BluesKaj> it's not sync it's the network server , my machine time sysns just fine
[11:27] <BluesKaj> syncs
[11:28] <hateball> BluesKaj: Well you can always sync to another pool, if one seems to be off
[11:28] <OerHeks> Yes, i checked the bios time and timezone setting
[11:28] <BluesKaj> mine is fine , hateball
[11:28] <hateball> OerHeks: Ok, I was thinking BIOS maybe wasnt saving it as UTC properly
[11:29] <hateball> assuming you use UTC in both BIOS and OS :p
[11:34] <OerHeks> As far as i can look back, last install was on 5-20-2013, found this issue > http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2140873
[11:35] <OerHeks> There was no update recently, for ntp and such ?
[11:40] <hateball> OerHeks: I don't think so. So your problem is the same then? That hwclock stays sane, while the OS clock drifts?
[11:40] <OerHeks> Yes, bios time is oke, and OS clock is off by -2 hours
[11:41] <hateball> OerHeks: The OS clock as in `date` or some KDE plasmoid that shows time?
[11:42] <OerHeks> Standard date widget on the bottom panel
[11:42] <OerHeks> I have no PPA or backports enabled, and such
[11:43] <hateball> OerHeks: if you run "date" in a terminal, does it show bios time or the plasmoid time?
[11:45] <OerHeks> i had to change the os time to make sure, date shows os time.
[11:46] <hateball> And your timezone is set properly?
[11:46] <OerHeks> Yes, as far as i know, it is set to amsterdam
[11:46] <_none_> 0hai
[11:47] <_none_> YTF does Dolphin have the feature of turning into an Orthodox file manager?
[11:47] <OerHeks> And "set time and date automaticly"  is not selected. i get an error when i want to selct it.
[11:47] <hateball> OerHeks: so that should be UTC+2 then (I'm in Sweden, should be the same)
[11:48] <OerHeks> hateball correct
[11:48] <hateball> OerHeks: is your system locale set to dutch or english?
[11:49] <_none_> Hide all sidebars, hit F3 (show another panel) and F4 (terminal) - and Dolphin becomes a Commander-like file manager.
[11:50] <_none_> Why did Dolphin devs make it able to turn into an OFM?
[11:50] <OerHeks> English > http://paste.kde.org/p5070a7b8/
[11:51] <hateball> I recall some shitty annoyances with regards to this !
[11:51] <OerHeks> menu's are english, as that is what i want
[11:51] <hateball> OerHeks: If you krunner -> language, is it all set to english?
[11:51] <OerHeks> hateball it happened over night, so i an worried
[11:51] <hateball> OerHeks: as in, the country
[11:51] <hateball> OerHeks: oh hmmm
[11:52] <_none_> Locale is best kept as English if you're fluent enough, you end up with half-translated krap otherwise
[11:52] <OerHeks> language is set to american/english
[11:52] <hateball> OerHeks: I mean the regional settings, not "system language"
[11:54] <OerHeks> yes, country/ region & language = American / English
[11:54] <hateball> Yes, that'll mess up the clock then iirc
[11:54] <hateball> You'd probably want to keep the region as Holland but language as English
[11:55] <_none_> That will NOT mess the clock, the clock is set based on phys location
[11:55] <OerHeks> oke, but why does this happpen now, as it is set for weeks ?
[11:56] <_none_> and do NOT go with automated timesetting
[11:56] <_none_> It's recommended to do the installation via Text Mode
[11:56] <OerHeks> _none_, "set time and date automaticly"  is not selected. i get an error when i want to selct it.
[11:57] <_none_> Should've done the install via text mode
[11:58] <_none_> Don't use live-session guided setup
[11:58] <hateball> not sure if serious
[11:58] <_none_> Serious
[11:59] <_none_> It's sufficiently easy, as it's not full text mode, but a "TUI" guided install
[11:59] <hateball> OerHeks: Anyhow, I've had some issues in the past if the regional settings are something like UK, and the clock plasmoid is set to Sweden, it'd still show UK
[11:59] <_none_> The desktop-based guided install is wonky in all Ub editions
[12:00] <hateball> But since there is some idea about reinstalling in text mode I'll do something else for a bit :)
[12:00] <_none_> Text installer tries to pick phys location by IP
[12:00] <OerHeks> hateball, _none_ what to do, i set region to netherlands, shall i reboot to see what happens, and if the tie is set -2 hrs off, file a bugreport?
[12:01] <OerHeks> c/tie/time
[12:01] <hateball> OerHeks: You need to restart the kde session iirc, but if that doesnt help I dunno
[12:01] <hateball> OerHeks: or reboot, sure
[12:01] <OerHeks> oke, brb
[12:02] <_none_> Also, you can install headless Ubuntu via text mode from any Ubuntu LiveCD
[12:03] <floown> hello
[12:03] <_none_> But why did Dolphin devs make it able to turn into an OFM?
[12:03] <floown> I can not do my upgrade, I have this error : http://paste.ubuntu.com/5966001/
[12:04] <floown> what's the problem please?
[12:04] <OerHeks> so, again, time is set -2 hours off
[12:05] <BluesKaj> floown, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[12:06] <hateball> OerHeks: I'm guessing the time stays the same tho, until you manually set it with your now proper locale... but failing that I don't really know
[12:06] <_none_> Also, OerHeks, your system may have suddenly thought hardware is UTC while it isn't, or the other way 'round
[12:06] <hateball> hwclock shows correctly _none_
[12:06] <floown> BluesKaj: I have this error when I update and upgrade
[12:07] <_none_> It may think your hardware is UTC
[12:07] <_none_> Your hwclock is set to local but Ku thinks it's UTC
[12:07] <_none_> this is the bricker
[12:08] <OerHeks> hmm i am going to check the bios again
[12:08] <BluesKaj> floown, looks like you have mysql dependency problems , do , sudo apt-get -f install
[12:09] <_none_> Some ppl go as far as to have a physical clock on the computer for hardware date/time
[12:10] <BluesKaj> floown, and , sudo dpkg --configure -a
[12:11] <floown> BluesKaj: the two lines does not work better
[12:12] <OerHeks> Now my bios time was set -2 hours off, and OS/plug & play is set off ( as i selected it) .. very strange
[12:12] <BluesKaj> floown, are you running kmail and nepomuk ?
[12:13] <_none_> ALWAYS make sure to know if your HW clock is local or UTC before installing.
[12:13] <_none_> r.r
[12:13] <_none_> HWclock may go boogers if you have hardware/battery failures
[12:15] <_none_> ALWAYS check hwclock. If you use a desktop, may want to add a physical on-box clock showing HWclock time
[12:15] <OerHeks> HWclock should not be altered, with OS/plug & play disabled, right?
[12:15] <_none_> It's just that sometimes having hwclock on utc may be required by net-admins and such
[12:16] <_none_> So set hwclock to local and reinstall in text mode, being SURE to pick "local" when asked
[12:16] <_none_> Radical measure, but... those hooks may go deep into firmware, so IDK what Ub does about it
[12:16] <hateball> OerHeks: have you tried forcing it, like setting time properly, and then hwclock --utc --systohc ?
[12:17] <_none_> I'm not that experienced, but I know that those hooks may go verrry deep
[12:18] <BluesKaj> _none_, if you are speaking someone in particular . pleasae use that person's nick
[12:18] <floown> BluesKaj: yes I run kmail and nepomuk
[12:19] <_none_> OerHeks: The hardware hooks are something awkward. Of all Linux distros, best experience is FD64 - and no poppin' timehooks
[12:20] <BluesKaj> floown, ok , shut down the akonadi server and nepomuk , the try the upgrade again
[12:20]  * _none_ is a mean, nearly mindless, obese gamer.
[12:23]  * _none_ despises himself
[12:24] <BluesKaj> _none_, this isn't a true confessions chat , it's kubuntu support :)
[12:24] <_none_> This is just so you understand my standpoint
[12:25] <_none_> Not only that I hate myself, the machine spirit hates me too. Else I'd not have turned to Linux
[12:26] <_none_> Kubuntu proved too messy for me
[12:26] <hateball> !ot
[12:26] <ubottu> #kubuntu is the official Kubuntu support channel, for all Kubuntu-related support questions. Please use #kubuntu-offtopic for general chatter. Thanks!
[12:26] <BluesKaj> _none_, that's not necessary , that's enough
[12:27] <_none_> Why does Kubuntu include Dolphin instead of Rox-filer and Midnight Commander?
[12:27] <_none_> Combining OFM and regular file managers in one bloated thingy is awkward
[12:27] <floown> BluesKaj: how can I stop them ?
[12:28] <_none_> From my standpoint, KDE is messy and has too many unnecessary effects
[12:29] <OerHeks> _none_, that is why i am willing to file a bugreport, to help KDE and others. But i need to make sure, i am not doing something wrong.
[12:30] <_none_> OerHeks: Seems you _are_ doing something wrong, telling wrong time margin between hwclocki and actual timing
[12:30] <BluesKaj> floown, open the kmenu and type akonadi , and nepomuk can be stopped in system settings
[12:30] <_none_> so just reisntall with all things correct, and run along
[12:31] <OerHeks> _none_, oke, if that is true, why does the time went off -2 hrs today, and not a reboot/few reboots ago?
[12:31] <_none_> Battery fault or something
[12:32] <_none_> All in all, Fatdog64 is least awkward when it comes to time, it has no timehooks
[12:33] <_none_> If it's a bug then in firmware, not in Linux/KDE
[12:33] <_none_> or a hardware fault leading to broken configs
[12:34] <floown> BluesKaj: the problem is the same
[12:37] <dragu_> Hi, my today update crashed mysql-server http://pastebin.com/pPEWy7xM - can anyone help?
[12:39] <floown> dragu_: I have the same problem with my Kubuntu…
[12:39] <dragu_> ; <
[12:44] <OerHeks> oh no, not again. another odd thing. i posted a twitter, twitter is -2 hours off, i reloaded the page, time is correct, but after 10 seconds the message time is -2 hrs off again. time on the panel is correct,....
[12:44]  * OerHeks thinks this is a serious time bug
[12:47] <BluesKaj> floown, dragu_ which kubuntu releases ?
[12:47] <floown> BluesKaj: the last release
[12:48] <floown> raring
[12:48] <BluesKaj> floown, do uname -r in the terminal
[12:48] <floown> 3.8.0-28-generic
[12:48] <floown> BluesKaj:
[12:49] <BluesKaj> ok , now uname -a
[12:52] <BluesKaj> floown, then lsb_release -r
[12:54] <floown> uname -a
[12:54] <floown> Linux bibliotheca 3.8.0-28-generic #41-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 26 16:26:01 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[12:54] <floown> lsb_release -r
[12:54] <floown> Release:        13.04
[12:54] <floown> BluesKaj:
[12:57] <OerHeks> Bios set oke, OS time set oke, twitter messages -2 hrs off ... this time issue is making me mad.
[12:57] <OerHeks> :-(
[13:00] <dragu_> @BluesKaj same like floown
[13:00] <OerHeks> hateball, i am looking at this post > http://www.kubuntuforums.net/archive/index.php/t-45194.html > and i see /etc/default/rcS  UTC=yes
[13:02] <grnt> Can anyone help me with plasma theming?
[13:05] <OerHeks> after running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata" my local time is +2 hrs and universal time is correct/same as my real local time :-(
[13:05] <OerHeks> so my panel-clock is showing  universal time
[13:11] <floown> BluesKaj: another idea ?
[13:35] <BluesKaj> had to check 13.04 for mysql dependency probs , none here.

[14:42] <jelyd0nut> So..  say you are trying to compile rapidsvn, and everytime you run, it wants a library file that ends in ".1".  Yet in my /usr/lib, they are all ".0".  Tried uninstalling subversion and reinstalling.. no difference..
[14:43] <Pici> jelyd0nut: Are you aware that rapidsvn is in the repositores?
[14:44] <jelyd0nut> I had to compile by hand as the lastest subversion doesn't work with the .deb available
[14:47] <jelyd0nut> long story short, it was working last week until I broke my cross compile chain.. fixed that, but rapidsvn just won't run.. even tried ln -s the files, and it just segfaults.. unsure of how I can get the proper .1 files to shut it up
[15:04] <BluesKaj> jelyd0nut, would git be an alternative for what you need ?
[15:22] <jelyd0nut> BluesKaj, not really.. I just need a simple gui to check in source, which has been working.. just have no idea how I get these new .1 library files
[15:24] <BluesKaj> jelyd0nut, svn repos update perhaps ?
[15:25] <jelyd0nut> BluesKaj, im not sure what you mean
=== marcel__ is now known as Prof_Teku
[15:28] <BluesKaj> jelyd0nut, wondering if your svn version repository needs updating , altho I'm not real familair with it. I use git because I found it easier
[15:31] <jelyd0nut> svn itself works fine.. it's rapidsvn that doesn't work
[15:32] <BluesKaj> jelyd0nut, run svn up in the terminal
[15:32] <jelyd0nut> it updated...
[15:33] <jelyd0nut> it's when i run rapidsvn gui, is when it wants lib files that end in .2 where all my libs are .1
[15:38] <BluesKaj> jelyd0nut, well dependency conflicts happen wirh most repos even stable ones like svn , but I'm afraid I don't know how to help
[15:38] <jelyd0nut> BluesKaj,
[15:38] <jelyd0nut> BluesKaj, I appreciate your help though! :o)
[15:39] <BluesKaj> I'm sort of bleeding edge but I stick to new OS releases like 13.10 etc
[15:40] <BluesKaj> being a home user I can indulge myself :)
[15:41] <jelyd0nut> yah.. im at work banging my head while I wait on the contract guy to show up as he may know..

[15:46] <BluesKaj> jelyd0nut, 12.04LTS ?
[15:58] <jelyd0nut> BluesKaj, 10.04.4 LTS
[15:59] <BluesKaj> aha
[16:01] <BluesKaj> !10.04LTS
[16:02] <BluesKaj> hmm
[16:02] <BluesKaj> !10.04 LTS
[16:02] <BluesKaj> ??
[16:03] <jelyd0nut> yup.. it's a older one.. i don't upgrade as its a dev machine for a embedded product
[16:04] <BluesKaj> !lucid
[16:04] <ubottu> Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) was the twelfth release of Ubuntu.  Desktop support ended May 9 2013. Server support continues. See http://ubottu.com/y/lucid for more details.
[16:04] <BluesKaj> jelyd0nut, server edition ?
[16:05] <jelyd0nut> uhhh.. not sure how to tell.. for some reason i doubt it
[16:05] <BluesKaj> kde/kubuntu desktop ?
[16:06] <jelyd0nut> it's kubuntu
[16:06] <BluesKaj> ok
[16:07] <jelyd0nut> had a issue with not have a right click open terminal option when i tried reg ubuntu and all i use is command line, minus 2 proggys
[16:09] <BluesKaj> time to upgrade to 12.04 especially if it's a dev machine for a embedded product, seems svn has left your version behind
[16:11] <BluesKaj> ok , I have to go , good luck jelyd0nut, hope some can help
[16:11] <jelyd0nut> Thanks again.. Have a good one!

[19:47] <GH0> Hello, I am trying to fix certain applications from not showing up in the KDE Menu. I ran "kbuildsycoca4 -noincremental" however, when I do that, it complains about two files that don't appear in the menu to begin with. I checked their package with debsums -sc and it doesn't report anything back. So I was wondering how to go about replacing the files located in /usr/share/applications/
[19:47] <GH0> Is it possible to reinstall them somehow?
[19:48] <GH0> The error is as follows:
[19:48] <GH0> kbuildsycoca4(12617) KConfigGroup::readXdgListEntry: List entry Keywords in "/usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop" is not compliant with XDG standard (missing trailing semicolon).

[20:12] <graft> hi, i'm trying to update from 12.10 to 13.04, but muon updater is broken because of some python/python3 discrepancy, and i can't figure out how to run the updater via a standalone python script by importing the module... i see that there is a patched version of muon updater out there, is there some way to get ahold of this?
[20:14] <graft> also, does kubuntu even live on the main ubuntu servers any more?
=== stefan____ is now known as stefanQuark
[20:26] <yofel> graft: it is on the ubuntu servers. Do you have all updates installed?
[20:26] <graft> yofel: yes
[20:26] <yofel> what's the python issue?
[20:27] <graft> well, in muon update manager, if i click 'upgrade' to upgrade to 13.04, nothing happens
[20:27] <graft> if i run it from the shell, i see this is because it can't find the correct python module, because it's using python instead of python3
[20:28] <graft> seems fixed in this commit: http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-commits&m=136332005527708
[20:28] <graft> but clearly that's not the version of muon update manager i have, and i'm not sure how to get it
[20:29] <yofel> hm, might not have been updated in quantal...
[20:29] <yofel> you can do the upgrade process from konsole with 'sudo do-release-upgrade' instead
[20:30] <graft> aha... neat

[20:47] <exosus> Here's the thing- i installed xfce for kubuntu and whenever i start a pc and then new session in xfce, there's no way to connect to net. I need to start session on KDE then KDE Daemon asks for password to KDEwalletmanager and then it connects to net. Can i do smth about it?
[20:55] <graft> doesn't xfce have some network-manager type interface?
[20:57] <exosus> couldnt find anything in settings manager. Now i found out that you can still see KDE settings while in xfce
[20:59] <exosus> When i am in KDE i use this widget Network Manager, but i dont know where is it in the settings
[21:05] <exosus> there's Network Settings in KDE's System Settings. Yet i cannot find a way to connect with this
[21:12] <graft> i would leave the kde stuff alone in xfce, that sounds like a bad idea to mix systems
[21:13] <graft> try wicd maybe?
[21:14] <exosus> i will look into it
[21:25] <zubzub_> hey
