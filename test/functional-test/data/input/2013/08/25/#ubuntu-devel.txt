[06:11] <ESphynx> hey guys, anybody aware of a bug effectively looking like you're looking at the back buffer?
[06:23] <RAOF> ESphynx: Got some context? :))
[06:34] <ESphynx> RAOF: hi
[06:34] <ESphynx> basically, our toolkit is rendering to a pixmap and then right away doing a XCopyArea() to the Xlib window to update the screen
[06:34] <ESphynx> I end up where pressing up highlights a selection down, and pressing down highlights a seleciton up sometimes...
[06:37] <ESphynx> It's on and off and very strange! As much as I would like to think it's a bug in our toolkit and fix it, I've never ran into this before running Saucy on this new laptop... (nVidia drivers)
[06:43] <RAOF> Hm. How are you rendering to the pixmap?
[06:43] <ESphynx> Xlib / XRender calls
[06:44] <ESphynx> For some reason I used to do an XFlush right after the XCopyArea(), it's still there...
[06:45] <RAOF> You're not doing something strange with threads?
[06:45] <ESphynx> The toolkit is using threads to handle events...
[06:45] <RAOF> AFAIK the X protocol ensures that your rendering should be done before XCopyArea kicks in.
[06:46] <ESphynx> I would think so, since both the pixmap and window are server side objects, right?
[06:46] <ESphynx> I had even tried an XFlush() before the XCopyArea, I thought that helped, but in the end the problem still happened
[06:47] <ESphynx> I have one thread doing a select on the X socket
[06:48] <ESphynx> which essentially just wakes up the main thread, which will use XCheckIfEvent()
[06:48] <ESphynx> I would suspect a display driver issue or something?
[06:50] <RAOF> ESphynx: Plausibly.
[06:50] <RAOF> ESphynx: Does it happen under different compositors / no compositor?
[06:51] <ESphynx> well I was in Unity right now
[06:51] <ESphynx> how can I try no compositor
[06:51] <ESphynx> GNOME Flashback (No effects) would that be good/
[06:51] <RAOF> Yeah, I think so.
[06:52] <RAOF> You can also install metacity and run metacity --replace
[06:54] <ESphynx> RAOF: In GNOME FB no fx, haven't been able to reproduce it yet! with quite a fair bit of hammering
[06:55] <ESphynx> (To the detriment of my brand new lappy's poor keyboard :( )
[06:55] <ESphynx> What does that say?
[06:55] <RAOF> That it's possibly a damage issue.
[06:55] <RAOF> (Or a Unity issue â˜º)
[06:56] <ESphynx> I've seen it in GNOME as well
[06:59] <ESphynx> (though not in GNOME classic it would seem)
[07:14] <ESphynx> :S I can't even reproduce it in Unity now!
[07:16] <ESphynx> It might be the new Unity that fixed it? I got a EN showing up now in the title bar
[07:27] <ESphynx> damn all this time I was testing the GL driver :S
[07:28] <ESphynx> definitely get the issue in Unity!
[08:02] <ESphynx> OK I have definitely reproduced it in Gnome Classic as well.
[08:06] <ESphynx> and in Gnome flashback (with fx as well)
[08:08] <ESphynx> that is, only with fx
[08:15] <ESphynx> Strange thing happens on Gnome Flashback with Effects: clicking on close button in top/left corner turns the title bar gray rather than closing the app ... It's basically very messed up. Does this mean it's the compositor? As soon as effects are on, everything is messed up
[08:19] <ESphynx> Without effects, the close button works just fine!
[08:24] <ESphynx> See http://ecere.com/mantis/view.php?id=987 -- exhausted, gonna go get some rest :| keep sleeping well guys :P

[12:34] <GuidoPallemans> are there any guides on how to use the styles? I want to change the background color of all my pages and the foreground color of all my text
[12:50] <GuidoPallemans> put a new app submission on the subreddit, will now post (the same) to g+
[12:56] <Ampelbein> GuidoPallemans: You might be better off asking in #ubuntu-app-devel
[12:56] <GuidoPallemans> hmm yes, maybe :D
