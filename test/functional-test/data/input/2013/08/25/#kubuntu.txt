[15:59] <LogicallyDashing> I occasionally switch between QWERTY and Dvorak keyboard layouts. In most apps, the keyboard shortcuts change to match the new layout. In Kate (and possibly others) this doesn't happen. I want it to. How do I make it happen?
[16:09] <mamoun> Hi, I'm having an odd problem with an old laptop running kubuntu,...
[16:09] <mamoun> ...at boot, the laptop is normally speed, but after a while it beomes seriously sluggish
[16:10] <mamoun> ...apparently the cpu frequency becomes stuck at the lowest possible value (only 600 mhz)
[16:10] <mamoun> no idea why
[16:10] <LogicallyDashing> mamoun, check your power management settings, in the settings manager
[16:11] <mamoun> Thank you for replying, there is no options related to cpu throttle in the power management options
[16:11] <mamoun> using kde 4.10
[16:14] <mamoun> I thought it could be because of overheating, but even using a laptop fan, there is no difference
[16:17] <mamoun> ok, quick unrelated basic question: where does custom grub configuration goes?
[16:18] <mamoun> I remember messing up with it ages ago but now I really can't remember where it was

[17:16] <rodion> привет, народ
[17:39] <seronis> every time I click a weblink in a program (not web browser) it opens Muon software center asking me to install firefox INSTEAD of just opening chrome
[17:39] <seronis> any suggestions on how to fix this ?
[17:44] <LogicallyDashing> seronis, you need to change a thing in Default Applications
[17:44] <LogicallyDashing> to the effect that Chrome is your default web browser
[17:45] <LogicallyDashing> This means you don't get a different app depending on the contents of a web link. You may not care

[20:08] <gizmobay> I'm trying to install kdm on 13.04. When I try, it says it must uninstall kde-full, kde-workspace, etc.. Is this correct?
[20:11] <BluesKaj> gizmobay, lightdm is the default now 
=== joerg is now known as Guest8097
[20:39] <seronis> LogicallyDashing, i set chrome as my default web browser the day i installed kubuntu
[20:40] <seronis> it worked normally and randomly started doing this
[20:41] <LogicallyDashing> seronis, so did you check the way it's set now? settings could have gotten randomly wiped
[20:41] <seronis> yup.  i set it to the kde default web browser and then back to chrome
[20:41] <BluesKaj> seronis, use chromium
[20:41] <seronis> blue, no
[20:42] <seronis> chromium has nothing to do with my issue
[20:42] <BluesKaj> then expalian your issue
[20:42] <seronis> every time I click a weblink in a program (not web browser) it opens Muon software center asking me to install firefox INSTEAD of just opening chrome
[20:43] <BluesKaj> then chrome has everything to do with your issue because chromium is the default version for linux 
[20:44] <seronis> no..  'rekonq'  is default in kubuntu
[20:44] <BluesKaj> default ggogle internet browser for linux , then
[20:45] <seronis> and switching 'default web browser' back to rekonq does not fix issue.  switching to opera or chrome afterwards does not fix issue
[20:45] <BluesKaj> anyway , use chromium , chrome isn't supported here
[20:46] <seronis> i dont give a shit.   my issue isnt chrome.  its  muon software center
[20:46] <seronis> which should not be telling me to install 'firefox' when i click a link
[20:46] <seronis> now.  be helpful or be quiet

[20:47] <seronis> idleone, if he doesnt want to help he doesnt have to. but i asked about a specific issue
[20:47] <BluesKaj> seronis , if you insist that muon is your issue , you;re mistaken , that's all.
[20:47] <IdleOne> seronis: the two factoids were directed at you. 
[20:47] <seronis> idleone,  im aware.  i just disagree
[20:48] <IdleOne> not at BluesKaj All I saw was you cursing and being rude
[20:48] <BluesKaj> !chrome
[20:48] <seronis> blueskaj,  stay on topic
[20:48] <BluesKaj> !info chrome
[20:48] <ubottu> Package chrome does not exist in raring
[20:48] <IdleOne> google chrome is not supported on ubuntu or kubuntu. seek help from google.
[20:48] <seronis> my problem is the same with rekonq
[20:49] <seronis> now..  stop being pendantic
[20:49] <seronis> help or not.  im happy with idling until someone can help
[20:49] <IdleOne> seronis: drop the attitude
[20:50] <seronis> rekonq is supported here.  exact same 'effect' is in play.  
[20:51] <seronis> muon software center should be suported here.  its the issue as far as i can tell.  id appreciate information to the contrary
[20:52] <seronis> idleone, are you able to help tell me why rekonq does not launch when i click a link ?
[20:53] <IdleOne> I'm not interested in helping you.
[20:54] <Fa_1> seronis: is the application you click the link something java based, like minecraft?
[20:54] <seronis> minecraft, steam, and instant messengers
[20:54] <seronis> any link outside a web browser
[20:55] <joephelius> what does update-alternatives --display x-www-browser tell you?
[20:55] <seronis> testing now
[20:56] <BluesKaj> then set a default web browser in system settings.default apps
[20:56] <seronis> blueskaj, i told you i've switched back and forth between rekonq, opera, chrome.  i've uninstalled opera and chromium
[20:56] <seronis> currently its listing chrome as priority 200 and rekonq as priority 40
[20:57] <seronis> @ joephelius
[20:57] <joephelius> does xdg-open http://google.com from a terminal also open muon?
[20:58] <seronis> testing
[20:58] <seronis> nope.  that worked fine actually
[20:59] <BluesKaj> ok , then seronis good luck , despite the attitude 
[20:59] <seronis> blueskaj, appreciaqte the effort.  its just  'use XXX browser instead' isnt helpful. id rather track down why the problem occurs
[21:01] <joephelius> where do you click the links that open muon, by the way?
[21:01] <seronis> in the chat window in minecraft.  in instant message windows in steam and other IM clients
[21:03] <seronis> just tested.  clicking a link here in hexchat opens muon too
[21:05] <joephelius> can you remove muon and try again? what happens then?
[21:06] <seronis> oddly enough..   'sudo apt-get remove muon' 
[21:06] <seronis> and muon still opened clicking a link
=== Guest8097 is now known as LachNed
[21:09] <joephelius> something's definitely not right :D
[21:11] <joephelius> seronis: remove muon-installer, too
[21:12] <joephelius> which should, if installed, remove the kubuntu-firefox-installer, too
[21:12] <Fa_1> it should be enough to remove kubuntu-firefox-installer
[21:12] <joephelius> which I guess is what keeps popping up
[21:15] <seronis> joephelius, problem resolved.  thank you 
[21:17] <joephelius> glad I could help ;)
[21:19] <BluesKaj> one shouldn't have to remove the FF installer, there's something still amiss I think
[21:19] <seronis> agreed.  but doing so fixed the problem
[21:20] <seronis> the only thing i can think that i installed close to when the problem started was netflix desktop package
[21:21] <seronis> but i used that with xubuntu without any issues
[21:22] <joephelius> seems this installer registered somewhere as default url handler
[21:22] <joephelius> but not in xdg-open
[21:22] <joephelius> google found one other person having the problem and no solution except re-installing firefox
[21:23] <seronis> reinstalling and re-removing firefox didnt fix it
[21:23] <seronis> i did try that last week.  probably saw the same goog result you saw
[21:24] <Fa_1> or uninstall kubuntu-firefox-installer.. thats my fix. but my only known app is minecraft
[21:25] <seronis> is there any way to see a list of packages that contain a specific other package as a dependancy /
[21:26] <seronis> ie:  all packages that would have installed kubuntu-firefox-installer
[21:26] <joephelius> apt-get rdepends
[21:26] <joephelius> I guess
[21:27] <seronis> 'invalid operation rdepends'
[21:27] <seronis> or not.  thanks anyways
[21:27] <joephelius> apt-cache
[21:27] <joephelius> sry
[21:28] <joephelius> debian always confuses me with this damned packet manager
[21:28] <seronis> thanks.  im still mostly new to linux.  have 3 months with xfce and now 2 months with kde
[21:29] <seronis> will do some 'man' research on apt-cache
