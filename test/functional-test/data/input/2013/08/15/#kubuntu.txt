[00:11] <bwat47> On a fresh install of kubuntu when running updates in muon it just got stuck indefinitely on "waiting for configuration file" (I assume because the package had a new version of a system config file?) It never prompted me to replace a config file or anything it just say there indefinitely until I closed it and then fixed my packages with dpkg/apt-get
[00:11] <bwat47> Was this some kind of fluke or could this happen anytime a config file needs to be changed when running updates?

[09:18] <tonz> hi folks, i am on unbuntu 12.04 and did an upgrade to kde 4.11 (backports ppa) now it seems there is a problem with the packaging.
[09:19] <tonz> nepomuk does not find virtuoso
[09:19] <tonz> though it runs
[09:19] <tonz> in the logs i saw it complains that it needs at least virtuoso 6.1.6
[09:19] <tonz> but only 6.1.4 is available
[09:20] <tonz> anyone else seeing this problem?

[11:02] <crazyboy> hello ,anyone here?
[11:03] <jussi> bueller? bueller? anyone?
[11:04] <jussi> crazyboy: just ask your question :)
[11:04] <smartboyhw> Riddell, please de-op:P
[11:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, what?
[11:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I'm telling you to de-op yourself:P
[11:05] <Riddell> I was trying to go on a power crazed spree but it didn't work
[11:08] <BluesKaj> Hey folks
[11:18] <tonz_> smartboyhw: ok, with the newest virtuoso package nepomuk starts but viewing emails in kontact seems not to work, it stalls with Mail Filter Agent 0%, akonadiconsole tells me that the akonadi nepomuk feeder is indexing but it does that awfully slow :( do you use kmail?
[11:18] <smartboyhw> tonz_, no unfortunately...
[11:18]  * smartboyhw uses GMail by web browsers;P
[11:19] <tonz_> hm okay, seems not really usable right now. i need to use it here in my company
[11:19] <tonz_> i don't want to use owa :(
[11:20] <tonz_> well, back to thunderbird once more maybe it behaves better after indexing is done
[11:23] <jussi> tonz_: I use Kmail everyday for work - perhaps its worth asking in #kontact
[11:24] <tonz_> jussi: do you use kde 4.11 already?
[11:24] <jussi> tonz_: no, Im on 4.10.5
[11:25] <tonz_> well, it worked for me on 4.10 too
[11:25] <jussi> tonz_: is this only one machine?
[11:25] <tonz_> but today i accidentally upgraded to 4.11
[11:25] <tonz_> yes, i am using my laptop
[11:26] <jussi> tonz_: one thing that may help, but is a little work, would be to delete and re-add the account. there _may_ be an upgrade issue.
[11:26] <tonz_> ok, i will try
[11:26] <tonz_> but kontact doesnt even start after first try
[11:26] <tonz_> i have to start it, kill it and start it again
[11:28] <jussi> tonz_: yeah, I actually had a similar issue after an upgrade sometime ago and that was the advice given to me
[11:47] <tonz_> jussi: wow, that seems to have fixed it :) mails reappeared and i can now actually read em
[11:47] <tonz_> thx ;)
[11:47] <jussi> tonz_: yw, glad it worked
[11:58] <tonz_> damn, receiving works now but not sending :( oh boy i hate it
[12:00] <linuxabc> Where does kmail keep the e-mails?
[12:01] <linuxabc> my /.kde/share/apps/kmail/mail is empty
[12:01] <linuxabc> in fact I don't have such directory
[12:02] <jussi> tonz_: did you recreate the smtp part ?
[12:03] <tonz_> jussi: yes
[12:03] <tonz_> it doesnt even seem to try it
[12:03] <jussi> tonz_: check the security settings are correct
[12:04] <tonz_> jussi: they are
[12:05] <tonz_> jussi: if not, kmail should give me some error, no?
[12:06] <jussi> tonz_: maybe, maybe not...

[16:05] <tiberiu> hey is there a command to open a terminal very quick
[16:05] <tiberiu> ?
[16:06] <genii> tiberiu: alt-f2 then type in: konsole   and hit return
[16:06] <tiberiu> hmmm let's try
[16:07] <tiberiu> I was thinking of a shortcut which will open an 'instant'  terminal
[16:13] <tiberiu> Skype protocol ... is this normal ? with 64bit you download the binary from skype and when you try to intall it is says  "Wrong architecture i368"
[16:15] <tiberiu> hmm I knew that this will happen :))
[16:15] <tiberiu> always haking with linux, huh?
[16:21] <tiberiu> awww ... can you run i386 programs on 64bits machine ?
[16:22] <BluesKaj> tiberiu, try yakuake , it opensa terminal with f12
[16:23] <[RoeyInABox]> heya BluesKaj
[16:23] <BluesKaj> hi [RoeyInABox]
[16:23] <[RoeyInABox]> BluesKaj:  I updated to the latest KDE release on my Quantal box,
[16:24] <BluesKaj> ok, and ?
[16:24] <[RoeyInABox]> and I noticed that when I push the cursor against the screen edges, they light up but the corresponding Desktop Effect does not show
[16:24] <tiberiu> you mean ctrl+alt+F(whatever)?
[16:24] <[RoeyInABox]> it works for me on my Raring Ringtail laptop though
[16:24] <[RoeyInABox]> tiberiu:  I mapped Present Windows to the bottom edge of the screen
[16:25] <[RoeyInABox]> the bottom edge lights up in blue but Present Windows does not happen
[16:25] <[RoeyInABox]> I can still do it by pressing alt-2 (mapped it to a key)
[16:25] <BluesKaj> tiberiu, you were asking about an instant terminal , then yakuake is what you want
[16:25] <BluesKaj> !yakuake
[16:25] <tiberiu> exactament :)
[16:25] <BluesKaj> !info yakuake
[16:25] <ubottu> yakuake (source: yakuake): a Quake-style terminal emulator based on KDE Konsole technology. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.9.9-0ubuntu1 (raring), package size 337 kB, installed size 2026 kB
[16:25] <tiberiu> danke
[16:26] <BluesKaj> bid
[16:26] <[RoeyInABox]> tiberiu:  yeah yaquake is great because it's available no matter which desktop you're on
[16:26] <tiberiu> exactly what I was looking for, thanks guys!
[16:27] <BluesKaj> I use it almost exclusively , it hides if needed , but the process keeps doing what ever commands you've entered
[16:31] <tiberiu> and now what about frozen windows ? :)) "terminate application " seems to do nothing
[16:31] <[RoeyInABox]> tiberiu:  the guy who made it is nicknamed Sho_  over here btw
[16:32] <tiberiu> RoeyInABox: that cool should I say hi ?
[16:33] <[RoeyInABox]> tiberiu:  sure
[16:33] <[RoeyInABox]> use it a bit
[16:33] <[RoeyInABox]> get a sense for its usefulness
[16:33] <[RoeyInABox]> I mapped it to alt-`
[16:34] <[RoeyInABox]> oh, and I mapped Firefox's Panorama to alt-3
[16:34] <[RoeyInABox]> and I mapped Present WIndows to alt-2
[16:35] <navlelo_> I have tried to update my kubuntu raring install with kde 4.11 from the backports ppa. However, a lot of the packages are marked as manual install. Whats the best way to install these packages?

[18:47] <eliasp> when using the backports PPA for having KDE SC 4.11 on 13.04, krdc doesn't work anymore for RDP connections (The version of "xfreerdp" you are using is too old. xfreerdp 1.0.2 or greater is required.). The backports PPA should probably also provide freerdp-x11-1.0.2, as the standard repository only provides 1.0.1-2ubuntu1
