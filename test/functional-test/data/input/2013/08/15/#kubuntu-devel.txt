[03:45]  * smartboyhw likes his name mentioned on the announcement page:P
[05:50] <Noskcaj> contrast, I was just going to file a sync bug and have smartboyhw fix it
[05:50] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, did you read the irclog for about 8 hours ago?
[06:02] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, !!!?!?!
[06:02] <smartboyhw> What the？
[06:02] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, the ktp packages. they need syncing
[06:02] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, syncing？
[06:03] <smartboyhw> I thought they are uploaded, that is
[06:03] <Noskcaj> from debian
[06:03] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, ah, that's not *syncing*, that's *merging*
[06:03] <smartboyhw> Oh no:(
[06:03] <smartboyhw> Merges take a LONG time.
[06:04] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, isn't it a sync if there are no changes from the debian version?
[06:04] <Noskcaj> The ubuntu delta is irrelevant on most of them
[06:04] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, so, has Debian got the new 0.6.3 ktp version in?
[06:05] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, yep
[06:05] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, well sync it then, if you want
[06:05] <smartboyhw> But please be reminded, I have no sync rights whatsoever
[06:05] <Noskcaj> I'll file some sync bugs tomorrow if you don't get time to look into it. I have soccar training soon
[06:05] <smartboyhw> I'm not yet a Kubuntu dev.
[06:05] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, i know, i was meaning file the bugs
[06:06] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, can't you file the bugs yourself?:P
[06:06] <smartboyhw> It's just as simple as running the syncpackage command from ubuntu-dev-tools...
[06:06] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, i can, it's just there are a lot and you where the one who most recently merged them
[06:06] <smartboyhw> Sigh
[06:07] <Noskcaj> I'll do it, it's just i was hoping you could at least help
[06:07] <smartboyhw> Actually, there's no need for a sync if the packages are the same version anyway
[06:07] <smartboyhw> Especially since you said there are no diff.
[06:09] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, ^
[06:10] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, most have debian changes that help
[06:10] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, that's merging then
[06:11] <Noskcaj> as in, the changes in debian help
[06:11] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, I know
[06:11] <Noskcaj> the debian package is better than the ubuntu package
[06:15] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, OK then
[06:16] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, where are the packages？ unstable or experimental?
[06:16] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, unstable. i found them all on merges.ubuntu.com
[06:18] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, BTW how is it better?
[06:20] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, http://paste.ubuntu.com/5987873/ is the changelog of one
[06:20] <smartboyhw> ：O
[06:23] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, confirm: ALL of them are syncs?
[06:24] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, IDK, i've only had time to test two, i'll check them when i get to them. I can't seem to get requestsync to work. 
[06:24] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, me too:P
[06:33] <Noskcaj> bug 1212556 is the only one i have time to file before i go to soccer
[06:33] <ubottu> bug 1212556 in Ubuntu "Please sync ktp-text-ui (universe) from debian unstable" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1212556
[06:47] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, I just can't simply run the requestsync command, the report editing window doesn't jump up
[06:47] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, ^ can you help a bit?:P
[06:47] <smartboyhw> yofel, ^
[08:21] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, exact same problem here
[08:22] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, hmm
[08:22] <smartboyhw> :(
[08:23] <yofel> smartboyhw: I've got a minue, what are you running? (commandline)
[08:23] <smartboyhw> yofel, requestsync
[08:23] <yofel> *minute
[08:23] <yofel> without parameters? ^^
[08:23] <smartboyhw> requestsync -d unstable ktp-accounts-kcm
[08:23] <smartboyhw> It was Noskcaj's request so that he can put the Debian changes in.
[08:25] <yofel> smartboyhw: http://paste.kde.org/p044a013a ?
[08:25] <yofel> it just took ~20s until it showed up
[08:25] <yofel> LP seems a bit slow
[08:25] <smartboyhw> yofel, yeah
[08:26] <smartboyhw> Well it just doesn't show up for me at all
[08:26] <yofel> you could use --email maybe
[08:26] <yofel> LP does have an email interface after all
[08:26]  * yofel gone again

[11:33] <shadeslayer> yofel: do you know how to setup encryption in kmail>
[11:33] <yofel> same how you setup signing?
[11:33]  * smartboyhw watches this interesting questioning
[11:34] <yofel> only difference is that kmail will ask you to select the key before sending
[11:34] <Riddell> shadeslayer: why do you want to encrypt and sign all your e-mail?
[11:34] <yofel> NSA? ^^
[11:34]  * yofel does now sign all his mails by default
[11:35] <Riddell> do you think anyone who receives it verifies them?
[11:35] <shadeslayer> Riddell: signing because incase my email gets compromised in the future and someone sends an email to my parents asking for money, they can check the sig ... and what yofel said
[11:35] <yofel> nope, but if someone wants to do it they *can* do it now
[11:35] <shadeslayer> ^^
[11:39] <shadeslayer> also gives you deniability
[11:39] <shadeslayer> didn't recieved a signed email from me? not mine
[11:40] <yofel> shadeslayer: btw. I just sent you an encrypted testmail. Haven't tried this for a while myself ^^
[11:40] <shadeslayer> yeah :)
[11:40] <shadeslayer> waiting for kmail to update
[11:40] <shadeslayer> it's so slowwwww

[11:43] <yofel> yep

[12:21] <tester56> hi!, does anyone know in which channel I could get help with apparmor ?
[12:22] <Riddell> now there's something I don't know anything about
[12:22] <Riddell> #ubuntu-security I'd guess
[12:24] <tester56> thanks, I 'll try it
[12:25] <smartboyhw> Riddell, congrats:)
[12:34] <tester56> does not seem quite active
[12:34] <tester56> (ubuntu-security)
[12:35] <smartboyhw> tester56, maybe because the main members of the Ubuntu Security team hasn't woken up yet?
[12:35] <tester56> has anybody here experience with apparmor profiles?
[12:39] <Riddell> smartboyhw: on what?
[12:40] <smartboyhw> Riddell, on having something you don't know about (apparmor)
[12:42] <Riddell> smartboyhw: oh I'm sure there's plenty of those

[12:49] <smartboyhw> jussi, what did you update?
[12:50] <jussi> mrgh, no idea, dont remember? its been ages since I rebooted
[12:50] <smartboyhw> jussi, :O
[12:51] <jussi> smartboyhw: I only really reboot for kernel updates, otherwise, sleep
[12:51]  * smartboyhw thinks that is NOT advisable:P
[12:53] <jussi> smartboyhw: why? 
[12:53] <smartboyhw> jussi, sleep might easily cause your computer to break.
[12:54] <jussi> smartboyhw: mhm? 
[12:54] <smartboyhw> And when some packages REALLY require reboots and you don't, it's not going well....
[12:55] <yofel> almost none do that though. I haven't rebooted for 9 days either (still running 3.10.0-6)
[12:55] <smartboyhw> yofel, eh, run a newer kernel;)
[12:56] <yofel> but I have to reboot to do that ;P
[12:56] <smartboyhw> Sigh, why do you guys HATE reboots?
[12:57] <yofel> because I have to restore the session and type half a dozen passwords on reboot
[12:58] <yofel> I'm too lazy for that usually
[12:58] <smartboyhw> yofel, your fault:P
[12:58] <smartboyhw> Half a dozen
