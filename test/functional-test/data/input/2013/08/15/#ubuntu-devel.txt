[08:49] <mpt> xnox, let me know when you need something for it. :-)
[08:53] <xnox> mpt: i'll hunt down an SSD drive, cause my machine should be able to have this working. 13.10 will have the right kernel, but i'm not sure about the installer bits & user-space toggles. Something for 14.04 I think.
[09:21] <jtaylor> why is skimage not showing up in jenkins? I though of the XS-... this time :(
[09:27] <darkxst> I dropped the -dbg packages from webkit (on our ppa) but now the dbgsym's are broken http://paste.ubuntu.com/5988275/
[09:27] <darkxst> anyone know about this stuff or do I need to wait for pitti to get back?
[09:35] <rbasak> xnox: IIRC, it assumes that your branch is the Debian packaging branch though, rather than being able to import that bit :-/
[09:44] <xnox> rbasak: well, you can start at any time. E.g. import a dsc.
[09:49] <rbasak> xnox: right, but for Ubuntu you need to continuously rebase. I want to use tools like git-rerere to make that easier. Anyway, I do need to look into it more.
[09:50] <rbasak> Also Ubuntu holds the archive as the pristine source for most packages, so any extra information would be lost.
[09:50] <xnox> rbasak: that's how git-dpm works. it's git rebased based workflow.
[09:50] <xnox> rbasak: all patches are commits, and those are rebased onto new releases.
[09:51] <rbasak> I think it'll screw up if some other non-git-dpm-using Ubuntu developer does an intermediate upload.
[10:01] <xnox> rbasak: =/ hm, yeah, i guess one would need to do imports.

[10:11] <tkamppeter> I have uploaded ghostscript 9.06rc1 to saucy-proposed and it did not pass on to saucy. As I chose a bad version number (9.08~rc1~dfsg is considered newer than 9.08~dfsg) can this package get removed and I upload the final instead?

[15:52] <stokachu> rbasak: might as well revert for now until i can get this built and run my tests for it
[16:10] <rbasak> stokachu: thanks. Let me see if a reverted sbuild passes for me. No point uploading if that fails too.
[16:12] <stokachu> rbasak: ok, not all tests fail just about 85 out of the million and 1 that gets run
[16:25] <rbasak> Have we diverged on flash-kernel again? I thought the idea was to keep them synced this time?

[16:33] <mapreri> does someone know if pitti is on holiday or is simply afk (with the computer turned off)?

[16:41] <ogra_> (i'm not sure if he is actually there ... but many of us are this week and it seems likely)
[16:49] <jono> is anyone else in Saucy constantly finding Firefox to hang for periods of time?
[16:50] <ogra_> who uses firefox anyway ...

[16:51] <ogra_> heh

[16:54] <mdeslaur> is this "browser" thing an app I can install on my phone?

[17:02] <asac> jono: ffox is pretty stable as my default browser ... though, i dont use it for google services anymore as those seem to intentionally provide a sucky ffox experience while to market their chrome browser with a banner (old browser, why not use chrome)

=== JZTech101 is now known as JZ|Zzz
[17:03] <ogra_> FF is completely unusable on ARM
[17:03] <ogra_> and since i spend most of my worktime on the chromebook ...
[17:03] <jono> asac, been like this for a few weeks
[17:06] <asac> jono: back in ffox maintainer days i would have asked you to check if disabling all your extensions will improve the situation as a first measure
[17:07] <asac> jono: i assume you tried that?
[17:07] <jono> asac, will try
[17:07] <infinity> jono: If your browser's uptime is high, I'd also just try killing it, restarting, and restoring your session.
[17:07] <jcastro> FF has been solid on saucy here
[17:07] <infinity> jono: Plus, there was an update in saucy recently.  So, knowing that last week's browser was buggy isn't all that handy.
[17:08] <jono> infinity, well this weeks browser is buggy too
[17:08] <jono> :-)

[18:09] <omer> hi, I'm trying to patch a package (first time), and when I run bzr builddeb, it fails with the error "Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected
[18:09] <omer> for file debian/rules
[18:09] <omer> which I changed
[18:10] <omer> and then I get "fuzz is not allowed when applying patches"
[18:10] <omer> any ideas why that could be?
[18:47] <infinity> siretart: Are you ready to make the libav transition happen in Ubuntu?  FF is approaching quickly, and I'd rather not put it off another release cycle.
[18:57] <om26er> mterry, are you online ?

[18:57] <om26er> mterry, hey, would you be able to review ubuntu-keyboard packaging for it to be released daily ?
[18:57] <mterry> om26er, sure.   is that the project name?

[18:59] <omer> If this is the wrong place to ask a question, should I post in the forums?
[19:01] <sarnold> omer: you may need to include more details, here or elsewhere. which package? what packaging format? are you confident bzr builddeb is supposed to do anything useful wit hthe package in question? etc..
[19:02] <omer> sarnold: I was just trying to follow the guide here: http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/fixing-a-bug.html
[19:02] <omer> I used edit-patch to create a patch
[19:03] <omer> and then from what I understand I need to use bzr builddeb to create the dsc file
[19:03] <omer> the package was libraw
[19:03] <omer> I'm trying to compile it with some features enabled
[19:05] <mterry> om26er, what is supposed to be in the tests package?  Doesn't look like anything gets installed into it
[19:05] <mterry> (autopilot tests?)
[19:06] <om26er> mterry, yes there will autopilot tests, they are not yet
[19:06] <om26er> someone is working on it already
[19:06] <mterry> om26er, k
[19:06] <sarnold> omer: I think I'd try two things: (a) try "quilt push -a" before running 'edit-patch' (b) try "quilt push -a" after running edit-patch.  :)
[19:07] <omer> okay, thanks!
[19:20] <mterry> om26er, what about the various executables like word-candidates and language-layout-loading?  Are those meant to be installed (they are not currently)
[19:22] <om26er> mterry, I am not sure about that, I think how it is, is fine :)
[19:22] <mterry> om26er, OK
[19:31] <janimo> stgraber, hi do you know  why lxc-create of a saucy armhf container on an amd64 host would fail while a raring one is created?
[19:31] <janimo> stgraber, , I get Package iproute:amd64 is not available, but is referred to by another package
[19:32] <sarnold> janimo: iproute was replaced by iproute2 somewhere along the way..
[19:32] <janimo> sarnold, but is this something lxc-create/debootstrap needs to learn explicitly?
[19:33] <sarnold> janimo: probably a bug should be filed against the package that refers to iproute in saucy, so it can be fixed
[19:36] <stgraber> janimo: oops, yeah, we hardcode that in lxc, I'll have to fix this
[19:37] <stgraber> janimo: please file a bug against lxc
[19:37] <stgraber> janimo: you can easily fix it locally in /usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-ubuntu
[19:37] <janimo> stgraber, ok I will
[19:39] <janimo> stgraber, but the fact that iproute was removed from saucy (apparently) is related though?
[19:39] <janimo> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/iproute/+publishinghistory
[19:43] <stgraber> janimo: yep, iproute2 is the new iproute
[19:43] <janimo> stgraber, so all dependencies need to be changed or should that package Provide iproute?
[19:44] <stgraber> janimo: I fixed all the rdepends before I demoted iproute to universe, so at least in main, everything now uses iproute2
[19:44] <stgraber> I just missed lxc because it wasn't a depend but hardcoded in a script
[19:45] <janimo> stgraber, thanks for the pointer it worked after changing the template
