[01:06] <hallyn_> lifeless: i was going to push netcf to saucy so you could test the memory leak, but i seem to nto have upload perms again (was sure it had been added to server set last time...)  but you should be able to build your own from  http://people.canonical.com/~serge/netcf-saucy.debdiff
[01:06] <lifeless> heh, I'm on raring anyhow; will have a poke
[01:07] <hallyn_> lifeless: should be almost identical (but will pushd ebdiff for that in just a moment - of course that will need sru to get into the archive :)
[01:14] <infinity> hallyn_: I can sponsor that for you.
[01:15] <infinity> hallyn_: Or I can sponsor it to Debian and you can sync.
=== Ursinha-afk is now known as Ursinha
[01:22] <hallyn_> infinity: thanks.  originally i was going to wait for ahs3 to sponsor to sid and sync from there, but then i was thinking it would be worth testing in saucy immediately.  so i can go either way.
[01:23] <infinity> hallyn_: Your call.
[01:24] <hallyn_> infinity: ok, pls do push to saucy
[01:24] <hallyn_> meanwhile i should figure out why gnulib (under netcf/) wont' build on jessie
[01:26] <infinity> hallyn_: Uploaded.  And where is this gnulib jessie build failure?
[01:26] <infinity> hallyn_: You mean specifically jessie, but not sid?
[01:27] <infinity> ... in which I discover that I still don't have jessie chroots, only squeeze, wheezy, sid, and experimental.  Oops.
[01:33] <hallyn_> infinity: yeah, only jessie.  one sec, the failure is:
[01:33] <hallyn_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5983302/
[01:35] <infinity> Erm, that really *only* fails on jessie?
[01:35] <infinity> Now I need to create a chroot just to satisfy my curiosity. :P
[01:36] <hallyn_> yeah wheezy and sid were both happy.
=== JZTech101 is now known as JZ|Zzz
[01:36] <hallyn_> so it's complaining that gets is undefined when it's being marked insecure?  weird.
[02:04] <hallyn_> apparently cjwatson worked around a similar bug in grub2, commenting in changelog "Avoid assuming that gets is declared"
[02:04] <hallyn_> (still waiting for devscripts to install so i can look more closely)
[02:06]  * hallyn_ sees if he can just steal gnulib_gets.patch
[02:13] <hallyn_> yup
[02:29] <infinity> hallyn_: So, uhm, it builds on jessie for me.
[02:30] <infinity> hallyn_: http://lucifer.0c3.net/~adconrad/netcf_0.2.3-3ubuntu1_amd64.build
[02:31] <lifeless> hallyn_: builds fine on raring
[02:31] <hallyn_> infinity: well that's whack.  i needed: http://people.canonical.com/~serge/netcf-jessie.debdiff
[02:32] <infinity> hallyn_: That patch certainly won't hurt, but curious that it Works For Me. :P
[02:32] <lifeless> hallyn_: running that build now, will see if it leaks overnight
[02:32] <hallyn_> infinity: wait, that's the wrong version
[02:33] <hallyn_> infinity: jessie has 1:0.2.0-5, you compiled netcf_0.2.3-3ubuntu1.dsc ?
[02:33] <hallyn_> lifeless: great - thanks
[02:33] <infinity> hallyn_: Oh, fair enough.  But who cares, then?  When 2.3-3 migrates, you're good.
[02:33] <hallyn_> here's hoping
[02:33] <infinity> hallyn_: I assume 2.3-3 has a newer gnulib that deals with glibc >= 2.16 correctly.
[02:34] <hallyn_> infinity: heh, i admit i'm not clear on the package migration path ever since jessie was introduced
[02:34] <infinity> hallyn_: jessie = testing.  How is that unclear? :)
[02:34] <infinity> hallyn_: squeeze = oldstable, wheezy = stable, jessie = testing, packages migrate from sid to testing.
[02:34] <hallyn_> what is it waiting on for the sid version to get to jesie?
[02:35] <infinity> hallyn_: Looks like migrating it causes libvirt to become uninstallable.
[02:35] <infinity> hallyn_: Perhaps just waiting for the two to migrate together, I didn't look.
[02:35] <hallyn_> ok
[02:36] <hallyn_> so is it more unorthodox to push fixes into jessie then rather than wait for them to get through sid?
[02:36] <infinity> hallyn_: One generally doesn't upload to testing, except in a freeze.
[02:37] <infinity> hallyn_: That would be equivalent to an Ubuntu developer uploading to saucy (which we just don't allow, we redirect everything to saucy-proposed, which is our own "unstable")
[02:37] <infinity> hallyn_: That said, 74 days without migration is impressive, you might want to look at why it breaks libvirt. :P
[02:38] <hallyn_> gotcha.  so a waste of time is what that was :)
[02:38] <hallyn_> yeah
[02:38] <hallyn_> noted for later thsi week
[02:40] <hallyn_> all right on that note i'm heading to bed - \o
[02:48] <lifeless> hallyn_: looks good to me
[02:49] <hallyn_> lifeless: meaning memleak is gone?
[02:49] <lifeless> yes
[02:49] <hallyn_> \o/  thanks :)
[02:49] <lifeless> no growth at all
[02:49] <hallyn_> maybe i'll just start the sru right now then
[03:55] <lifeless> hallyn_: actually, it may still be leaking
[03:55] <lifeless> hallyn_: several hours got a 1M increase.
[03:55] <lifeless> hallyn_: but massively better...

[10:05] <rbasak> stgraber, hallyn_: around? I can't install mysql-server-5.5 in an lxc container, because it tries to load an apparmor profile. I understand the reason (thanks to http://s3hh.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/lxc-in-precise-and-beyond/) but I wonder if we can make the apparmor profile load in the container a noop in this case?
[10:12] <rbasak> stokachu: any news on bug 1121874 please? mysql-5.5 is stuck in saucy-proposed - I think because of a dep8 failure because of the same regression.

[11:50] <seb128> does anyone knowing how image build/tasks work exactly could help us to figure out what's the issue with cups-filters/ghostscript-cups
[11:50] <hallyn_> rbasak: A few points,
[11:50] <seb128> the first one is replacing the second and all rdepends got updated to depends on cups-filter (>= 1.0.36) | ghostscript-cups
[11:50] <seb128> but that seems to make CD builds unhappy for some reasons
[11:50] <hallyn_> rbasak: 1. stacked apparmor profiles should be coming soon, which will allow the apparmor profile load to work
[11:50] <seb128> tkamppeter, ogra_: ^
[11:51] <hallyn_> rbasak: 2. the solutionright now is supposed to be to run the container unconfined (lxc.aa_profile = unconfined), I guess
[11:51] <hallyn_> rbasak: 3. it seems reasonable to me to have mysql postinst allow apparmor profile load to fail if it is in a container, but we'd have to ask security team how they felt about it...
[11:52] <hallyn_> jjohansen: mdeslaur: ^
[11:53] <jamespage> slangasek, hey - I started looking at merging samba from Debian but noticed the unreleased splits of the init scripts that you had done had been dropped in unstable - was that intentional?
[11:53] <mdeslaur> jdstrand: ^
[11:54] <hallyn_> lifeless: well, drat, but i'll run it under valgrind again in a few days and see what i can find
[11:55] <tkamppeter> cjwatson, hi
[11:55] <mdeslaur> jdstrand: don't we already have code to deal with packages loading in a container?
=== MacSlow|lunch is now known as MacSlow
[12:06] <siretart> infinity: I've uploaded libav9 to unstable yesterday, iow, the transition has started now in debian
[12:10] <rbasak> hallyn_: thanks. I was thinking about something like having the apparmor package arrange for _all_ apparmor loads to fail if they are in containers.
[12:10] <rbasak> I mean silently noop, not fail.
[12:11] <rbasak> (or perhaps just a warning to stderr)
[12:11] <rbasak> Given that we know that lxc security is currently still somewhat limited, I don't think that this would cause a surprise compromise in any real use case.
[12:18] <hallyn_> rbasak: but also,
[12:19] <hallyn_> rbasak: given that the host is already protected from mysql by the container profile, the mysql profile isn't as crucial.
[12:19] <hallyn_> still, stacked profiles ftw :)
[12:27] <rbasak> Right
[12:28] <rbasak> Unless the user's expectation is that the inside of the container is protected by the mysql profile too.
[12:30] <hallyn_> rbasak: that expectation would be wrong as per the server guide :)  They can also expect user namespace protection, that woudl be wrong too.  ("sadly" on both :( )
[12:30] <hallyn_> lifeless: ok so 'lxc-create -B dir' on a btrfs DOES avoid the subvolume creation for me
[12:31] <hallyn_> I'm loath to change default behavior, but at the same time we're nto at 1.0 yet, and I'm not sure where we would document this...
[12:52] <pete-woods> fginther: hi again! I have another project for enabling CI on (https://launchpad.net/indicator-secret-agent) - it should have working support for test and coverage reporting already
[12:52] <fginther> pete-woods, ack, I can get started on it in a few minutes
[12:52] <pete-woods> fginther: awesome! :)
[13:02] <ev> so scan-build is pretty cool
[13:07] <lifeless> hallyn_: ok, so I'll follow your lead here.
[13:08] <lifeless> hallyn_: the main feedback I can give you is that while its nice (if you want it) that it happens by default, its very surprising, given that the btrfs docs say subvolumes are == filesystems
[13:08] <lifeless> hallyn_: you don't expect lxc-create to make a new filesystem by default, after all.
[13:10] <hallyn_> lifeless: yeah maybe it shoudl be teh default with -B btrfs but not when -B is not set
[13:10] <hallyn_> meaning, auto-detection of btrfs should perhaps be dropped
[13:10] <hallyn_> but i'd have to get input from smoser on that at this ponit.  pretty sure last time he said he was ok with that,
[13:10] <hallyn_> but i'm not sure if by now he's come to depend on it

[13:32] <jdstrand> mdeslaur, hallyn_ , rbasak: /lib/init/apparmor-profile-load already has code to not load in a container

[13:33] <jdstrand> s/apparmor upstart stanza/upstart apparmor stanza/
[13:45] <tkamppeter> cjwatson, can you have a look at bug 1212239? It seems to be a problem of how the images get generated.
[13:45] <ubottu> bug 1212239 in cups-filters (Ubuntu) "cups-filters is reported to have unmet dependencies with the latest saucy server installations" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1212239
[13:52] <smoser> lifeless, other than your understanding of some bit of documentation in a man page for btrfs, do you have some reason as to why creating subvolumes is bad ?
[13:54] <smoser> hallyn_, i think maybe we want something like '-B ANY', '-B NONE', '-B IF_POSSIBLE', '-B btrfs,lvm,none'
[14:00] <rbasak> jdstrand: that's odd. The upstart script uses /lib/init/apparmor-profile-load, so I'm not sure why that isn't working. Thanks - I'll look in detail again later.
[14:01] <jdstrand> rbasak: note that apparmor-profile-load does this:
[14:01] <jdstrand> [ -x /bin/running-in-container ] && /bin/running-in-container >/dev/null 2>&1 && exit 0
[14:01] <jdstrand> rbasak: so maybe running-in-container doesn't exist or isn't working right?
[14:02] <rbasak> jdstrand: I'll check. Also, would dh-apparmor in debian/rules affect anything?
[14:06] <jdstrand> rbasak: it will put in postinst something to load the profile into the kernel

[14:28] <rbasak> Wow. That's an impressive bug!
[14:32] <hallyn_> smoser: -B btrfs,lvm,dir I'm ok with.  The others sound too magical.  (and '-B dir' is -B NONE IIUC)
[14:32] <smoser> literal 'dir' ?
[14:32] <hallyn_> yes
[14:32] <hallyn_> dir for directory
[14:33] <smoser> hallyn_, that would be fine then.
[14:33] <smoser> the only thing  i dont like is that i dont want ot have to know a list of what is availalbe.
[14:33] <smoser> thus 'ANY'
[14:34] <hallyn_> smoser: if there were more possibilities that would make sense...  the thing about lvm and zfs is that there are more parameters
[14:34] <smoser> ah. well then the comma delimited falls apart anyway
[14:34] <hallyn_> we could simply assume that if a vg called lxc or zfs group called lxc exists,
[14:34] <hallyn_> then it's "available".
[14:34] <smoser> i would do that.
[14:34] <hallyn_> anyway I'm goign to opena  bug where we can collect this info and make a decision
[14:35] <hallyn_> smoser: thanks
[14:35] <rbasak> jdstrand: turns out that there were two errors, and the postinst dh-apparmor warning fooled me into thinking that it was an apparmor problem.
[14:36] <smoser> i sweare there was a feature in openstack now for termination protection
[14:36] <rbasak> jdstrand: dh-apparmor does "apparmor_parser -r -T -W "$APP_PROFILE" || true" which fails with "apparmor_parser: Unable to replace "/usr/sbin/mysqld".  Permission denied; attempted to load a profile while confined?\nWarning failed to create cache: usr.sbin.mysqld" but of course doesn't cause the postinst to fail.
[14:36] <rbasak> jdstrand: thanks for your help.
[14:37] <jdstrand> rbasak: ah, good, glad I could help :)
[14:41] <hallyn_> smoser: btw, not sure if lifeless has responded (doesn't look like it) - creating subvolumes can be bad because rsync -va --one-filesystem will not back up the subvolumes

[14:55] <smoser> wildcard in gnu make does not allow for exclude
[14:56] <hallyn_> can you do some $(filter) crap?
[14:57] <hallyn_> (just thinking however debian/rules often detects arch)
[14:58] <hallyn_> smoser: eh, it's probably not worth it.  it's not something that will cause regressions
[15:02] <smoser> hallyn_, fwiw, this works
[15:02] <smoser> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5985282/
[15:03] <smoser> but would include other stuff in that dir

[18:37] <smoser> is 'dch -D some-thing --release' broken for anyone else?
[18:39] <infinity> ogra_: It's because it recommends and conflicts.
[18:39] <ogra_> oh

[18:40] <infinity> ogra_: At least, that's my best guess.  And it's a bug either way.
[18:41] <ogra_> yeah

[18:44] <esing> hi
[18:44] <esing> How do I install gummiboot on ubuntu
[18:45] <infinity> ogra_: Uploaded.  Will test in a chroot to make sure this fixes it once it's built.
[18:46]  * ogra_ hugs infinity 
[18:46] <ogra_> (dont infect me though)
[18:55] <smoser> infinity, i uploaded. http://paste.ubuntu.com/5986081/ is diff from last upload.
[18:56] <infinity> smoser: Shiny, thanks.  Once I get utlemming's fixed walinuxthingee, I'll do them together.
[19:14] <infinity> ogra_: Right, this should definitely fix it.  The problem was that cups-filters Recommending ghostscript-cups landed the ghostscript-cups package in the ubuntu-desktop task.  So, when you went to install the task, it exploded.
[19:14] <infinity> ogra_: Can't test for sure until it's all migrated to the release pocket and gs-cups falls out of the task, but logically it makes sense.
[19:15] <ogra_> yeah, it definitely does ...

[19:16] <infinity> Bah, and same fix needs to be applied to cups itself.

[19:39] <infinity> Aaaand, the cups testsuite fails now.  Awesome.
[19:39] <infinity> tkamppeter: HALP.  CUPS sucks.
[19:40] <ogra_> hahaha
[19:41] <infinity> FAIL: 35 error messages, expected 33.
[19:41] <infinity> So informative.
[19:45] <tkamppeter> infinity, it worked for me last time, what did you change?
[19:45] <infinity> tkamppeter: Nothing in the code.
[19:45] <infinity> tkamppeter: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cups/1.6.3-1ubuntu1
[19:45] <tkamppeter> infinity, and why are you rebuilding CUPS?
[19:45] <infinity> See above.
[19:48] <infinity> tkamppeter: As it turns out, though, my motivation for uploading doesn't change whether or not the testsuite works. :P
[19:49] <infinity> tkamppeter: Anyhow, image builds will continue to be broken until a cups that doesn't Recommend ghostscript-cups actually manages to build.  I leave the testsuite breakage to you, since I suspect you know it much better than I do.

[19:53] <infinity> E [14/Aug/2013:13:50:34.039476 -0600] Filter "gstoraster" not found.
[19:54] <infinity> I'm assuming those are the lines to blame..
[19:58] <tkamppeter> infinity, I see, CUPS needs to build-depend on cups-filters now where Ghostscript-cups has gone away ...
[19:58] <infinity> tkamppeter: It does.
[19:58] <infinity> tkamppeter: I have it installed here, make check still fails with that.
[20:00] <infinity> tkamppeter: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5986315/
[20:00] <infinity> tkamppeter: So, something more weird is going on...
[20:08] <tkamppeter> infinity, the test suite of CUPS is really broken, it should not depend on cups-filters nor on ghostscript (which is needed by gstoraster which the test suite tries to call).
[20:12] <infinity> tkamppeter: Sure, but both cups-filters and ghostscript *are* build-deps, and are installed.
[20:12] <infinity> tkamppeter: And it's the server startup that's whining about gstoraster being missing.
[20:13] <infinity> Well, "missing".  It's obviously there. :/
[20:43] <tkamppeter> infinity, CUPS does a really bad thing, it links the filters contained in cups-filters one by one into the test filter directory, meaning that CUPS' test suite needs to be changed with every change of cups-filters making the "make check" of CUPS only work with a few versions of cups-filters.
[20:48] <infinity> tkamppeter: Ah, I *just* got there myself and was about to upload a fix. :)
[20:48] <tkamppeter> infinity, debian/patches/tests-use-cupsfilters.patch needs to get fixed, adding a link for gstoraster.
[20:48] <infinity> tkamppeter: Already one it.
[20:48] <infinity> s/one/on/
[20:53] <infinity> tkamppeter: Test building, thanks for the extra set of eyes on that one.
[21:00] <tkamppeter> infinity, did the package build for you now?
[21:00] <infinity> tkamppeter: Oh, erk.  There's also the IPP compliance tests failing.  Fun.

[21:26] <infinity> tkamppeter: Yeah, those ipp failures have me a little bit stumped.  Possibly a race between creating fake jobs and looking for them?
[21:48] <brendand> sorry to ask again, i had to reboot so may have missed a response. i've upgraded to saucy and unity won't seem to start. unity_support_test returns 0 though

[22:21] <tkamppeter> infinity, I have done test builds of CUPS 1.6.3 and 1.7rc1 on my Saucy machine now and I get exactly the same IPP failures. Seems to be that something changed in Saucy which breaks the CUPS tests.
[22:30] <infinity> tkamppeter: Alright, I'm uploading an ugly hack for now to ignore the IPP failures, so this can build and images can be buildable again, but obviously this needs looking into.

[22:43] <tkamppeter> infinity, thank you very much, and sorry for the inconvenience. The test suite of CUPS is really a problem.
