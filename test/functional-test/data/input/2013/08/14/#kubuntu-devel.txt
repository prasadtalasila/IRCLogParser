[01:48] <Riddell> bah, copy package doesn't want to work http://paste.kde.org/p13184721/
[01:48] <Riddell> dantti_laptop: should printer setup pick the driver automatically?
[02:01] <Riddell> damnit, needs --ppa-name added else it breaks, humph
[02:10] <Riddell> 4.11 copied to raring backports PPA
[02:11] <Riddell> yofel: what's in that digikam in ninjas?  it's digikam 3.2 while backports has 3.3 so it didn't copy
[02:12]  * Riddell snoozes
[05:55] <jussi> shadeslayer: oh shadeslayer!
[05:56] <shadeslayer> hi
[07:47] <Riddell> !testers | 4.11 for raring in kubuntu-ppa/backports
[07:47] <ubottu> 4.11 for raring in kubuntu-ppa/backports: Help is needed in #kubuntu-devel. Please ping Riddell, yofel, soee, Tm_T, shadeslayer, BluesKaj, James147, smartboyhw, Quintasan, lordievader, shrini, tester56 for information.
[07:47] <shadeslayer> backports? I'm testing 4.11 for precise from ninjas
[07:48] <Riddell> that's good too, precise is still in ninjas
[07:48] <shadeslayer> ack
[07:48] <Riddell> I've not tested that at all
[07:48] <shadeslayer> waiting for apt to finish
[07:49] <shadeslayer> Riddell: Quantal:
[07:49] <shadeslayer>   I'm not interested in Quantal - jriddell
[07:49] <shadeslayer>   Drop Quantal and only support Raring / Precise then? This needs to be properly communicated via kubuntu.org IMHO
[07:56] <Riddell> that's my opinion
[07:56] <Riddell> and I'm sticking to it :)
[07:57] <shadeslayer> yes, but I'm not particularly keen on supporting Quantal as well :P
[07:57] <shadeslayer> so we should put an announcement saying "Switch to Precise / Raring "
[07:58] <Riddell> yep
[08:46] <shadeslayer> yofel: see http://paste.kde.org/p6045c9d5/
[08:46] <shadeslayer> kwin being removed is not good :P
[08:47] <shadeslayer> also probably why kubuntu-lts-backport doesn't work maybe
[08:47] <soee> Riddell, hows the 4.11 for raring (64)?
[08:50] <shadeslayer> uhh
[08:50] <shadeslayer> [15223.293944] nepomukservices[1545]: segfault at 0 ip           (null) sp 00007fffd70a39a8 error 14 in nepomukservicestub (deleted)[400000+7000]
[08:50] <shadeslayer> on 12.04
[09:02] <shadeslayer> Riddell: precise works for me, but I would not make it public yet
[09:02] <shadeslayer> we need to sort the HWE stack
[09:22] <Riddell> soee: needing testing in kubuntu-ppa/backports
[09:33] <Tm_T> time to upgrade KDE
[09:34] <Riddell> Tm_T: what to?
[09:34] <Tm_T> I assume 4.11 is what I'm getting from repos
[09:34] <Tm_T> yup
[09:34] <Tm_T> from ninjas it seems
=== ghostcube_ is now known as ghostcube
[09:35] <shadeslayer> Tm_T: I'd recommend removing ninjas on production systems :P
[09:36] <shadeslayer> it's just for testing
[09:36] <shadeslayer> and building
[09:36] <Tm_T> oh, I often test
[09:36] <Riddell> Tm_T: hang on, this is raring?
[09:36] <Tm_T> hmm, yes
[09:36] <Riddell> Tm_T: please test from backports
[09:36] <Riddell> kubuntu-ppa/backports
[09:36] <Tm_T> hmm, I wonder why it chooses ninjas instead of backports
[09:37] <Tm_T> let's kick it a bit
[09:37] <Riddell> they're the same packages, just copied over, but backports needs that final test before announce
[09:38] <Tm_T> downloading from backports currently
[09:38] <Tm_T> not proposing any packages being removed or held back
[09:40] <Tm_T> no new packages to install either, which is understandable as I'm already in .11 series (beta/rc)
[10:31] <yofel> shadeslayer: kubuntu-lts-backport doesn't really work, but on my notebook 4.11 ran fine with mesa8
[10:32] <yofel> Riddell: probably the old digikam rebuild, please make sure 4.11 in backports has a digikam build to go along with it
[10:32] <yofel> otherwise the kipi-plugins don't work
[10:35] <Riddell> ah, kipi, that old tricksy library, I always imagine it as a library with an organutang like in discworld
[10:35] <shadeslayer> yofel: do you have instructions on how to install the HWE stack without removing kwin?
[10:35] <yofel> shadeslayer: not yet
[10:36] <shadeslayer> okay
[10:38] <yofel> Riddell: oh, and copy amarok from the beta ppa, 2.7.1 is unusable with 4.11 unless patched
[10:38] <Riddell> good point
[10:41] <soee> Riddell, fonts-lyx libopencolorio1 libphononexperimental4 libyaml-cpp0.3
[10:42] <soee> those are some new packages to be installed when upgrading ?
[10:44] <Riddell> soee: seems fine
[10:54] <yofel> shadeslayer: this seems to work
[10:54] <yofel> # apt-get install xserver-xorg-lts-raring libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-raring libglapi-mesa-lts-raring libgles2-mesa-lts-raring libegl1-mesa-lts-raring
[10:56] <yofel> sadly doing the same by metapackage doesn't seem to work :S
[11:07] <Tm_T> 4.11 on raring, all installs nicely
[11:11] <shadeslayer> yofel: yeah that looks good

[11:13] <yofel> yeah, could you remove kubuntu-lts-backport from kubuntu-meta then please?
[11:13] <yofel> if it doesn't work it's just confusing
[11:13] <shadeslayer> sure
[11:13] <shadeslayer> that's from kubuntu-meta right?

[11:19] <shadeslayer> ah, not a separate dh package
[11:19] <yofel> why germinate?
[11:20] <yofel> you can't use germinate here
[11:20] <shadeslayer> kubuntu-meta runs dh clean --with germinate
[11:20] <yofel> ah
[11:21]  * yofel didn't notice ^^
[11:24] <shadeslayer> uploaded

[11:30] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, wow
[11:31]  * smartboyhw only wants a Ultrabook over $1500 USD
[11:31] <smartboyhw> :P
[11:31] <shadeslayer> heh
[11:31] <yofel> kernel panic, fun
[11:32] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh:(
[11:32] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: ultrabooks are overrated 
[11:32] <shadeslayer> get a thinkpad
[11:32] <shadeslayer> get a T440 whe it comes out
[11:32] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, how much does it cost? And what are the specs？
[11:32] <shadeslayer> no idea on cost
[11:32] <shadeslayer> google around
[11:32] <yofel> shadeslayer: *drool*
[11:33] <shadeslayer> there's also the X240
[11:33]  * smartboyhw wonders why Quintasan suddenly has so many blog posts on Planet Ubuntu...
[11:33] <shadeslayer> which was released recently
[11:33] <Quintasan> what
[11:33] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, look at planet.ubuntu.com
[11:33] <shadeslayer> yofel: I'd buy it if I could only think of a proper use for it xD
[11:33] <smartboyhw> You have posts from after UDS-P it seems
[11:33] <smartboyhw> :o
[11:33] <yofel> true :D
[11:33] <Quintasan> ...
[11:33] <shadeslayer> sure you could host owncloud, but I also want to host mykolab
[11:34] <smartboyhw> What I want is a 1TB server to mirror things:p
[11:34] <Quintasan> Well, looks like editing visibility also causes the bot to pickup the posts as new ones
[11:34] <Quintasan> God damn it
[11:34] <shadeslayer> and for that I need a very good internet connection :P
[11:34]  * smartboyhw just fixed his wifi to become faster
[11:34] <Quintasan> lol no
[11:34] <Quintasan> Don't get a damn T440
[11:34] <shadeslayer> why not?
[11:34] <smartboyhw> At least it doesn't lag while using IRC + Firefox + sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[11:34] <shadeslayer> fwiw it's not even out yet
[11:34] <Quintasan> Did you even look at the keyboard?
[11:34] <shadeslayer> It's not out yet
[11:35] <shadeslayer> is it?
[11:35]  * smartboyhw does not care about design
[11:35] <Quintasan> If it's going to have the same shitty keyboard as T430 which I have
[11:35] <Quintasan> Then srsly
[11:35]  * smartboyhw cares only about spec
[11:35] <shadeslayer> also, I use a external keyboard and mouse

[11:35] <shadeslayer> ololololo
[11:35] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://www.hotmcu.com/marsboard-a20-dev-board-p-60.html
[11:36] <yofel> smartboyhw: you don't have to be that sensitive...
[11:36] <smartboyhw> yofel, because I'm tired of hearing all these words at school...
[11:36] <yofel> *shrug*
[11:36]  * yofel grew up hearing them all the time
[11:36] <smartboyhw> Anyways...
[11:37] <Quintasan> Well, I was going apeshit with that Print Screen key
[11:37] <Quintasan> Same as agateau
[11:37] <shadeslayer> heh
[11:37] <shadeslayer> yeah you can xmodmap that away
[11:37] <Quintasan> Some bloody idiot thought it's a good idea to place the Print Screen key where Menu key was supposed to be.
[11:37] <Quintasan> Not under Windows :D
[11:37] <shadeslayer> and anyway I use a external TVS Gold keyboard
=== ghostcube_ is now known as ghostcube
[11:37] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, you mean the Lenovo ThinkPad right?
[11:37] <shadeslayer> cheapest ( and the awesomest ) mechanical keyboard money can buy
[11:37] <shadeslayer> with blue cherry switches
[11:38] <Quintasan> I'd rather get an older model now that I think about it.
[11:38] <Quintasan> The one with rotating screen from X series
[11:38] <smartboyhw> I went to try the soft detachable keyboard of Microsoft Surface RT today, VERY TERRIBLE.
[11:38] <yofel> http:/blog.laptopmag.com/thinkpad-type-off-is-lenovos-new-island-style-keyboard-better-or-worse
[11:38] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: yes
[11:38] <yofel> ok, that PrtSc is WTF
[11:38] <Quintasan> brb
[11:39] <yofel> although on my edge it's at the same place
[11:39] <yofel> I just never press it
[11:39] <smartboyhw> Nice keyboard:P
[11:39] <smartboyhw> Ignore my art sense though plz, I never did good at art
[11:41] <smartboyhw> Wow, build status on raring 4.11.0 looks great
[11:41] <smartboyhw> Has it migrated yet?
[11:41] <shadeslayer> yep
[11:42] <smartboyhw> Hmm, is Precise there?
[11:42] <smartboyhw> Yep
[11:42] <smartboyhw> :P
[11:42] <shadeslayer> in ninjas
[11:42] <smartboyhw> Hmm, looks clean too
[11:42] <Quintasan> yofel: It's like

[11:43] <Quintasan> "I DON'T USE THIS KEY SO LET'S GET RID OF IT
[11:43] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, raring in beta or backports ppa?
[11:43] <yofel> indeed
[11:43] <Quintasan> AND PLACE PRINT SCREEN SINCE IT ALSO DOESNT DO ANYTHING
[11:43] <smartboyhw> Backports?
[11:43] <shadeslayer> backports
[11:43]  * shadeslayer realllllly wants that board

[11:43] <shadeslayer> but no justification to buy it
[11:43] <yofel> well, it makes using sysrq less of an acrobatic stunt :P
[11:43] <shadeslayer> heh
[11:44]  * shadeslayer has the standard 104 key keyboard
[11:44] <shadeslayer> with the rupee symbol
[11:44]  * yofel likes his old T510 
[11:46] <smartboyhw> OK, somebody please fix okular in precise:P
[11:46] <smartboyhw> Then we can release it I think
[11:46]  * smartboyhw needs to take a shower, so don't ask him
[11:47] <Tm_T> Riddell: all looks good in raring
[11:47] <Tm_T> installs fine runs fine
[11:48] <smartboyhw> Tm_T, has shadeslayer asked you for some ktp raring QA?
[11:49] <yofel> nvm okular
[11:49]  * shadeslayer nominates smartboyhw to do the paperwork for Raring SRU
[11:49] <yofel> that's fine
[11:49] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, eh, let me take the shower first plz...
[11:49] <shadeslayer> sure
[11:50]  * yofel edits the hook so that ends up in not-installed
[11:50] <smartboyhw> yofel, so probably we can migrate it to backports ppa
[11:51] <smartboyhw> I mean, 4.11.0 precise
[11:51] <Tm_T> smartboyhw: not that I know
[11:53] <yofel> smartboyhw: no
[11:53] <yofel> smartboyhw: you can move it once kubuntu-meta finished updating, you've verified that it runs, that the kipi-plugins work fine and that amarok is ok
[11:54] <yofel> please don't push untested software onto users
[11:55]  * yofel had 3 full system lockups in the last half hour
[11:55] <yofel> I think 3.11 and lxc don't like each other
[12:03] <yofel> shadeslayer: btw, if you ever need to comment out a package in a control file with sed:
[12:03] <yofel>  sed -e '/^Package: active-documentviewer$/,/^$/ s.^.#.' 
[12:03] <shadeslayer> yes I saw that
[12:03] <shadeslayer> care to explain?
[12:03] <shadeslayer> -> sed newb
[12:04] <yofel> from "^Package: active-documentviewer$", to "^$" (empty line), do s.^.#. (where the regular / is replaced by .)
[12:08] <shadeslayer> o_O
[12:08] <shadeslayer> $ denotes end of line?
[12:09] <tsimpson> yes
[12:09] <shadeslayer> I know ^ denotes begins with
[12:09] <shadeslayer> aha cool
[12:09] <shadeslayer> makes sense to me
[12:11]  * shadeslayer giggles at http://www.wandboard.org/
[12:12] <yofel> heh
[12:14] <smartboyhw> yofel, I will probably package amarok once it's tagged (2.8.0)
[12:16]  * smartboyhw goes and does the paperwork for ktp
[12:17] <yofel> sure, go ahead
[12:17] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, where does your packages reside?
[12:17] <smartboyhw> I mean, ktp raring
[12:17] <smartboyhw> And can somebody nominate the release for raring...

[12:26] <shadeslayer> so heavy the street will soon turn into a boat
[12:26] <shadeslayer> erm, s/boat/river/

[12:28] <shadeslayer> whee the rain is coming inside my room, and the door is like 3 feet away
[12:29] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, tell people to report bugs when there's a regression?

[12:30] <shadeslayer> go on, what kind of regressions are we looking for?
[12:30] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, crashes
[12:30] <shadeslayer> not really

[12:30] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, ah, that.
[12:30] <shadeslayer> packages being uninstallable
[12:31] <shadeslayer> those are ubuntu specific things, if KTP crashes it's not our fault ( unless caused by some random patch we threw in )

[12:54] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, ah? Source packages? Debian ABIs?
[12:55] <shadeslayer> nope & nope
[12:55] <smartboyhw> .......
[12:55] <shadeslayer> look at the man page now
[12:57] <yofel> ^^
[12:57] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, man dpkg-buildpackage just gives me -vversion...
[12:57] <smartboyhw> Probably version in changelog???
[12:57] <shadeslayer> didn't I say debuild?
[12:57] <shadeslayer> oh wait
[12:58] <shadeslayer> yeah so
[12:58] <shadeslayer> what does it do :?
[12:58] <shadeslayer> :>
[12:59] <shadeslayer> we should have asked this during the next interview :P
[12:59] <shadeslayer> but okay
[12:59] <yofel> this is so seldomly used that he would've hardly learned about it somewhere else
[13:00] <shadeslayer> well, it's suppsoedly used in SRU's
[13:00] <shadeslayer> uh, it's supposed to be used extensively in SRU's
[13:00]  * yofel never did SRU's that needed that
[13:00] <yofel> I only use it for merges
[13:01] <shadeslayer> I learnt it after ScottK poked me to use it for SRU's
[13:01] <yofel> smartboyhw: so, what's the effect?
[13:01] <yofel> this discussion feels like we're playing taboo ^^
[13:02] <shadeslayer> hehe
[13:02] <shadeslayer> damnit
[13:02] <shadeslayer> ScottK: can you reject call-ui with the ppa1 version
[13:04] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: feel free to take your time btw
[13:05] <shadeslayer> you don't have to answer straight away
[13:08] <shadeslayer> can someone QA kscreen plz
[13:08] <shadeslayer> preferably on actual HW
[13:10]  * Riddell out for a couple of hours
[13:10] <shadeslayer> cya
[13:11]  * shadeslayer is almost done for the day as well
[13:12] <yofel> kscreen what ver on what series from where?
[13:13] <shadeslayer> raring ofcourse :P
[13:13] <shadeslayer> 1.0.1 I think
[13:13] <shadeslayer> it's already in proposed
[13:13] <yofel> ah ok
[13:14] <yofel> what's up with ~ubuntu13.04.1 in SRU's btw?
[13:14] <yofel> new policy?
[13:15] <shadeslayer> well, I use it to make sure upgrades from raring to saucy work fine when the packages in saucy have the same version, though I could also use Xubuntu0.1
[13:17] <yofel> what do you do when you need to fix something?
[13:17] <yofel> 13.04.2?
[13:17] <shadeslayer> my packages are perfect!!! :P
[13:18] <shadeslayer> but yeah you're right :(
[13:18] <shadeslayer> now I get to upload the entire ktp stack again
[13:18] <shadeslayer> :'(
[13:18] <yofel> usually it's not an issue because you would fix saucy as well, but still. (and I was confused as this was usally the backports versioning)
[13:19] <shadeslayer> true true
[13:25] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, well, it works in backports so that you don't have to explicitly change the changelog version yourself by editing right?
[13:25] <smartboyhw> Why we have 13.04.1 and 13.04.2!?
[13:25] <shadeslayer> ScottK: please reject all ktp stuff because I am changing the version to Xubuntu0.1
[13:26] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, did you see my answer?
[13:26] <smartboyhw> ...
[13:27] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: what answer?
[13:27] <smartboyhw> <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, well, it works in backports so that you don't have to explicitly change the changelog version yourself by editing right?
[13:27] <smartboyhw> It's easier I think:)
[13:27] <shadeslayer> is that answer to what -v does?
[13:27] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yeah, and by running -v the changelog will not be altered but the package will be using the -v version no,
[13:27] <shadeslayer> nope
[13:28] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, no?
[13:28] <smartboyhw> Oh gor
[13:28] <smartboyhw> *god
[13:28] <smartboyhw>        -vversion
[13:28] <smartboyhw>               Causes changelog information from all  versions  strictly  later
[13:28] <smartboyhw>               than version to be used.
[13:29] <smartboyhw> Eh?
[13:29]  * smartboyhw doesn't understand thhat
[13:29] <shadeslayer> funky thing is dpkg-buildpackage -h documents the flag
[13:29] <shadeslayer>   -v<version>    changes since version <version>.
[13:29] <shadeslayer> does that make more sense?
[13:29] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh
[13:30] <smartboyhw> Ubuntu Edge just passed 10m
[13:31] <smartboyhw> 200000 away from hitting the record
[13:31] <shadeslayer> *shrug*
[13:32] <ScottK> shadeslayer: Done
[13:32] <shadeslayer> thx
[13:33] <shadeslayer> running script to fix the version
[13:34] <ScottK> yofel: You should also use -v for merges so you get all the Debian changelog entries on the .changes file.
[13:34] <yofel> ScottK: that's what I do, I just don't use it anywhere else
[13:35] <ScottK> Ah.  OK.
[13:35] <ScottK> Yeah, doesn't come up much otherwise.
[13:45] <shadeslayer> I wonder where murthy went
[13:45] <shadeslayer> I don't see him around these days
[13:46] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, +1
[13:46] <smartboyhw> What happened to him?
[13:48] <shadeslayer> phew
[13:48] <shadeslayer> ScottK: that should be everything
[13:50]  * shadeslayer is afk for a bit
[13:50] <shadeslayer> or rather, I'll return tomorrow morning
[13:50] <shadeslayer> cya
[13:56] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, tmr morning!?
[14:04] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: yes, I'm tired
[14:04] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh:(
[14:04] <smartboyhw> Good night then:P
[14:04] <shadeslayer> well, too early to sleep :P
[14:04] <shadeslayer> it's only 7:30 PM
[14:04] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, it's 10:04 PM here:P
[14:35] <dantti_laptop> Riddell: normally yes (about printer driver)

=== losdolmos is now known as zorael
[16:02] <Riddell> dantti_laptop: any ideas what I'm not installing to make that work? or should I ask till?
[16:03] <Riddell> Quintasan, shadeslayer, anyone: plasma active 4.0 tars due this evening
[16:03] <Quintasan> SPLENDID
[16:03] <Quintasan> We shall bring them into our repositories!
[16:03] <Riddell> some notes from martin http://paste.kde.org/p2993d2e9/
[16:06] <dantti_laptop> Riddell: do you have system-config-printer installed?
[16:07] <dantti_laptop> Riddell: basically if you just have system-config-printer-udev it will set it up even if you are not logged in
[16:07] <Riddell> dantti_laptop: hmm, I've system-config-printer-udev but not system-config-printer-common (or -gnome)
[16:07] <Riddell> dantti_laptop: alas it doesn't just set it up with system-config-printer-udev
[16:08] <dantti_laptop> Riddell: so, if you open the add printer dialog now you probably need the -gnome because if had the dbus interface used to find the best driver
[16:09] <dantti_laptop> Riddell: btw now I wonde why print-manager package does not depends on the -gnome anymore :P
[16:09] <dantti_laptop> *wonder
[16:13] <Riddell> dantti_laptop: well it's -gnome
[16:14] <dantti_laptop> well it should at least have a recommends then.. it would be good if the dbus interface didn't depend on gtk but well  :(
[16:14] <Riddell> I'll play around a bit with those installed thanks
[16:15] <dantti_laptop> yw, if you know the driver you can add using print-manager but s-c-p has a good logic to find the best ones, sadly that isn't easy to replicate 
[16:18] <Quintasan> shadeslayer, yofel: My brethren! We shall bestow the glory of new Plasma Active 4 upon our repostories so then can shine brightly and guide lost souls to our distribution
[17:40] <Riddell> hmm, precise not happy for upgrade
[17:40] <Riddell>  akonadi-server : Depends: libboost-program-options1.53.0 but it is not installable
[17:43]  * genii makes a note not to upgrade today
[17:43] <Riddell> that makes no sense, it build-deps on libboost-program-options1.48-dev
[17:43] <Riddell> ah hah s/saucy/precise/ in sources.list would help
[17:44] <Riddell> yes much better

[18:17] <yofel> Riddell: digikam and amarok were fixed before you copied, yes?
[18:18] <Riddell> yofel: hmm, what needs fixed?
[18:21] <Riddell> yofel: amarok is 2.7.90 and digikam is 3.3.0
[18:21] <yofel> digikam is built against 4.10, but amarok is ok

[18:26] <Riddell> how's this? https://www-admin.kubuntu.org/news/kde-4.11
[18:28] <Riddell> soee: all ok?
[18:29] <soee> Riddell, seems so
[18:29] <Riddell> lovely thanks
[18:30] <Riddell> how's this? http://www.kubuntu.org/news/kde-4.11
[18:32] <yofel> Riddell: wrong PPA
[18:32] <Riddell> tsk, changed it in one please but missed oher
[18:32] <Riddell> fixed
[18:32] <soee> is there some difference using apt-add-repository and add-apt-repository ?
[18:32] <yofel> soee: none, one is a symlink to the other
[18:32] <Riddell> soee: no same thing
[18:32] <Riddell> slightly confusing that
[18:39] <Riddell> groovy, I think that's a wrap, I'm going out for a canoe, thanks for your help yofel and others, call my mobile if problems occur (jriddell.org/contact.html)
[18:40] <yofel> sure, happy canoeing ;)
[18:42] <Quintasan> Riddell: Have a nice...trip?
[18:48] <Riddell> Quintasan: just an evening game of polo on the canal
[18:48] <Riddell> "KDE Community (@kdecommunity) favorited one of your Tweets!"  woo, we're upstream's favourite :)
[18:48] <Riddell> although I'm not convinced favorited is a word
[18:54] <Quintasan> 4.11 on raring went smoothly
[18:55]  * contrast is heartbroken that 4.11 won't be on Quantal.
[18:59] <shadeslayer> Riddell: 4.11 from ninjas on precise went smoothly
[18:59] <shadeslayer> we just need proper instructions on the release announcement so that people install the HWE stack
[19:07] <Quintasan> HWE?
[19:08] <skellat> Hardware Enablement
[19:08] <yofel> shadeslayer: how does it run for you without the HWE stack?
[19:09] <Quintasan> What the hell...
[19:09]  * Quintasan is totally not following now.
[19:09] <yofel> contrast: well, we *could* do it.
[19:09] <shadeslayer> yofel: huh?
[19:09] <shadeslayer> ah
[19:09] <shadeslayer> you switched the deps right
[19:09] <contrast> yofel: Go onn... :)
[19:10]  * yofel wonders where howards quantal stuff ended up at...
[19:10] <Quintasan> so what is this HWE stack you are talking about?
[19:10] <yofel> !info xserver-xorg-lts-raring precise
[19:11] <ubottu> xserver-xorg-lts-raring (source: xorg-lts-raring): X.Org X server. In component main, is optional. Version 1:7.7+1ubuntu4~precise1 (precise), package size 16 kB, installed size 188 kB (Only available for amd64; i386)
[19:11] <yofel> kernel/X/mesa backported from raring to precise-updates
[19:11] <Quintasan> oooh
[19:11] <yofel> with different names though
[19:11] <yofel> mostly intended for the point images
[19:12] <yofel> Quintasan: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack
[19:13] <yofel> *sigh*
[19:13] <yofel> I guess no UEFI support in 12.04.3 for us again
[19:16] <yofel> contrast: on that topic: why not upgrade to raring but stick to quantal?
[19:17] <contrast> I've been sticking with Quantal, due to the fact that 1) Unlike Raring, it will be supported until the next LTS comes out, and 2) I assumed new releases of KDE would be backported to it, as has generally been the case in the past. So now it looks like if I want 4.11, I need to update to Raring, and then update to Saucy in two months (since Raring will reach end-of-life in January).
[19:17] <yofel> hm
[19:18] <contrast> Sorry for the long rant -- I recognize you guys are somewhat under-staffed, and I really appreciate all the hard work you all do. :-) I'm just a bit frustrated.
[19:19] <yofel> contrast: *generating* the packages is actually not much work, so we can do that. The harder part would be finding someone to test them.
[19:19]  * contrast volunteers.
[19:20] <contrast> What all would go into that, specifically?
[19:22] <yofel> well, mostly just confirming that there's no major regression
[19:22] <shadeslayer> contrast: or just go back to precise since that will supported for a good amount of time
[19:24] <contrast> shadeslayer: I'd rather not downgrade my 2 systems, plus the other 4 systems (friends'/family members') I provide support for. Plus that would entail backporting every package in my PPA to Precise as well.
[19:25] <shadeslayer> which reminds me
[19:25] <shadeslayer> I need to find a way to get the latest hplip into precise
[19:25] <yofel> why that?
[19:25] <shadeslayer> something that was a huge blocker for using my desktop running LTS for my parents
[19:25] <shadeslayer> can't detect my printer
[19:27] <contrast> yofel: So basically: on a clean install of Quantal -> apt-get dist-upgrade with kubuntu-backports enabled -> check and make sure everything works ok?
[19:28] <contrast> speaking of printers, on a completely unrelated note, i was shocked to see that lexmark is providing properly packaged linux drivers on their website now.
[19:28] <yofel> contrast: almost, once everything is built on http://qa.kubuntu.co.uk/ninjas-status/build_status_4.11.0_quantal.html, install it and confirm it works
[19:31] <contrast> yofel: so install and test *everything* that's in that ppa? (i don't mind doing that at all if that's what it will take to get 4.11 on quantal, just want to make sure i'm understanding you correctly. :) )
[19:34] <shadeslayer> contrast: usually it's just a matter of checking if kubuntu-full installs without file conflicts
[19:34] <shadeslayer> and then running some of your choice apps from kubuntu-full :)
[19:34] <yofel> uh no, just a general check. Testing all of kde would take quite a while. It's usually checking the desktop in general, 
[19:35] <contrast> ahh ok. that's a relief then. :D
[19:37] <contrast> So if 4.11.0 gets backported to Quantal, will it be safe to assume that its bugfix releases will as well?
[19:37] <yofel> as long as someone can be found to test them
[19:39] <contrast> Awesome... So could I be added to a contact list for that or something, in case I don't just happen to show up in IRC on release day? :P
[19:40] <yofel> hm, we don't really have that. Just show up around release day: http://techbase.kde.org/Schedules/KDE4/4.11_Release_Schedule
[19:40] <contrast> Will do.
[20:25] <contrast> yofel: Is there an ETA for those Quantal builds? Not trying to rush you or anything, just wondering if I should stop refreshing the page every 5 minutes. :P
[20:26] <yofel> contrast: I'm uploading them now, but this will take a few hours until it's built
[20:28] <contrast> Oh ok. Thanks.
[20:37] <yofel> now they're starting to show up
[20:47] <Noskcaj> Do you guys want me to look at syncing a few of the KTP packages? smartboyhw made a heap of ubuntu deltas that might not be needed
[21:39] <Riddell> Noskcaj: go for it
[22:01] <Noskcaj> Riddell, i don't have time today to file a bug, but ktp-send-file should be synced. The only changes are in the control file, which is just debian having higher package version requirements
[22:06] <Noskcaj> And ktp-text-ui can be synced, it adds many new features and the ubuntu delta was just an upload
[22:35] <contrast> Noskcaj: Are you planning to build those KTP packages for Quantal? I'd be happy to test them if needed.
