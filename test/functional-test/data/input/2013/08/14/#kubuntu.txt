[03:48] <lokem> hi folks, i'm using 13.04 with dell latitude e6430.  everything works fine but somehow the touchpad doesn't respond sometimes.  anyway i can reset the device?
[03:57] <RobertJDohnert_> Have you tried synaptiks
[04:02] <lokem> is that a package in the repo?
[04:04] <valorie> !info synaptiks
[04:04] <ubottu> Package synaptiks does not exist in raring
[04:04] <valorie> huh
[04:05] <valorie> it is, though
[04:07] <lokem> yeah, it is.  but under kde-config-touchpad.  i have it installed and i just ran it.  says there's no touchpad was found in system
[04:08] <valorie> yikes
[04:10] <RobertJDohnert_> Thats what i said, YIKES
[04:11] <lokem> the touchpad works after a reboot, but it just "dies" after a while
[04:11] <lokem> can't pinpoint when and how it hangs {G}
[04:17] <lokem> psmouse serio1: DualPoint TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost sync at byte 1
[04:17] <lokem> psmouse serio1: issuing reconnect request
[04:17] <lokem> mmmm
[04:17] <lokem> that looks suspicious :D

[04:30] <RobertJDohnert> lokem that should help you get your trackpad working
[04:30] <lokem> cool.  let me have a look
[04:36] <Basstard`> 12.04. QtCurve defaults to the oxygen icons for GTK+ programs, like Firefox and Midori. How do I change that to K/Faenza? If I rename /usr/share/icons/oxygen to something else then it uses KFaenza, but I would prefer not to do that.

[06:16] <Okitain> Hi guys, I seem to have a problem with my hybrid AMD card: after installation, neither glxinfo nor amdcccle works.
[06:16] <Okitain> Help, maybe?
[06:17] <Okitain> I have Ubuntu 13.04, on which the default Intel card worked without much of a hitch.
[06:26] <Basstard`> Okitain: You could ask AMD.
[06:31] <Okitain> Basstard`: that's a bit of a hassle, isn't it?
[06:37] <Basstard`> Okitain: Well, they're giving you this hassle in the first place.

[06:41] <Okitain> Basstard`: also, it's only Ubuntu that doesn't configure the drivers right.
[06:44] <Basstard`> Okitain: Intel GPUs work without hitches because they use free drivers. AMD are not friendly with their GPUs.

[08:02] <Nilli> I'm using a Kubuntu 12.04 live usb stick, and I'd like to cancel some printer jobs in cups (http://localhost:631) but cups asks me for authentication and I have no clue what username and password to give it since it's just a live stick. anyone knows?
[08:03] <RamchandraApte> Nilli: try using your username as your password (not sure about livecd username)
[08:04] <RamchandraApte> There's an applet called Manage Print Jobs.
[08:04] <RamchandraApte> (use alt+f2 and type manage print jobs to open the applet)
[08:04] <RamchandraApte> Nakkel: ^
[08:04] <RamchandraApte> *oops, sorry, it should be Nilli: ^
[08:06] <Nilli> nothing comes up in F2 when I type "manage print jobs" so it seems I don't have that applet
[08:06] <Nilli> my home folder is called "kubuntu" so I tried username kubuntu with no password, didn't work. username kubuntu with password kubuntu, didn't work.
[08:07] <RamchandraApte> try alt+f2 and search for printer, there's a configuration module, maybe it'll allow cancelling of jobs
[08:07] <RamchandraApte> I'm pretty sure there's a way to cancel printing jobs.
[08:08] <Nilli> I got to Printer Configuration, but.. oh, ok. found a setting "allow users to cancel any jobs (not just their own)" :)
[08:08] <Nilli> jobs cancelled, thanks :)
[08:09] <RamchandraApte> all I did was alt+f2 and typed print and gave the search results :)
[08:09] <Graf_Westerholt> RamchandraApte :D
[08:09] <Nilli> eh, it's easy to stare yourself blind when you've fixed too many issues at once.. you helped me focus on the right area.

[18:07] <MadEchidna> Hello all
[18:08] <MadEchidna> so I installed Linux 3.11 RC5 on my system, and also uninstalled the Catalyst drivers for my radeon card so I could see how well the open source drivers are working
[18:08] <MadEchidna> they are working quite well, actually, but there's a feature in Virtualbox that I need for work that doesn't work on 3.11 yet
[18:09] <MadEchidna> when I boot to the stock kernel, my video driver doesn't work anymore, I can only use one monitor and it's super low res
[18:09] <MadEchidna> anyone have any suggestions how I can make the stock kernel use gallium correctly?
[18:10] <MadEchidna> I tried forcing dkms to recompile stuff but it only recompiled the virtualbox stuff not the radeon stuff

[18:47] <rd1381> somebody?
[18:48] <chachan> o/
[18:48] <chachan> rd1381, you can change that behavior
[18:48] <rd1381> how?
[18:49] <rd1381> I have nt had seen this behavior before
[18:49] <chachan> rd1381, System Settings > Power Management
[18:49] <rd1381> there is not there?
[18:50] <rd1381> which option?
[18:50] <chachan> Energy Saving, it says "When laptop lid closed"
[18:52] <rd1381> I have selected to lock it
[18:52] <rd1381> but after a while it shtdowns
[18:52] <rd1381> its not duration based
[18:53] <rd1381> cause last not it happened after 5 hours ,today after 20 min
[18:53] <chachan> rd1381, do you have "Suspend Session" activated?. That could be the reason
[18:53] <rd1381> no
[18:55] <chachan> hm, did you check all tabs?, because there're different behaviors if you have AC power connected or not
[19:26] <rd1381>  chachan:yes

[20:52] <eniac_petrov_> Hello guys
[20:52] <eniac_petrov_> do you know the name of the new kde wallet / gnome keyring protocol?
[20:52] <eniac_petrov_> I cannot find info in Google
[20:53] <eniac_petrov_> they must use commont database now
[21:05] <roasted> Hello friends. With the introduction of the 4.11 PPA to 13.04, is there capability to stream videos over Samba without any wizardry?
[21:15] <eniac_petrov_> @roasted Samba is not part of the KDE. I have standart samba server on an old PC as a home server with Ubuntu 12.04 and there's no problem. Even via WIFI
[21:16] <roasted> eniac_petrov_: well, whatever issue I ran into with Samba was exclusive to KDE. That issue doesn't exist on any other DE.
[21:16] <roasted> I'm hoping once my VM is done upgrading that I'll be graced with a 3 year old bug fix. We'll see what happens.
[21:17] <eniac_petrov_> maybe you're trying to play via KIO mount? It's buggy, yeah
[21:18] <roasted> I suppose. I open Dolphin, CTRL + L, smb://ip.to.my.server, and click.
[21:18] <roasted> then, fail. :(
[21:21] <eniac_petrov_> yeah, it must be a KIO problem
[21:22] <roasted> yeah :(
[21:22] <roasted> either way it's qute a headache.
[21:23] <roasted> I'm not sure of an easy way around it.
[21:23] <roasted> It's a pretty big issue for me as I have a massive media server. on other DEs I just click and, bam, I stream the video... so that kind of feature is pretty much required for me.
[21:28] <cornfeedhobo> does anyone know how i can kill a running x11 session? I need to generate a xorg.conf but to do that i need x to not be running... i thought it would be kdm, but that does does not appear to even be here
[21:32] <bprompt> hmm, why do you need an xorg.conf?
[21:34] <cornfeedhobo> 2 reasons. intel graphics + toshiba acpi = no backlight control after suspend.  & i type Dvorak, and use a Yubikey... with xorg.conf you can map the yubikey to always be qwerty so i dont have to switch stpidly
[21:34] <yofel> cornfeedhobo: switch to a tty and stop lightdm (or kdm if release is <= 12.04)
[21:34] <cornfeedhobo> lightdm!
[21:35] <cornfeedhobo> thx i could not remember for my life
[21:35]  * cornfeedhobo just did a clean re-install
[21:36] <yofel> tip: /etc/X11/default-display-manager is a good place to look what's managing X
[21:36] <cornfeedhobo> hmm good to know thanks
[22:18] <AlexZion> hi everyone, today I was trying to run a live Kubuntu 13.04 on a brand new Asus laptop which of course usa the UEFI system, I didn't be able to get the live runs at all, arriving just at a black screen with a horrible Kernel Panic message ...
[22:19] <AlexZion> so now I was  looking for a solution and I guess this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI can be used even for kubuntu ..., someone can comfirm that ?
[22:19] <daniel1> Hi, I want to assign media player shortcut to my right win key, however the right win key is not catched by the shortcuts and gestures configuration
[22:21] <daniel1> I know that there where something I had to set up in some file, but I forgot in which one. But ther is definitly the option to do what I want.
[22:27] <daniel1> hmm xev tells me that my right win key is a menu key. How do i set it to meta_r ?
[22:32] <bprompt> daniel1:  maybe you have the wrong keyboard loaded
[22:32] <bprompt> daniel1:     check in System Settings > input devices > keyboard settings
[22:34] <bprompt> check for another "keyboard model" that may work for your layout
[22:39] <daniel1> bprompt: via xev I have found out that my laptop keyboard and the external keyboard do send different things: altgr -> isoShift3, menu ->menu, ctrl->disabled becaus of vm; my keyboard that is attached has however 4 keys after the space bar:      │ azyr
[22:39] <daniel1>                  | alrgr-> iso3shift; menu->super_r, rwin->menu and the disabled rctrl
[22:42] <bprompt> hmm, can't say :|
[22:42] <daniel1> bprompt: hm failed to paste, ignore the | azyr |, why isn't menu on both keyboars menu
[22:44] <bprompt> daniel1:    keyboard layout loaded for the device, I'd think the module in system settings wouild have something for the two keyboards
[22:46] <daniel1> bprompt: man I never gonna buy a laptop with a missing key again, damn lenovo
[22:48] <daniel1> bprompt: ok different strategy: how do I map menu to meta_r ?
[22:49] <bprompt> missing key? :P    I have an acer and it doesn't have a right winkey either :P
[23:05] <daniel1> bprompt: I found the problem someone played with my keyboard and swapped the keycaps .. man thats geniously evil
[23:05] <bprompt> hehe
