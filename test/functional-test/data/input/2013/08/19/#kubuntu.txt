[02:07] <Roey> tar gives me this when I try and tar an archive:  tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
[02:35] <NanduX> that usually means that the file is corrupted, how are you invoking tar?

[07:25] <bshah> hello! Whick package ships XCB?

[07:26] <ubottu> xcb (source: xcb): Pigeon holes for your cut and paste selections. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.4-4.3 (raring), package size 22 kB, installed size 88 kB
[07:26] <valorie> hmmm, does that answer your question, bshah?
[07:27] <bshah> valorie: I mean xcb libs..
[07:27] <bshah> I want to compile kde-workspace on top of KF5.. and this cmake errors killing me...
[07:28] <valorie> have you tried just using project-neon?
[07:28] <bshah> yes even in it I am getting this error http://paste.kde.org/pd1e6e267/
[07:28] <valorie> they have a kf5 branch, as I recall
[07:29] <bshah> Yup! I am using project-neon5
[07:29] <valorie> ok -- please ask in #project-neon then
[07:29] <valorie> they'll be much more likely to see your question there
[07:30] <bshah> I just wanted to check my side, if I am missing any packages..
[07:30] <valorie> sure
[07:31] <valorie> I wonder if they have a build-dep for kde-workspace
[07:31] <valorie> !info xcb_libraries
[07:31] <ubottu> Package xcb_libraries does not exist in raring

[07:33] <bshah> !info help
[07:33] <ubottu> Package help does not exist in raring
[07:33] <valorie> you might try sudo apt-get build-dep kde-workspace
[07:33] <valorie> and see if that gets you anything
[07:33] <bshah> Irony is I can compile master but not frameworks-scratch..
[07:33] <bshah> :\
[07:36] <valorie> :(
[07:37] <valorie> bshah: have you asked in #kde-core-devel ?
[07:38] <bshah> will ask..
[07:46] <mzanetti> hey, I'm on saucy and after last upgrade, my KWin wouldn't start any more unless I manually export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/lib/x86-linux-gnu/mesa-egl/
[07:47] <valorie> mz
[07:47] <valorie> oops
[07:47] <valorie> mzanetti: there is a #kwin channel
[07:47] <valorie> might do to check with the devels
[07:47] <mzanetti> valorie: this is a Kubuntu issue, not KWin itself
[07:47] <valorie> ok
[07:48] <mzanetti> something in the start up scripts probably
[07:48] <valorie> then I guess filing a bug would be good, if you're sure it's a packaging error
[07:57] <Tm_T> mzanetti: what did get upgraded in last upgrade that led to this issue?
[08:00] <mzanetti> Tm_T: don't know... can't see anything suspicious in the logs
[08:00] <mzanetti> Tm_T: Do you know where this path should be exported?
[08:00] <mzanetti> to be precise, kwin couldn't find libwayland-egl.so.1
[08:01] <mzanetti> which is in /usr/lib/x86-linux-gnu/mesa-egl/
[08:07] <Tm_T> mzanetti: as far as I can see, that variable you mentioned is totally empty here
[08:09] <mzanetti> Tm_T: I think it must be set in the place where kwin is started - only in that context
[08:09] <Tm_T> mzanetti: about packages, /var/log/apt/history.log could propably tell which packages has changed
[08:10] <mzanetti> Tm_T: yeah. I've checked that. I can't really see an upgrade of kwin and libwayland stuff...
[08:15] <mzanetti> Tm_T: hmm... I was wrong. there was an upgrade. however, this is the log: http://paste.kde.org/p2dee9587/
[08:16] <Tm_T> libkwinglesutils sound to be the one that might have something to do with the issue
[08:17] <Tm_T> or glutils
[08:19] <Tm_T> hmh, can't remember the script containing env vals
[08:25] <skreech_> bash_config ?

[09:27] <tkrugg> hello there. can anyone explain me how the sorting in kmenu works. I know you can edit it with kmenuedit and everyting but how does an app end up in one of the entries in the first place?
[09:28] <jussi> tkrugg: when the .desktop file is made by the developer/packager etc there is an entry put in there for which category it should fall into
[09:33] <tkrugg> thanks jussi.  ok, and is there a place I can find this .desktop file in the source of an app (where should it be?)
[09:35] <jussi> tkrugg: if you apt-get source <application> I _think_ it resides in the debian directory
[09:35] <jussi> tkrugg: what are you aiming to do?
[09:36] <jussi> tkrugg: alternately, if you want to edit an app already on your system, I think they are in /usr/share/applications

[11:54] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[12:30] <esing> hi
[12:31] <esing> How should I make my iptable rules persistent in kubuntu? I read about troubles with network manager
[12:40] <ikonia> network manager is nothing to do with iptables
[12:42] <esing> I found a good instruction: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo#Configuration_on_Startup_for_NetworkManager
[12:42] <esing> ikonia, Hm, I read that "If you use NetworkManager (installed by default on Feisty and later) these steps will leave you unable to use NetworkManager for the interfaces you modify. Please follow the steps in the next section instead. "
[12:44] <ikonia> esing: I don't think you'll have a problem
[12:44] <ikonia> esing: the sort of problem described only happens if iptables rules are applied before the network controlled by network manager is up
[12:49] <esing> ikonia, I see, to be safe I can still use the NetworkManager script from latter link?
[12:50] <ikonia> esing: I would just try it, and fix it if it's broken, leave it alone if it works
[12:50] <ikonia> no sense trying to fix something that's not broken

[15:00] <grosse> Why are the initial xorgs .confs in /usr/share and not in /etc?
[15:01] <grosse> The man pages state several locations where these files are searched from, but it doesn't mention /usr/share
[15:01] <grosse> So are the ones under /usr/share used at all or are they some sort of templates only?
[15:02] <Pici> They're templates.
[15:02] <Pici> They're not supposed to be sourced by xorg by default.
[15:05] <grosse> Ok. Thanks. So from the beginning my system hasn't got any .conf-files in use for Xorg. Only those I choose to place under /etc/X11

[15:47] <grosse> I'm about to know whether my configs work.
[15:47] <grosse> Usually not but I'm feeling lucky
[15:49] <esing> In /etc/default/locale I wrote LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 and LC_MESSAGES=POSIX. In system settings I set the locale prefered languagea to german, and moved english to not prefered. Yet if I type: locale it shows LANG=de_US.UTF-8 which doesn't exist 
[15:51] <grosse> Sure it didn't
[15:52] <grosse> I have LTCornerButton set to 7 in .conf and synclient says its 3
[16:08] <esing> Hm, I removed the english language pack, reinstalled the german language pack for kde. Edited manually locale with export locale LANG=de.DE.UTF-8 and export locale LANGUAGE=de , then dkpg-reconfigured the locales and rebooted, but still on every startup the LANGUAGE is again: de:en and LANG=de_US.UTF-8
[16:08] <esing> Pretty weird
[16:09] <esing> I could add in .bashrc export locale LANG=de_DE.UTF-8, but I guess that doesn't solve the root bug

[22:34] <GiGaHuRtZ> Anyone able to help me out? I had some big distro problems last night that I ended up fixing, but I am having some issues since then I am trying to fix. First one is that every time I try add-apt-repository, I ge4t the normal info prompt about the ppa, and it says press enter and it crashes with this traceback: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6004533/
[22:34] <GiGaHuRtZ> I have no idea how to diagnose such an error really unfortunately
[22:40] <GiGaHuRtZ> My second issue is I seem to have broken my package manager a bit,  whenever I try to install any wine type packages, like wine itself, or netflix-desktop which has some wine deps, I get an error like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6004547/
[22:40] <GiGaHuRtZ> But it doesn't say how to correct the issue
[22:46] <GiGaHuRtZ> Man I am really considering just backing up most of my $HOME, and re-installing. But I really don't want to, I have put a lot of work into this setup this far.
[22:46] <GiGaHuRtZ> sithlord48: you around?
[22:46] <sithlord48> i am
[22:47] <GiGaHuRtZ> Any chance you could take a look at those two issues?
[22:47] <GiGaHuRtZ> They popped up after I fixed that other stuff from last night apparently
[22:48] <sithlord48> GiGaHuRtZ:  where does your wine come from?
[22:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> ppa's
[22:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> but thats besides the point
[22:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> desktop-netflix doesnt work either
[22:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> its a dependency issue somewhere in there
[22:49] <sithlord48> because you can't get wine installed? 
[22:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> nah
[22:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> netflix-desktop has its own wine
[22:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> one sec
[22:50] <GiGaHuRtZ> The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[22:50] <GiGaHuRtZ>  netflix-desktop : Depends: wine-browser-installer (= 0.8.2~raring) but it is not going to be installed
[22:50] <GiGaHuRtZ>                    Depends: wine-silverlight4-installer but it is not going to be installed
[22:51] <sithlord48> sounds like missing packages. but i don't know about wine much very little use of it even
[22:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> ya its very odd
[22:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> I try to install those seperately
[22:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> and get problems about other packages
[22:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> but usually there is an easy way to fix this crap
[22:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> all this was working fine before last night
[22:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> and the painful removal of deepin
[22:52] <sithlord48> dpkg --configure -a ? 
[22:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> tried
[22:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> does nothing
[22:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> same with -f install
[22:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> and muon doesnt know what to do 
[22:52] <sithlord48> then you don't have broken packages , you are asking for an inpossible install 
[22:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> right
[22:52] <sithlord48> i can't help you with that it must be some issue w/ another ppa (or two) 
[22:53] <GiGaHuRtZ> The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[22:53] <GiGaHuRtZ>  wine-silverlight4-installer : Depends: wine-browser-installer (= 0.8.2~raring) but it is not going to be installed
[22:53] <GiGaHuRtZ> its a big frickin circle
[22:54] <GiGaHuRtZ> and I have a feeling its because all my ppas are messed up now
[22:54] <GiGaHuRtZ> look at my first issue
[22:54] <GiGaHuRtZ> Googling parts of it say something about an unset distro or some crap
[22:55] <GiGaHuRtZ> like if I google line 10 of that first paste
[22:55] <sithlord48> maybe thats your problem you broke the distro id

[22:57] <GiGaHuRtZ> There are at least 4 blogs recommending people try this crap
[22:57] <sithlord48> very true
[22:57] <sithlord48> well glad i was able to help :P
[22:57] <GiGaHuRtZ> sithlord48: well i dont know how to actually fix that
[22:57] <GiGaHuRtZ> do you?
[22:58] <GiGaHuRtZ> its obviously broke by doing a "lsb_release -a"
[22:58] <GiGaHuRtZ> looks like some file like this: /usr/share/python-apt/templates/Ubuntu.info
[22:58] <GiGaHuRtZ> or such
[22:59] <GiGaHuRtZ> that file looks correct
[23:00] <GiGaHuRtZ> I have 3 templates in there oddly
[23:00] <GiGaHuRtZ> debian ubuntu and gnewsense
[23:00] <sithlord48> thats all i've got too 
[23:01] <GiGaHuRtZ> and i just broke my phone again by accident too, yay
[23:01] <GiGaHuRtZ> lol
[23:01] <sithlord48> GiGaHuRtZ:  has to know its ubuntu before it can use the Ubuntu.info file..
[23:01] <GiGaHuRtZ> Thats what I get for not using an external memory card. At least I have a usb OTG and my recovery supports usb-otg
[23:01] <GiGaHuRtZ> right
[23:01] <GiGaHuRtZ> i dont understand these threads i linked
[23:02] <sithlord48> you said its dreebin raring. 
[23:02] <GiGaHuRtZ> illl show you
[23:02] <GiGaHuRtZ> one sec
[23:04] <GiGaHuRtZ> wonder if i edit the lsb release file manually
[23:04] <GiGaHuRtZ> http://pastebin.com/Suntu7PW
[23:04] <GiGaHuRtZ> check that
[23:05] <sithlord48> maybe its part of that ubuntu.info file then
[23:05] <GiGaHuRtZ> nope
[23:05] <GiGaHuRtZ> nothing in there says deepin
[23:05] <GiGaHuRtZ> i checked
[23:05] <GiGaHuRtZ> but lsb release comes from a different file
[23:05] <GiGaHuRtZ> and there is also a package
[23:05] <GiGaHuRtZ> lsb-base
[23:06] <GiGaHuRtZ> but its newest version...
[23:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> im gonna manually reinstall, without removing it
[23:07] <sithlord48> looks like lsb_release uses /etc/lsb-release for that info
[23:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> yup
[23:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> i know
[23:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> thats typical linux
[23:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> if you ever wanna know what distro you are on, you look there
[23:08] <GiGaHuRtZ> hmm
[23:08] <GiGaHuRtZ> so whats your file say?
[23:09] <sithlord48> this http://pastebin.com/dfsjf0J5
[23:09] <GiGaHuRtZ> oh there is a lsb release file
[23:09] <GiGaHuRtZ> lemme try that
[23:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> cause lsb-base does nothing
[23:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> thanks
[23:10] <sithlord48> /etc/lsb-release
[23:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> yup
[23:11] <GiGaHuRtZ> hmm reinstalling lsb-release didnt change it
[23:11] <GiGaHuRtZ> oh well, gonna manually edit the thing
[23:11] <sithlord48> thats what i thougth you were doing already ?
[23:11] <GiGaHuRtZ> no, i was trying some packages that have to do with that file
[23:12] <GiGaHuRtZ> hoping they might fix things
[23:12] <GiGaHuRtZ> now the question is, do I need to reboot or something for any changes (if any even happen from doing this) to take effect
[23:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> sithlord48: that fixed it
[23:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> :)
[23:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> at least the ppa adding problem
[23:13] <sithlord48> and perhaps more.. 
[23:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> i think it did
[23:14] <GiGaHuRtZ> Man, I hadx to really take the flame thrower to deepin
[23:14] <GiGaHuRtZ> the chinese were hax0ring my machine :P
[23:14] <sithlord48> lol 
[23:14] <GiGaHuRtZ> hmm, those packages still dont wanna install
[23:14] <GiGaHuRtZ> but that might just need an update to apt
[23:14] <sithlord48> you might want to redo ppas and stuff. 
[23:14] <GiGaHuRtZ> right
[23:15] <sithlord48> if update apt is not working.. also check you sources for the right repo ids
[23:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> ie apt-get update
[23:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> no update always worked
[23:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> i donno if its gonna fix it though

[23:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> or y-ppa-manager
[23:15] <sithlord48> what ever you want to use. 
[23:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> or just edit it by hand
[23:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> they all sit in sources.d
[23:16] <sithlord48> well by hand might be annoying becuase there are now alot of files to edit in there.
[23:16] <GiGaHuRtZ> hmm, still broken, so weird
[23:16] <GiGaHuRtZ> nah cause the codename is still the same
