[00:11] <manchicken> Whattaya know, it looks like the repartioning worked.
[00:11] <manchicken> Color me surprised.
[00:24] <manchicken> Argh... I guess it's not working.
=== kubuntu is now known as Guest4600
[01:33] <manchicken> Sometimes it seems like getting a usable dev environment takes more time than the code changes themselves.
[01:42] <manchicken> JontheEchidna: Howdy
[01:42] <JontheEchidna> manchicken: hi
[01:49] <manchicken> JontheEchidna: I'm finally back on libqapt and kubuntu-debug-installer. I'm wondering if you have a changelog for the most recent commits.
[02:09] <JontheEchidna> manchicken: I've not done much since I added the dup-check to SourcesList. Been a bit busy since my employment ended, I'm afraid...
[02:09] <manchicken> I saw you did an update to the actions.
[02:09] <JontheEchidna> oh, that's probably automated changes to the translation files by the translation team
[02:10] <manchicken> JontheEchidna: I'm sorry to hear you're out of work... that kinda sucks.
[02:10] <JontheEchidna> yeah...
[02:10] <JontheEchidna> Well, school starts back up a week from tomorrow. I'll try to get another prerelese out this week.
[02:11] <JontheEchidna> Sucks, but not the end of the world. I have a few leads at uni that I'm trying to follow
[02:11] <manchicken> JontheEchidna: I've been hanging backed off of Kubuntu stuff for a while since I've been trying to switch jobs.
[02:11] <manchicken> JontheEchidna: Do you have any changes to the removal stuff that you haven't released yet?
[02:12] <JontheEchidna> Not to my knowledge\
[02:12] <JontheEchidna> there was a bug where sources entries not in the main /etc/apt/sources.list file would not be removed before re-reading all the sources fiels?
[02:12] <JontheEchidna> since the SourcesList object wasn't notified of the new files?
[02:13] <JontheEchidna> (iirc)
[02:13] <manchicken> Yes
[02:14] <JontheEchidna> Ok. I'll see about taking care of that too before 2.1 is released
[02:14] <manchicken> I'm trying to set up my VirtualBox instance for play, but it's taking a while.
[02:17] <JontheEchidna> I had an early day today, so I'm going to hop off on to bed now.
[02:23] <manchicken> Righto, later.
[05:32] <Tm_T> time to burn ppc image of saucy and see if it boots after install, hmmm
[07:31] <TheOneRing> I think I will add ffmpeg transcoding support to the next amarok windows install, can sombody advise me how to best handle the mp3lame issue? just ship it? make it somehow optional and make the user select it in the installer?
[07:31] <TheOneRing> maybe a kubuntu packager can help me :)
[07:34] <valorie> TheOneRing: early Mon. morning for most of 'em -- you might write to the kubuntu-devel list
[07:35] <valorie> that would be really cool, IMO
[07:35] <TheOneRing> kk thx
[07:35] <jussi> TheOneRing: we have an installer that pops up when an MP3 is tried to be played first time. No idea how you could do that in windows though
[07:35] <valorie> I still have a win install on this laptop so someday I can build and check amarok on it
[07:35] <TheOneRing> jussi: the thing is Im not sure about hosting deploying etc 
[07:36] <TheOneRing> only that lame is fishy :P
[07:36] <jussi> TheOneRing: ahh, yeah, not sure about that (you can see something about the feature here: http://community.kde.org/Amarok/Archives/MP3:Kubuntu_6.10 )
[07:37] <TheOneRing> kk thx
[07:37] <jussi> TheOneRing: I think the stuff is in our multiverse repo, but for other things, we have a direct download - have a look at the flashplugin package for exampler
[07:39] <TheOneRing> maybe I should just use a 3party build binary and make it somehow optional dont know
[07:39] <jussi> TheOneRing: yeah, maybe
[07:40] <jussi> but ask in #kde-devel also, methinks

[08:58] <vassie> Hello Riddell
[08:58] <vassie> Morning all
[09:00] <vassie> @Riddell I've updated my Cantata package and uploaded it to my PPA https://launchpad.net/~vassie/+archive/ppa
[09:00] <Riddell> oh hi vassie 
[09:00] <Riddell> sorry I should have looked into that, I'll do so now
[09:00] <apachelogger> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/19/plasma-desktopDj2376.png
[09:01] <apachelogger> oh, where's mister cake?
[09:01] <vassie> @Riddell no worries, thank you
[09:08] <Tm_T> apachelogger: nicely all in german?
[09:09] <apachelogger> [10:30:37] <apachelogger> ---------------->>> l10n review <<<----------------
[09:09] <apachelogger> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/19/plasma-desktopuD2376.png is it me or is that a non-oxygen color on the progress bar?
[09:10] <valorie> I've never seen that color in KDE before
[09:11] <Riddell> vassie: why this change? http://paste.kde.org/pdd2730bc/
[09:11] <valorie> http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Oxygen/Style#Color_Usage
[09:11] <valorie> maybe that's the middle blue in vibrant
[09:13] <apachelogger> well it's not the progressbar color anyway
[09:13] <Riddell> vassie: you added empty README.Debian and README.source files?
[09:13] <apachelogger> ubiquity actually as another visual identity problem WRT oxygen
[09:13] <apachelogger> totally not sure why though
[09:13] <apachelogger> e.g. the language dropdown has a white background
[09:13] <vassie> Riddell: That CMake option was replaced https://code.google.com/p/cantata/source/browse/release/1.1.0/INSTALL
[09:14] <vassie> Riddell: I pulled down the source for 1.0.3 then updated it
[09:14] <apachelogger> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/19/002.png
[09:14] <apachelogger> oh actually that may be oxygenish after all, the scollbar makes it look weird
[09:15] <apachelogger> and color again is darker
[09:15] <apachelogger> something overrides the scheme
[09:15] <apachelogger> :(
[09:18] <apachelogger> Riddell: is it known that in saucy one cannot reboot from lightdm?
[09:18] <apachelogger> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/19/plasma-desktopbm2376.png
[09:20] <apachelogger> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/19/plasma-desktopJN2376.png l10n fail
[09:27] <apachelogger> Riddell: I am having a lot of problems with discover
[09:28] <Riddell> apachelogger: hmm I've not noticed the no reboot issue before but I do have it too
[09:29] <Riddell> apachelogger: what's up with Muon Discover?
[09:29] <apachelogger> solid/logind/upstart madness I suppose
[09:29] <Riddell> besides the l10n fail
[09:29] <apachelogger> l10n fail is pretty substantial :P
[09:29] <Riddell> but fixable I hope. JontheEchidna?
[09:30] <apachelogger> let me past them real quick
[09:30] <apachelogger> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/19/discover-not-localized.png
[09:30] <apachelogger> main banner graphic is not localized and I hope you have a plan on how to make it localized because that seems not so trivial
[09:30] <apachelogger> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/19/discover-empty-without-internet.png
[09:31] <apachelogger> that's non-l10n..... if you have no intartubes access the startup banner will move for white space
[09:31] <apachelogger> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/19/discover-icon-size.png
[09:31] <Riddell> apachelogger: my plan to make it localised is not to include text in it
[09:32] <Riddell> apachelogger: and to use local files for the banner
[09:32] <apachelogger> the icons here have different size, different spacing from the text, and they are different icon styles, one's oxygen the other is monochrome oxygen or something
[09:32] <apachelogger> Riddell: sounds good
[09:32] <apachelogger> most importantlty right now though http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/19/discover-quick-switch-confuses-tabs.png
[09:33] <apachelogger> if you keep switching through the tabs (particularly to the sources) at some point discover gets confused and stops switching alltogether
[09:33] <apachelogger> e.g. in the screenshot it is displaying sources but the installed tab is selected
[09:33] <apachelogger> I can reproduce this all the time
[09:33] <apachelogger> only way to recover is to restart discover
[09:34] <Riddell> it's almost like you're looking for bugs
[09:35] <apachelogger> no, I was going through the tabs to see if there were untranslated strings
[09:35] <apachelogger> i.e. I don't even have to do it repeatedly
[09:35] <Riddell> mm yes I agree
[09:35] <apachelogger> go to installed, go to sources, start sources setup, cancel kdesudo -> discover broken
[09:35] <Riddell> but poke JontheEchidna on that one (politely)
[09:35] <apachelogger> that's the kind of thing that will get us a bad review ^^
