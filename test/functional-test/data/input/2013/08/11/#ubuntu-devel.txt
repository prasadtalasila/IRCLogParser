[09:35] <rkalff> Can someone explain to me how you would normally create a patch for a package?
[09:36] <rkalff> I branched a ppa with bzr branch ubuntu:somepackage
[09:36] <rkalff> And tried to create a patch with edit-patch as in de ubuntu packaging manual
[09:37] <rkalff> But that doesn't work, saying things like "no series file found"

[19:06] <JViz> i made a pcap.pc file for libpcap, is there somewhere I can submit it?
[19:06] <sergiusens> cjwatson: hey, if you are around, can you tell me for whom is the Path entry intended in the desktop click hook?
[19:06] <JViz> er, libpcap 1.1.1
[19:07] <jtaylor> JViz: the best place is the libpcap developers

[19:40] <fossterer> hi ! I'm trying to understand what goes into bug fixing.. got a simple bug which was recently resolved..
[19:41] <Ampelbein> fossterer: What do you mean? You want to know how to fix a bug?
[19:42] <fossterer> Ampelbein: Heyy I saw the debdiff.. and I would like to see the changes it brings
[19:42] <fossterer> I've not updated my system so as to apply that myself
[19:42] <fossterer> and check
[19:42] <Ampelbein> fossterer: You can open a debdiff in any editor, it's basically just a patch file.
[19:42] <fossterer> ok.. thhen
[19:43] <fossterer> ?
[19:43] <Ampelbein> fossterer: Then you can see the changes made. This topic is more appropriate for #ubuntu-packaging or #ubuntu-motu though.
[19:45] <fossterer> Ampelbein: Please don't get me wrong... My aim is to not accept the updates pushed to my system; rather implement those code changes (10 lines) myself and see it working
[19:47] <Ampelbein> fossterer: You can see in the debdiff what was changed, apply those changes to the source and build the software.
[19:48] <Ampelbein> fossterer: http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/traditional-packaging.html#applying-a-debdiff
[20:00] <fossterer> Ampelbein: Cool.. thanks. The bug was related to 'gnome-screenshot'.. So should I download its source first?
[20:00] <fossterer> and apply this debdiff to see the changes?
[20:02] <Ampelbein> fossterer: Yes. But as I said earlier, that topic is borderline OT here and should be better discussed in #ubuntu-packaging.
[20:04] <fossterer> Ampelbein: I'm sorry for that.. Is this channel about any core development?
[20:04] <fossterer> In that case could you suggest someone to ask in #ubuntu-packaging?
[20:04] <fossterer> *somene for me to approach
[20:05] <Ampelbein> fossterer: Just ask your questions in the channel. Someone will answer.
[20:05] <Ampelbein> !packaging | fossterer
[20:05] <ubottu> fossterer: The packaging guide is at http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/  - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages for information on getting a package integrated into Ubuntu - Other developer resources are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment - See also !backports and !sponsoring
[20:05] <Ampelbein> fossterer: But read that first.
[20:05] <fossterer> Ampelbein: thank you

[20:54] <cjwatson> sergiusens: sort of required to make the click package work at all; since click packages don't have a fixed unpack path, the app inside them needs to be executed with its current working directory set to the unpack directory so that it knows where to find its own assets; and of course qtubuntu needs to know where to execute it from too
[20:57] <sergiusens> cjwatson: ok, so something is missing, I had to add the full path to the qml (for qmlscene) in the desktop file http://paste.ubuntu.com/5974964/
[20:58] <cjwatson> sergiusens: You shouldn't have had to hardcode the path in Icon either
[20:58] <cjwatson> sergiusens: bug 1204596
[20:58] <ubottu> bug 1204596 in qtubuntu (Ubuntu) "Unity 8 does not honor Path= in desktop files" [Undecided,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1204596
[20:59] <sergiusens> cjwatson: let me look at that bug. thanks!
[20:59] <sergiusens> cjwatson: I didn't hardcode the Icon path btw....
[20:59] <cjwatson> sergiusens: Oh, that's right, click desktophook currently does that
[21:00] <cjwatson> Never mind that comment then
[21:00] <sergiusens> yup, I'm looking at it now, was going to paste the snippet
[21:00] <sergiusens> let me see if I can fix the qtubuntu bug
[21:00] <cjwatson> The bug already has a branch attached
[21:00] <sergiusens> ah, yeah, I'll review/test
[22:19] <lifeless> so why does ubuntu installer create subvolumes for /home ?
