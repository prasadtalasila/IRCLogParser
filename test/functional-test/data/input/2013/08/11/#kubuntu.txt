[09:57] <floown> hello
[09:57] <floown> I can not installer MySql, I have this error : http://pastebin.com/ZbhuPkyt
[09:59] <floown> * install
[10:01] <tsimpson> floown: you may want to make sure you don't have raring-proposed (Pre-released updates) enabled in your sources
[10:02] <floown> tsimpson: witch line I add to my sources.list please?
[10:03] <tsimpson> check for one with raring-proposed and make sure it's commented out
[10:09] <floown> tsimpson: I have this line in my sources.list : deb-src http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-proposed main restricted universe multiverse
[10:10] <tsimpson> floown: do you have one with "deb" instead of "deb-src" too?
[10:10] <floown> deb http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-proposed main restricted universe multiverse
[10:11] <floown> tsimpson: the two lines
[10:11] <tsimpson> ok, comment both of those out
[10:11] <tsimpson> just put # at the beginning of both lines
[10:11] <floown> ok
[10:12] <tsimpson> then run "sudo apt-get update" and see if that fixes the problem you had
[10:16] <floown> tsimpson: the problem is the same

[10:18] <tsimpson> floown: ok, can you pastebin the output of "dpkg -l | grep mysql"

=== SJrX is now known as SJr
[10:34] <floown> tsimpson: any idea?
[10:34] <tsimpson> floown: it looks like you upgraded part of the system from -proposed, so you'll have to downgrade the packages.
[10:34] <tsimpson> floown: try "sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient18:amd64=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 libmysqlclient18:i386=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-client=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-client-5.5=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-client-core-5.5=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-common=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-server-5.5=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-server-core-5.5=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1"
[10:34] <tsimpson> that should force apt to download and install the right versions, I hope
[10:34] <tsimpson> (it'll either work or apt will complain)
[10:36] <floown> tsimpson: it seems working, the installation has beging
[10:37] <tsimpson> good
[10:37] <tsimpson> it's generally not a good idea to enable -proposed unless you're testing a specific fix, it can cause problems like you have
[10:49] <floown> tsimpson: it works!
[10:49] <floown> Thx
[10:50] <tsimpson> no problem, glad you got it fixed

[20:08] <Costeelation> kubuntu 13.04 have support until when
[20:09] <DarthFrog> Costeelation: 18 months after release.
[20:09] <Costeelation> Thank u :)
[20:09] <DarthFrog> So Oct. 2014.
[20:09] <Costeelation> perfect
[20:10] <DarthFrog> Costeelation: the LTS releases have 3 year support on the desktop.  Last LTS release was 12.04, next one is 14.04.
[20:37] <yofel> DarthFrog: that is not quite correct. 10.04 had 3 years, 12.04 has 5 years, 12.10 was the last release with 18months, 13.04 and any future non-LTS has 9months support
[20:38] <DarthFrog> yofel:  Thanks.  I wasn't aware of the shortening of the support period.
[20:38] <yofel> see also https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
[20:38] <DarthFrog> yofel:  12.04 has 5 years support on the desktop?  Wow.
[20:39] <yofel> the shortening came out of the rolling release discussion.
[20:40] <yofel> as it lowers the workload on the security team and nobody really needed 18 months
[20:40] <DarthFrog> :-)  I don't need 18 months.  Six months is fine with me.
[20:41] <gits1225> Wait till you get old, even 5 years is short
[20:41] <DarthFrog> gits1225:  I am old!  Damn it. :-)  1952 was to long ago.
[20:42] <gits1225> ... I am defeated, I have nothing to say
[20:42] <yofel> 6 was discussed. But many people don't upgrade on day 1 so it's bad to leave them completely unsupported
[20:42] <DarthFrog> yofel:  So, going forward: 9 months support for non-LTS, 5 years for LTS on the desktop.  Is that right?
[20:43] <yofel> pretty much, though with all the changes we had recently I can't say how long that'll hold. It's the plan for 13.10 and 14.04 at least
[20:43] <DarthFrog> I usually upgrade to the RC of the next release.
[20:44] <DarthFrog> I bleed too much on the cutting edge. ;-)
[20:44] <gits1225> Why not archlinux then DarthFrog? Genuine question.
[20:45] <DarthFrog> gits1225:  I've never tried it and know nothing about it.  I used to distro-hop all the time, compile my own kernel, etc.  But that got old.  I settled on Kubuntu and haven't had any reason to change my mind.
[20:46] <DarthFrog> I like Debian and KDE.  So Kubuntu is a natural for me.
[20:46] <gits1225> Give archlinux a spin when you get the time, you may like it.
[20:46] <gits1225> Kubuntu LTS is my main desktop, but archlinux runs on all my other stuff
[20:46] <gits1225> ofcouse with KDE
[20:46] <DarthFrog> gits1225:  Kubuntu current release is my desktop OS.  CentOS runs our servers.
[20:47] <gits1225> hmm
