[11:15] <d_ed> hey, can someone do me a favour.
[11:15] <d_ed> can someone run ldd /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/ktp-call-ui  | pastebinit on stock kubuntu
[11:16] <d_ed> and send me the output of course :)
[11:30] <yofel> d_ed: http://pastebin.com/Xx38v59x on kubuntu 13.10 and ktp-call-ui 0.6.3-0ubuntu1
[11:35] <d_ed> perfect
[11:36] <d_ed> ooh and this is right. It's just my local setup that's screwed
[11:36] <d_ed> thanks
[12:30] <smartboyhw> Hey guys.
[12:30] <smartboyhw> Oh no, my Developer application is tmr, real nervous...
[14:08] <smartboyhw> yofel, do you have time to review plasma-mediacenter 1.0.95 package?
[14:10] <yofel> hm, can do
[14:10] <smartboyhw> yofel, https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/packaging-staging-1/+files/plasma-mediacenter_1.0.95-0ubuntu1.dsc
[14:11] <yofel> already got it from the backlog
[14:11] <smartboyhw> yofel, great:)
[14:12] <smartboyhw> yofel, uh, my dev application is tmr (HORROR HORROR HORROR, as in the Macbeth line)
[14:13] <smartboyhw> In case if you are wondering why did I update the copyright file, it's because I bugged upstream about the dual-headers and they fixed it
[14:13] <yofel> ah nice
[14:14] <yofel> meh, spend some time trying to get icecc working. After taking the package from sid it at least runs, but only builds locally
[14:15] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh
[14:17] <smartboyhw> I'm trying to port my device (GALAXY Pocket) to CM
[14:17] <smartboyhw> But I can't seem to get mtp working
[14:19]  * yofel ponders whether what upstream did is legal.
[14:19] <yofel> I'm no relicensing expert...
[14:20] <yofel> it's their issue anyway
[14:22] <smartboyhw> yofel, yeah
[14:22] <yofel> uploaded
[14:23] <smartboyhw> yofel, \o/
[14:48] <Quintasan> \o
[14:48] <smartboyhw> Hello Quintasan 
[14:51] <Quintasan> yofel: I'm going to delete some buffers in Quassel now so things might go strange in the load I gues
[14:51] <Quintasan> :P
[14:51] <yofel> please delete them one at a time
[15:24] <smartboyhw> yofel, \o/ plasma-mediacenter is now in raring-release;)
[15:51] <Quintasan> well
[15:51] <Quintasan> crap
[15:51] <Quintasan> yofel: Sorry
[15:51] <yofel> Quintasan: what happened? I was fine
[15:54] <Quintasan> yofel: Oh lol, I'm getting disconnected each time I delete one.
[15:54] <Quintasan> If you're not getting hit by it then I'll keep it up
[15:55] <yofel> weird, I thought it would lock the whole DB table, seems it doesn't
[16:01] <Quintasan> I mass spammed delete requests and thought it killed the server
[16:12] <Quintasan> yofel: Well, anyways, my db should be considerably smaller
[16:19] <markey> where are the monochromatic icons from the system tray located?
[16:21] <markey> nvm
[16:23] <markey> or actually... do mind ;)
[16:24] <Quintasan> markey: Uh, they should be in /usr/share/icons I believe
[16:24] <markey> hmm
[16:25] <markey> I'm confused, can't find the monochrome amarok icon
[16:25] <markey> only the blue one that we bundle
[16:31] <yofel> markey: /usr/share/kde4/apps/desktoptheme/default/icons/amarok.svgz
[16:31] <yofel> might be what you're looking for
[16:31] <yofel> (from kde-runtime)
[16:31] <yofel> (-data)
[16:31] <markey> ah
[16:32] <markey> thanks
[17:08] <shadeslayer> yofel: do you know where the various debhelper variables are documented?
[17:08] <shadeslayer> a quick google didn't find anything
[17:09] <yofel> no, not really
[17:10] <shadeslayer> okay, any ideas what the top level source folder is refered to as?
[17:12] <shadeslayer> this source has a whole bunch of shell scripts and desktop files and no CMakeLists.txt file
[17:12] <shadeslayer> hm, actually, I think it'll be easier to write a cmake file
