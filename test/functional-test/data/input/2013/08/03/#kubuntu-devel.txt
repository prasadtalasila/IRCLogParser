[02:36] <manchicken> apachelogger: I haven't foresaken you.
[02:36] <manchicken> apachelogger: I'm just crazy busy. I got a ridiculous (the good kind) interview process going which is taking a bunch of time.
[04:25] <ghostburner> on kde plasma desktop I have 2 desktop managers running so I have 2 task bars from plasma, and 2 from the default Kali and the default one will not go away anyone have a clue how to stop this?
[07:36] <shadeslayer> -.-
[07:36] <shadeslayer> try living without internet for 2 days
[07:36] <shadeslayer> you go crazy
[08:26] <smartboyhw> How's everyone?
[08:29] <yofel> *yawn*
[08:29] <yofel> sleepy after staying up till 5am -.-
[08:30] <smartboyhw> Hmm, okular failed in quantal
[08:30] <smartboyhw> Install file problems? :O
[08:30] <smartboyhw> The dependencies are NOT missing
[08:31] <yofel> because the hook removed the dep on plasma-active-dev but doesn't fix the install files
[08:31] <smartboyhw> yofel, ouch
[08:32] <smartboyhw> yofel, maybe I should backport plasma-active-dev hahahahaha
[08:32] <smartboyhw> (LOL)
[08:32] <smartboyhw> Ofc not la
[08:32] <yofel> you could help me with ktux and kget on precise, would probably be easier
[08:32] <yofel> the hw enablement stack is a fearsome opponent though
[08:32] <smartboyhw> yofel, hey I want to deal with Quantal:P
[08:33] <smartboyhw> What happened BTW?
[08:33] <yofel> dependency issues with the mesa backports
[08:33] <smartboyhw> yofel, ;O
[08:33] <smartboyhw> NOT GOOD
[08:34] <yofel> http://paste.kde.org/p5bb206ed/
[08:34] <smartboyhw> OH HOLY
[08:34] <smartboyhw> Meh
[08:35] <yofel> (that's apt-get -o debug::pkgproblemresolver=1 if you haven't seen it yet)
[08:35] <smartboyhw> I think dealing with active-documentviewer might be easier:P
[08:36] <yofel> probably ;)
[08:36] <smartboyhw> yofel, which one is better? Backport active or delete the entire active-documentviewer binary?
[08:36] <smartboyhw> I think you will say the latter one:P
[08:36] <yofel> latter
[08:36] <smartboyhw> Yes, I got it correct!
[08:36] <smartboyhw> LOL
[08:38] <smartboyhw> yofel, what happened to the file I gave to you for the -dbg file?
[08:38] <smartboyhw> I mean, the package, sorry:P
[08:38] <yofel> drat, I forgot about it, sorry
[08:39] <smartboyhw> yofel, no worries, it isn't an emergency:P
[08:41] <smartboyhw> okular done
[08:48] <yofel> smartboyhw: took a quick look at plasma-mediacenter. Can't really see anything wrong so just leave it
[08:48] <smartboyhw> yofel, upload it then?:P
[08:51] <smartboyhw> Now I have to deal with the Calligra precise backport, sigh
[08:51] <yofel> later, first I'll have some breakfast and need to go shopping
[08:51] <smartboyhw> yofel, sure
[08:52] <smartboyhw> OH NO
[08:52] <smartboyhw> Calligra 2.7.1 in 13.04 missing depedency: gcc-4.7 :O
[08:52] <smartboyhw> g++-4.7 sorry
[08:52] <smartboyhw> But, MEH MEH
[08:54] <smartboyhw> Oops, 12.04:P
[08:54] <smartboyhw> Anyways, still MEH
[08:56] <smartboyhw> Anyone know what can I do with it?
[09:18] <yofel> brrrrr
[09:18] <yofel> File kubuntu-meta_1.285.tar.gz already exists in Primary Archive for Ubuntu, but uploaded version has different contents. See more information about this error in https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/UploadErrors.
[09:19] <smartboyhw> yofel, :O
[09:19] <smartboyhw> yofel, how do you deal with the above prob?
[09:19] <yofel> not quite sure
[09:20] <smartboyhw> yofel, I mean, the Calligra one
[09:20] <yofel> ah
[09:20] <yofel> well, try to switch to 4.6 and see if it builds?
[09:20] <yofel> maybe it requires c++11 stuff, then it won't
[09:22] <yofel> [ubuntu/saucy-proposed] mir 0.0.8+13.10.20130803-0ubuntu1 (Accepted)
[09:23] <yofel> at least they didn't wait till final freeze like usual
[09:28] <smartboyhw> yofel, LOL
[09:28] <yofel> kubuntu-meta 1.286 up (including the deleted 1.285)
[09:29] <smartboyhw> yofel, \o/
[09:29] <yofel> with that your amarok removal should be complete
[09:29] <smartboyhw> yofel, thx
[09:31] <smartboyhw> OK, now let's see how Calligra breaks down with G++ and GCC 4.6 :P
[09:39] <smartboyhw> I think I may have just made the i386 build queue a bit too busy:P
[09:41] <smartboyhw> yofel, I don't think you can build calligra WITHOUT G++ 4.7
[09:41] <smartboyhw> So, I declare NO backport for 12.04
[09:41] <yofel> no 2.7 for precise then
[09:42] <smartboyhw> Riddell, you want a announcement?
[09:42] <smartboyhw> :P
[09:42] <yofel> he's on vacation
[09:43] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh oh
[09:43] <smartboyhw> Anyways, I can do it myself
[09:43] <smartboyhw> Hmm, not yet.
[09:43] <smartboyhw> 12.10 still not working (it builds, but install files probably)
[09:45] <shadeslayer> I'm rich \o/

[09:45] <shadeslayer> hurray
[09:45] <shadeslayer> now I can make a kubuntu phone
[09:45] <shadeslayer> :P
[09:45] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, BAH
[09:45] <smartboyhw> :P
[09:46] <shadeslayer> but dude
[09:46] <shadeslayer> I'm rich now xD
[09:46]  * shadeslayer is super sleepy after a heavy lunch
[09:47] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, what did you eat?
[09:48] <shadeslayer> something that cannot be expressed in the english language
[09:48] <shadeslayer> Well .. you call it cheese
[09:48] <shadeslayer> except it tastes nothing like cheese
[09:48] <shadeslayer> we call it Paneer
[09:49] <smartboyhw> .....
[09:53] <smartboyhw> I think lordievader has to wait for a LONG time before he can get a good kde-workspace kf5-neon build:P
[10:06] <shadeslayer> yofel: how goes 4.11 for precise?
[10:06] <shadeslayer> the status page looks good
[10:06] <yofel> shadeslayer: good, except for the last 2
[10:06] <yofel> http://paste.kde.org/p5bb206ed/
[10:06] <yofel> not quite sure why I get that
[10:07] <yofel> (that was kget depends trying to force libglapi-mesa-lts-raring IIRC)
[10:07] <yofel> I'll spend some time on it later
[10:07] <soee> good morning
[10:07] <shadeslayer> something still depends on older mesa?
[10:07] <yofel> possibly, but the resolver output doesn't really say what :/
[10:08]  * shadeslayer needs to backport hplip for his home LTS install
[10:08] <shadeslayer> right
[10:09] <soee> Do we have RC2 for raring ?
[10:09] <shadeslayer> should be in beta ppa?
[10:09] <smartboyhw> soee, I think so, look at /topic
[10:09] <smartboyhw> It should be there:)
[10:09] <soee> ok let me check, thought i have beta enabled
[10:09] <yofel> hm, no
[10:09] <yofel> seems to be in staging
[10:09] <shadeslayer> o_o
[10:09] <yofel> oops
[10:10] <smartboyhw> o_o
[10:10] <shadeslayer> didn't I ask someone to move it before my ISP went bonkers?
[10:10] <smartboyhw> Who made that joke?
[10:10] <yofel> I think it was a misunderstanding
[10:10] <soee> yup beta enabled not updates though
[10:11] <yofel> someone copy it please, I'll generate l10n in the meanwhile
[10:13] <shadeslayer> yofel: running script
[10:19] <shadeslayer> yofel: copied all of staging into beta
[10:19] <shadeslayer> all raring packages I mean :)
[10:21] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, does it rebuild when copying?
[10:21] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: no
[10:21] <shadeslayer> binary only copy
[10:22] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, phew
[10:22] <shadeslayer> rebuilding would be silly
[10:22] <shadeslayer> oh and kppp seems to be missing
[10:25] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh!?
[10:25] <smartboyhw> Hmm, I don't have it here also
[10:28] <yofel> not in package list maybe?
[10:28] <yofel> it's not even in saucy
[10:29] <yofel> l10n uploading
[10:30] <yofel> hm, no, it is in the list
[10:30] <yofel> weird
[10:30]  * yofel wonders whether kubuntu-initial-upload failed
[10:31] <yofel> can someone update it? I'm gone for a bit
[10:31] <yofel> bbl
[10:31] <smartboyhw> I nominate shadeslayer ^
[10:33] <shadeslayer> kk
[10:34]  * shadeslayer is switching between Kubuntu Saucy, Kubuntu Precise and Windows XP too quickly
[10:34] <smartboyhw> lol
[10:39] <shadeslayer> kppp wasn't released in bzr
[10:40] <smartboyhw> Oh, so the script failed!
[10:41] <shadeslayer> ==== Skipping kppp, bzr branch has unexpected content, moving to manual/
[10:41] <shadeslayer> whaaa
[10:41] <smartboyhw> LOL LOL
[10:41] <smartboyhw> XD
[10:42]  * shadeslayer is sleepy
[10:43]  * smartboyhw kicks shadeslayer to wake him back up
[10:45] <shadeslayer> didn't help
[10:46] <smartboyhw> BTW apachelogger please resurrect kubotu
[10:46] <smartboyhw> It has disappeared.

[11:02] <smartboyhw> !??!?!?!?!?
[11:02] <smartboyhw> Somebody help:P
[11:15] <soee> ok can i run upgrade on Raring ?
[11:16] <smartboyhw> soee, probably, no -l10n and kppp available maybe
[11:17] <smartboyhw> Please contact shadeslayer for future details.
[11:17] <smartboyhw> :P
[11:17] <soee> :)
[11:18] <smartboyhw> Damn, it's further;P
[11:27] <BluesKaj> Howdy all
[11:31] <smartboyhw> NO.... Nobody wrote anything here (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/smartboyhw/KubuntuDeveloperApplication)... Sob....
[11:36] <shadeslayer> soee: please wait for 30 mins to iron out any publication issues
[11:37] <shadeslayer> then you can upgrade
[11:37] <shadeslayer> s/publication/publishing/
[11:37] <soee> shadeslayer, to late :)
[11:37] <shadeslayer> heh okay
[11:37] <yofel> smartboyhw: kdepim-runtime needs kolab backport probably
[11:38] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK
[11:38]  * shadeslayer can't have a look at kppp at the moment btw
[11:38] <yofel> smartboyhw: and I'll write something on that page when I know when the meeting is and I know I can't be there
[11:38] <smartboyhw> yofel, hmm?
[11:38] <smartboyhw> I thought it was write something before getting the meeting date set
[11:39] <yofel> well, currently you get +0.5 from me (I think you might need a bit more experience), so I'm reluctant to give a +1 by writing something on the page
[11:39] <yofel> so I would rather decide during the meeting
[11:40] <smartboyhw> OK
[11:41] <yofel> smartboyhw: are you already ubuntu-dev by something else or would that be your first developer membership?
[11:41] <smartboyhw> yofel, first
[11:41] <yofel> ok
[14:05] <smartboyhw> Hmm, somebody plz fix kdepim-runtime 4.10.97 quantal for me
[14:10] <yofel> did you backport kolab?
[14:10] <smartboyhw> yofel, I haven't, thank you for reminding, there's just a whole bunch of things to backport:(
[14:11] <smartboyhw> Hmm, I spotted a 1.0.1 release of kscreen...
[14:12] <smartboyhw> yofel, which kolab are you talking about?
[14:12] <yofel> libkolab and libkolabxml
[14:15] <smartboyhw> yofel, thank you. Backported
[14:17] <soee> upgrade to 4.10.97 on raring smooth :)
[14:18] <smartboyhw> afiestas, is kscreen and libkscreen 1.0.1 ready for packaging?
[14:18] <smartboyhw> soee, great:)
[14:20] <smartboyhw> Next time, I should have used urgency=medium for staging ppa uploads
[14:20] <smartboyhw> lol
[14:55] <smartboyhw> yofel, how to deal with kate? (I mean for pykde4)
[14:55] <smartboyhw> 4.10.97 quantal
[14:57] <manchicken> apachelogger: you there?
[15:07] <yofel> smartboyhw: is kde-runtime built? usually that's missing making pykde uninstallable
[15:07] <smartboyhw> yofel, kde-runtime? Checking
[15:07] <smartboyhw> Or you mean kdepim-runtime?
[15:08] <smartboyhw> kde-runtime is built
[15:08] <yofel> hm, retry
[15:08] <smartboyhw> Retried
[15:09] <manchicken> apachelogger is clearly slacking. He's probably sleeping or something :)
[15:09] <yofel> smartboyhw: oh, I misunderstood
[15:09] <yofel> you cannot backport pykde I think
[15:10] <smartboyhw> yofel, nah:P
[15:10] <smartboyhw> So?
[15:10] <yofel> delete it?
[15:10] <smartboyhw> yofel, oy?
[15:11] <yofel> quantal has too  old python3 for the current packaging, also you would need newer SIP, which means a rebuild of all SIP rdepends
[15:11] <yofel> have fun
[15:12] <yofel> (pykde is a bit of a packaging nightmare)
[15:14] <manchicken> I'm still not sure what the best way to get this to kill the packages is...
[15:14] <manchicken> I guess I could - after the install is finished - call the debugFinder to remove the sources.
[15:14] <manchicken> But we'd need to call an update to the cache again.
[15:15] <manchicken> I'll fix the crash first.
[15:18] <smartboyhw> yofel, I'm in the middle of it :)
[15:22] <yofel> s/:)/:(/    :P
[15:47] <smartboyhw> SOMEBODY GET KUBOTU BACK
[15:47] <yofel> what for?
[15:48] <yofel> you should rather say: someone wake harald up
[15:48] <yofel> too difficult
[15:49] <yofel> smartboyhw: if you need the newpackage plugin, that just runs 'newpackage' from kubuntu-dev-tools
[15:53] <smartboyhw> yofel, thanks
[15:53] <smartboyhw> The question: WAKE APACHELOGGER UP:P
[15:55] <manchicken> indeed.
[15:55] <manchicken> How do we function without him?
[15:59] <smartboyhw> yofel, how do I deal with missing-depends-line for a library?
[15:59] <smartboyhw> Ah, my fault, ignore ping
[16:03] <Quintasan> Hi
[16:12] <yofel> http://paste.kde.org/pc3ef2c23/ :(
[16:13] <smartboyhw> yofel, some good news from me at least: I think I mostly finished the package, and knocked it down to three lintian warnings (which really can't be dealt with)
[16:13] <yofel> when trying to build kget (apt-get -o debug::pkgproblemresolver=1 install kde-sc-dev-latest cmake debhelper pkg-kde-tools kdelibs5-dev libkonq5-dev libsqlite3-dev libqca2-dev kdepimlibs5-dev libktorrent-dev libmms-dev libboost1.48-dev kde-workspace-dev)

[20:38] <soee> hello
[20:39] <lordievader> Hey soee 
[20:52] <manchicken> apachelogger: I'm working on refactoring my changes to incorporate what you're describing, but I need to know how I can check the other bits. Smoke and such.
[20:55] <manchicken> Riddell: Dumb question - since you're sending emails I'm assuming you're online :) - if I update the apt cache following an install of the ddebs sources, I should also update the APT cache following a removal as well, right? We wouldn't want the ddebs sources cache to stick around once we've removed the sources?
[21:05] <ScottK> manchicken: You should.
[21:05] <manchicken> That's what I thought.
