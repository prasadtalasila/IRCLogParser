[12:09] <dnivra> Hello. I'm thinking of buying a GPU card and wanted to know which would be an idea choice to buy. I'm mostly going to use it for performing faster computations. I checked subpages in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards but most haven't been updated since 2011 so thought I'd check here. Also I've heard Linus Torvalds say that nVidia has been very tough to work with for the Linux devs.
[12:10] <dnivra> (i'm running Kubuntu 12.04.2 currently)
[12:21] <westmi> yeah, but nVisia has changed their tune since then
[12:21] <westmi> nvidia
[12:21] <westmi> they have released several new drivers since then
[12:22] <dnivra> Ah I see. That's good to know. Could you tell me how updated is the wiki link I'd posted earlier?
[12:22] <westmi> idk...
[12:23] <westmi> im going on personal experience here

[12:26] <dnivra> Ah okay. Thanks westmi!

[13:58] <alfonsojon> Hi, I'm having an issue with plasmoid's
[13:58] <alfonsojon> plasmoid's grip handle thing*
[13:59] <alfonsojon> Whenever using any type of desktop besides the default desktop, two handles appear on top of each other instead of just one handle. It's very annoying and it really bothers me for some reason

[13:59] <alfonsojon> The screenshot on top is the grouping desktop, while the desktop on bottom is the standard one.

[23:29] <graft_> hey guys, when i upgraded to 13.04 recently i started having some issues with video playback (e.g., i can't use xv or sdl output for mplayer, and if i enable desktop effects i have problems with streaking in my windows) - anyone know what gives or how to diagnose my issue?
