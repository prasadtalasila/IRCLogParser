[23:14] <jdoles> Why is boost packaged in the way that it is on LTS? libboost-locale1.48-dev has no associated debug package.
[23:15] <jdoles> libboost-dbg does exist, but it doesn't include locale...
[23:15] <jdoles> All in all, it seems like a total failure.
[23:21] <infinity> jdoles: http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/pool/universe/b/boost1.48/ might help.
[23:22] <infinity> jdoles: How or why the -dbg package is mangled or broken is another question, and I'm not sure, but the ddebs might be correct at least.
[23:24] <infinity> jdoles: Also, libboost-1.48-dbg might do better than libboost-dbg (which depends on 1.46)?
[23:26] <jdoles> infinity: what line do I need to have in sources.list in order for those to be visible in Synaptic?
[23:27] <jdoles> infinity: I already have a couple of them.
[23:27] <jdoles> infinity: e.g. deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com precise-updates main restricted universe multiverse
[23:28] <infinity> jdoles: That would do it, yes.  Though, as I pointed our, your problem could just be a version mismatch.  You said you were using libboost-locale1.48-dev but libboost-dbg.  1.48 versus 1.46
[23:29] <infinity> s/our/out/
[23:30] <jdoles> infinity: I don't care which version is used.
[23:30] <jdoles> infinity: all I am interested in is dbg packages for libboost-locale1.48-dev.
[23:31] <jdoles> infinity: and in such a way that they are visible in Synaptic.
[23:31] <infinity> ...
[23:31] <infinity> Which wouldn't be in libboost-dbg, because it's version 1.46.
[23:31] <jdoles> infinity: that's why I installed libboost-locale1.48-dev.
[23:31] <infinity> So you want libboost1.48-dbg
[23:31] <jdoles> infinity: and then found out there was no dbg package...
[23:31] <jdoles> infinity: and then asked here.
[23:32] <jdoles> infinity: I thought that part was clear.
[23:34] <infinity> jdoles: It was clear, yes.  And then I went version hunting after I gave the ddeb advice and realised that "libboost-dbg" depends on version 1.46, and libboost-locale1.48-dev is (obviously) 1.48
[23:34] <infinity> jdoles: So, again, try installing libboost1.48-dbg
[23:47] <jdoles> infinity: thanks
