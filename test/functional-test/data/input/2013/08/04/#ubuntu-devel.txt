[13:31] <phillw>  Hi good people, is apt-get easy link for such areas as https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats going to be made working again, or do we need to remove it from the wiki pages and use the terminal command only?
[19:44] <xnox> GridCube: see #ubuntu-mir, but note that most people are away during weekend.
[19:45] <xnox> jdoles: just precise-updates is not enough, you should have precise, precise-security as well.
[19:51] <GridCube> xnox, :) thanks, i found it yesterday and got the answer i needed, there is no support for multiple monitors so far
[19:51] <xnox> GridCube: there are bugs open and it's work in progress. I am waiting for it as well.
[20:21] <jdoles> xnox: I have those too.
[20:26]  * xnox is confused about zsh FTBFS
[20:29] <jdoles> xnox: do you know where a fastcgi application started by Apache2 has its current working directory?
[20:30] <xnox> jdoles: hm.... not really, no. Why are you asking me? =) i'm not really fastcgi nor apache2 expert.
[20:30] <jdoles>  I think I will just have to redesign the application then, if nobody can tell me this.
[20:31] <xnox> jdoles: what application?!
[20:38] <cjwatson> jdoles: Arrange for it to hang around for long enough that you can inspect the running process, and then look at /proc/PROCESS-ID/cwd
[20:38] <cjwatson> Or indeed just have it print out /proc/$$/cwd or the equivalent in whatever language is involved
[20:39] <cjwatson> print out> I mean print the target of that symlink
[20:39] <jdoles> xnox: it's a question which is not dependent on the application.
[20:40] <jdoles> cjwatson: thank you.
[20:40] <jdoles> cjwatson: pwdx should be implemented with that.
[20:41] <jdoles> cjwatson: because your solution works in an environment where pwdx doesn't.
[20:41] <cjwatson> pwdx *is* implemented with that
[20:41] <cjwatson> (I just checked)
[20:42] <jdoles> cjwatson: that's odd.
[20:43] <cjwatson> There's no other way to get the working directory of another process, as far as I know
[20:43] <jdoles> cjwatson: pwdx: invalid process id: 12341
[20:43] <cjwatson> Then that process doesn't exist, so you're calling it wrong ...
[20:43] <jdoles> cjwatson: no, because file /proc/12341/cwd does work.
[20:44] <cjwatson> Dunno.  strace it to find out
[20:44]  * cjwatson has to go attend to baby
[20:45] <jdoles> cjwatson: it's not locale independent.
[20:46] <jdoles> cjwatson: I don't think the locale should matter this much at least, and as such it's a bug.

[23:03] <cjwatson> jdoles: Where's the locale-dependency?  (That said I can't say I even knew about pwdx before you mentioned it; seems like a niche tool)
[23:18] <lifeless> cjwatson: remember me mentioning a failed GPT grub environment? I held of filing until I upgraded to R, in case it was fixed. It wasn't.... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1208268
[23:18] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1208268 in grub2 (Ubuntu) "grub not recognising my GPT+mdadm+lvm layout" [Undecided,New]
[23:18] <lifeless> cjwatson: if you could let me know what info you need to reproduce, I'll add it in asap
