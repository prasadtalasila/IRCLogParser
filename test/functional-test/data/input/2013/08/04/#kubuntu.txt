[00:15] <ruedii> Hello, I'm having trouble getting my EFI bootloader to install right.
[00:15] <ruedii> My two guesses are that one of the updates are screwing it up, or I need to reboot after creating the EFI partition before I can use it.
[00:15] <ruedii> Which do you think might be the case?
[00:19] <ruedii> Can someone help me figure out why the grub-efi bootloader is failing to install properly on my system?
[00:29] <ruedii> OK, I changed two things.  I didn't preinstall updates with my install, and I changed my efi partition from 512MB (which may be too big for my BIOS) down to 199MB.
[00:29] <seba__> ciao hello
[00:29] <ruedii> Does anyone know if either of those things would have caused the EFI-Grub install to fail?
[00:30] <seba__> my grub too fail in black screen
[00:30] <seba__> ah install
[00:30] <ruedii> Also, EFI.
[00:32] <seba__> check in bios if  your installation dvd/usb start from uefi
[00:33] <seba__> ruedii "secure boot" option (in BIOS) is disabled?
[00:33] <ruedii> seba__ I believe so
[00:34] <ruedii> However, if I recall grub-efi now works with secure boot.   I haven't installed any other OS on here with secure boot, so it shouldn't be an issue.
[00:34] <ruedii> Also, it would give a very specific error if it was secure boot.  It's just giving a very generic one.
[00:34] <ruedii> I'm getting: Executing 'grub-install dummy' failed.
[00:36] <seba__> u have to disable secure boot
[00:36] <seba__> i remember the same error but not remeber how i made
[00:36] <ruedii> I think it is disabled, but I will double check.
[00:37] <ruedii> Windows has never been installed on this computer, so it shouldn't be an issue, though.
[00:41] <seba__> Someone can learn me how to manually config grub? if i press enter while Kubuntu GNU/Linux is selected system freeze, if i try using superGrubDisk2 to start from an existing grub in (hd0,gpt2) my kubuntu start normally
[00:43] <seba__> p.s. cannot use auto-repair (es. rescatux) because the disk is crypted and live cd don't recognize the system, but only the loop distro (itself)
[00:46] <seba__> PLS someone can HELP
[00:49] <seba__> anyone know ho to set grub
[01:53] <valorie> !grub | seba__

[02:08] <seba__> thank you ubotto and valorie now i see what appen
[02:11] <valorie> oh cool
[02:36] <Ruedii> OK, I rebooted to check if my BIOS had SecureBoot enabled, and it turns out it doesn't even support secureboot.  The EFI loader on my Kubuntu Thumb Drive confirms this.  (If I recall secureboot requires an external security module on my motherboard, which you couldn't pay me to install. :D)
[02:38] <Ruedii> Do I set the "Boot Partition" the EFI partition, the EFI Drive, or the root/boot partition?
[03:16] <em-web> If I have some downloaded movies is it possible to somehow burn them to a DVD such that I could view them on a television with a DVD player?
[03:17] <Ruedii> em-web, that's not exactly legal if they are copyrighted.   You can search for the web on how to do that, though.
[03:35] <emm> Hi
[03:35] <emm> sorry i disconnected
[03:35] <emm> Not sure if anyone saw my question
[03:36] <emm> How could I convert a video in mkv into a format which I could burn on to a DVD and watch on my television with a DVD player?
[03:44] <seba__> emm see http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/mkv-to-avi-conversion-855764/
[03:45] <seba__> nono this is newer http://linuxg.net/how-to-convert-an-mkv-file-to-mp4-by-terminal/
[03:48] <valorie> !efi
[03:48] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[03:48] <valorie> huh
[03:49] <emm> was that to me?
[03:56] <valorie> emm, no for Rueddi, but s/he parted
[04:10] <emm> valorie: oh okay : )

[04:28] <seba__> ok i started boot rescue and saved file, now downloading chakra and byebye kubuntu
[04:30] <seba__> goodbye all
[05:12] <ruedii> OK, I've given up on doing an EFI install.   I'm seing if I can coax the x86-64 version to install in MBR on my system.   Anyone know how to force the AMD64 version of Kubuntu to force MBR installation?
[05:39] <valorie> ruedii: do you mean a /boot partition?
[05:45] <ruedii> valorie, no I mean use the MBR instead of trying to use EFI.
[05:48] <valorie> did you read this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[05:48] <valorie> I posted it for you, but you had left

[06:56] <kaffeebohne> Hi. I just wanted to install calibre, but I get a "502 internal error - server connection terminated". "apt-get update" works fine though.

[08:14] <zizoo> Is there a way to keep an Android phone in sync with KDE PIM stuff on the fly? Say Google Calendar sync?
=== Bigcheese_ is now known as Bigcheese
[08:24] <palasso> zizoo: yes you can use Google Calendar and sync your KOrganizer with it
[08:27] <palasso> You can also use other cloud services with KOrganizer (and use android apps that use those services). Finally you can use a .ics file stored on some folder that gets synced to your phone and opened up by an android app that opens .ics calendar files
[08:28] <zizoo> Ah ok thanks. KOrganizer, duh. Google immediately gives back much clearer information searching for that. Following a guide and will get back.
[08:28] <zizoo> Oh, or if that doesn't work I might try something with Tasker, .ics files, and Dropbox.
[08:29] <palasso> zizoo: using KOrganizer with a Google Calendar is easy. Just add a new calendar on KOrganizer, from the types select Google Calendar, add your google info and you're ready
[08:30] <palasso> A combination with an .ics file stored on dropbox (or whatever else mechanism you have to sync to the phone) and open it with KOrganizer on the desktop and an android app on the phone works as well
[08:33] <palasso> Or other cloud services like Kolab etc.
[08:33] <palasso> DAV, Open X-change
[08:35] <zizoo> Yeah, last time I tried to do this it wasn't this easy at all. But I guess it's been a couple years. Thanks!
[08:38] <zizoo> Does anything in the KDE PIM interfaces let me access these cool Nepomuk ontologies I've been reading about? I saw something on a site for Mandriva Linux, but it was 3 years old and I couldn't find the plasmoid widget anywhere....
[08:39] <zizoo> It was a task management system that used TMO modeling. I know I won't be able to use that data from the phone even if I get it to sync, but I really wanted to try it.
[08:43] <zizoo> Ah, and TMO is the Task Model Ontology, as found here: http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/

[09:18] <juancarlospaco> zizoo: its pretty easy from python, I created a plugin for an IDE I help to develop, you can git it from https://github.com/juancarlospaco/semantic
[09:18] <juancarlospaco> just 1 3-liner method
[09:49] <zizoo> Oh cool, thanks juancarlospaco. I've never used Ninja IDE, but now I'll be looking into it.
[09:56] <juancarlospaco> zizoo:  ok, the point its the nepomuk method that this particular plugin has :)
[09:56] <juancarlospaco> but the IDE is awesome too  :D
