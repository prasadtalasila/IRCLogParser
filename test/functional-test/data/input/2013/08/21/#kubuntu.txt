[02:45] <Guest61394> Hello. I'm trying to install Kubuntu in a machine with UEFI boot, but the installer is unable to install grub into the UEFI partition. What should I do?

[03:48] <cantinstallgrub> Hello. My Kubuntu installation fails in the end because it cannot install the grub-efi package successfully. I'm trying to recover it manually, following this page: http://superuser.com/questions/376470/how-to-reinstall-grub2-efi, but it doesn't work either, I get errors when trying to reinstall it. What should I do?

[05:49] <skreech_> !EFI
[05:49] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI

[06:00] <skreech_> No that was for me
[06:00] <skreech_>  I forget the stance of UEFI. I'm still really wary of buying a new computer because of it
[06:01] <valorie> ah, ok
[06:01] <valorie> hiya skreech_
[06:01] <skreech_> hi valorie!!!

[06:01] <valorie> seems to be a bit of a hurdle, but people overcome it
[06:17] <skreech_> valorie: is it still fragmented by Distro?
[06:18] <valorie> uefi? I don't know
[06:18] <valorie> I guess ask the arch, fedora and opensuse people about that

[08:11] <ubottu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit

[12:23] <viteac> HI
[12:24]  * viteac is wondering why there's no buttons LEAVE, RESTART in KUBUNTU 13.04
[12:25] <naughx> there is :o
[12:25] <smartboyhw> viteac, there certainly is
[12:25] <naughx> Open the KDE menu
[12:26] <viteac> then something wrong went after restarting, I do not have them
[12:26] <smartboyhw> :O
[12:26] <viteac> naughx: when I open Kmenu, I go to Leave/ there is only Logout and Lock
[12:27] <viteac> I regret now moving from 8 something ;/
[12:27] <BluesKaj> ight click on the desktop , choose leave
[12:27] <viteac> its same man
[12:28] <BluesKaj> then choose logout , once on the logout page choose the red leave button down in the right hand corner
[12:29] <naughx> It's in french, but I've it. http://imgur.com/1xJwNba
[12:29] <BluesKaj> you obviously logged in and out previously
[12:29] <BluesKaj> viteac,^
[12:29] <viteac> there is no other option, even in login out menu where is counting to... , or even same when I want to log in just lock and logout
[12:30] <viteac> certaintly when want to reboot or shut the comp I need go to console ;/
[12:30] <BluesKaj> topen a terminal , sudo halt 
[12:31] <viteac> I know how to do it BluesKaj 
[12:31] <BluesKaj> or reboot
[12:31] <BluesKaj> have you updated/upgraded lately , viteac?
[12:32] <viteac> It doesnt bother me, I'm using nix since 1th versions ;-), but I'm not only one using PC at home
[12:32] <viteac> my wife use it, and 2kids :-)
[12:32] <viteac> I dont want them scary them with black screens ;-)
[12:32] <BluesKaj> then put windows on the pc for them 
[12:33] <viteac> No windows in mine home
[12:33] <BluesKaj> then teach your family that black scrns aren't scary 
[12:34] <naughx> @BluesKaj, BSOD are more. >.>
[12:34] <viteac> BluesKaj: egh BluesKaj not so easy always, but this silly chat doesnt solve mine problem actually.
[12:35] <viteac> not everybody likes this wau communicating with computer.
[12:35] <BluesKaj> I asked you before if you updated and upgraded lately , viteac
[12:37] <viteac> BluesKaj: to be honest is crashing while updating, first wanted to do installation of Mozilla and adds ons for mozi, und I was curious with Mozilla firefox Installer from Kmenu, and that things stopped while: WAITING  with installation.
[12:38] <naughx> It's should've worked...
[12:38] <naughx> it*
[12:38] <viteac> killed it, and wanted check UPDATES, for sake there were some (althought I checked updates while installing the system).
[12:38] <BluesKaj> just run an update then , and try the FF installer again
[12:38] <ikonia> why not just use firefox.....from the ubuntu repos
[12:39] <naughx> sudo apt-get install firefox
[12:39] <viteac> if there is no solution for this yeah I'm going to do it.
[12:39] <ikonia> viteac: why not just do it as it's supported software
[12:39] <viteac> ikonia: I was just curious with this new wizard. 
[12:39] <naughx> Muon package manager?
[12:39] <ikonia> sorry, that seems crazy
[12:39] <viteac> and unluckyli it was not working.
[12:40] <ikonia> you just said other people use the PC - yet your messing around unkwno software
[12:40] <viteac> ikonia: it's just a PC :/
[12:41] <viteac> that's my job anyway
[12:41] <BluesKaj> the FF installer used to be default , dunno if it still is , haven't done a clean install since 12.04 
[12:41] <viteac> If you have backup, many disc you can mess with you PC it doesn't bite you.
[12:41] <ikonia> viteac: yes, but your argument was that other people use the PC 
[12:42] <BluesKaj> due to the ubiquity HW recognition problem that the devs can't seem to solve
[12:42] <viteac> yeah, and I want to have friendly PC at home, so I don't want to teach a wife line commands if she doesn't want.
[12:42] <ikonia> so don't put unknown software on it
[12:43] <ikonia> keep it stable and use trusted software
[12:43] <viteac> why?
[12:43] <viteac> that's is not problem.
[12:43] <ikonia> because it breaks like this and then isn't a friendly computer 
[12:43] <ikonia> oh, you seem to be asking how to fix a problem, suggesting it's a problem you can't fix
[12:43] <ikonia> that struck me as a problem 
[12:43] <viteac> no you're wrong.
[12:44] <viteac> Just came to ask if you meet the problem.
[12:44] <ikonia> carry on then, it's clear you don't need help
[12:44] <BluesKaj> there's no leave option in the shutdown dialog , ikonia
[12:44] <viteac> Just wanted solve it without rebooting the window manager.
[12:45] <ikonia> BluesKaj: yes, but he doesn't need help, 
[12:45] <ikonia> BluesKaj: he's just said. 
[12:45] <ikonia> BluesKaj: to me that seems like a pretty big problem for other users if there are no buttons
[12:45] <ikonia> but I'm wrong
[12:46] <viteac> oh ikonia go take some air because your'e brain is crashing.
[12:46] <ikonia> I assure you it's not
[12:46] <BluesKaj> viteac, reboot your pc , see if the shutdown button is back 
[12:47] <viteac> BluesKaj: funny because done it already and there're not.
[12:47] <viteac> Ok, I go away, having fun what went wrong ;-)
[12:48] <BluesKaj> the shut it off completely and boot up again :)
[12:48] <BluesKaj> then
[12:49] <BluesKaj> ahh ppl with attitude become trolls so quickly :)
[12:50] <viteac> yeah, I check logs yet and try another account however I were not doing anything with Icons, or rights. The first thing I were doing was updates and installing mozilla when had have reset PC after installing os.
[12:50] <naughx> Back:)
[12:55] <BluesKaj> interesting that some users think of the command line as unfriendly 
[12:57] <BluesKaj> it's the opposite in fact ...fewer processes required to achieve an action
[12:57] <Tm_T> BluesKaj: if there's gui method to do things and the user is more familiar with the gui, I'd recommend instructing them with the gui tools
[13:00] <BluesKaj> yes at first the gui is the method to use , but after one becomes familiar with the OS, it's time for a new phase and IMO learning some terminal commands is the next step

I'm trying to recover it manually, following this page: http://superuser.com/questions/376470/how-to-reinstall-grub2-efi, but it doesn't work either, I get errors when trying to reinstall it. I'm trying to install it in the Asus UX31A (Zenbook Prime). Is this a known problem? What should I do?

[15:38] <IdleOne> on 13.04 I have had kscreen being held back for over a month. Could someone tell me why this package is being held back?
[15:45] <BluesKaj> IdleOne, have you updated your kde version ?
[15:46] <IdleOne> BluesKaj: I run the updates regularly, but I haven't gone outside the regular repos.
[15:46] <IdleOne> so no PPA's
[15:47] <BluesKaj> IdleOne, got the backports enabled ?
[15:52] <IdleOne> sorry, had to step away a moment. let me check the backports
[15:53] <IdleOne> BluesKaj: nope, backports are not enabled
[15:55] <NalakaHewa_> Hi, does kubuntu have mysql server by default or do I have to install it?
[15:58] <BluesKaj> IdleOne, well , if your interested in the latest KDE version run a dist-upgrade 
[15:59] <IdleOne> BluesKaj: I have, but kscreen is still held back
[15:59] <BluesKaj> IdleOne, odd , I haven't noticed that on 13.04 , I'll have to check . I'm on 13.10 atm 
[16:00] <BluesKaj> BBL 
[16:00] <IdleOne> it doesn't seem to be affecting my install it just a little annoying to me to see that 1 package not updating :)
