[00:07] <littlegirl> Hey there, I'm using Kubuntu 12.04. My Window Decorations are Plastik. My Desktop Theme is Air for Netbooks. I can't for the life of me figure out how to change the color of my entire panel all the way across. Any ideas?
[00:07] <littlegirl> I've got all the rest of the colors the way I like them, but my panel is still the default grey (which does not go with the hot pink rest of it all). (:
[00:10] <alfonsojon> Hi.
[00:10] <alfonsojon> I'm using Kubuntu on the ARM Chromebook
[00:11] <alfonsojon> Ironically, it's the smoothest Linux distro on this specific Chromebook. However, I was wondering, are there any proprietary drivers for the Mali T604 I can install to improve the experience?
[00:11] <alfonsojon> Right now, 2D acceleration is pretty "meh". It works but it's very laggy and just undesirable.
[00:34] <littlegirl> Hey there, does anybody know how to change the background color of the panel in Kubuntu 12.04?
[00:34] <Pibble> Which panel?
[00:34] <littlegirl> The default panel at the bottom. The one with the main Kubuntu menu, the tasks, and the kickoff.
[00:34] <Pibble> Find a different theme
[00:35] <Pibble> there are a ton of them out there
[00:35] <Pibble> I think 12.04 has oxygen and air by default
[00:35] <littlegirl> I've figured out how to theme it sort of, which just changes it from light grey to dark grey to black, and that's the end of my selections. I'd just like to change its color to pink. (:
[00:35] <Pibble> but there are thousands of them
[00:35] <littlegirl> Thanks. I'll see if I can figure it out. I'
[00:35] <Pibble> :3
[00:35] <littlegirl> I've got all my other colors just the way I want them, but this panel is being difficult. (:
[00:36] <Pibble> Yeah, themes will do what you want
[00:36] <Pibble> :3
[00:36] <littlegirl> Cool, thanks. I'll see if I can do it without messing up everything else. (: (: (:
=== FlyingFoXy is now known as FlyingFoX
[00:44] <alfonsojon> Can anyone help me out with my laptop?
[00:45] <alfonsojon> KDE runs buttery-smooth minus 2D and 3D acceleration, and I'm stuck on Xrender.
[00:45] <alfonsojon> This is on the Mali T604, and I can't find any drivers for it.
[01:02] <littlegirl> alfonsojon: If you're still here, there's this page, but I have no idea whether it's legitimate or would be useful: https://github.com/hrw/chromebook-mali-driver
[01:02] <littlegirl> alfonsojon: He seems to have some more information here: http://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2013/04/15/hardware-acceleration-on-chromebook/
[01:05] <alfonsojon> Thanks
[01:05] <littlegirl> alfonsojon: Any time. If neither of those help, you might want to do your searches with Ubuntu rather than Kubuntu since that's the more popular release, and anything that works for Ubuntu *should* work for Kubuntu. (:
[01:05] <alfonsojon> littlegirl: Thanks
[01:05] <alfonsojon> Alright :D
[01:06] <alfonsojon> In fact, it should work better with Kubuntu if I'm not mistaken
[01:06] <alfonsojon> KWin supports OpenGL ES a lot better AFAIK
[01:06] <littlegirl> Yeah. I'm just thinking that when I do searches for Kubuntu stuff, a lot of the time I get Ubuntu results, so I tend to do Ubuntu searches if I can't find whatever I'm looking for with a Kubuntu search. (:
[01:07] <littlegirl> If you're having slow performance, did you turn off Desktop effects? That can make a nice difference. (:
[01:07]  * littlegirl uses older hardware, so she turns those off.
[01:07] <alfonsojon> It's not slow performance
[01:07] <alfonsojon> Like I said before, it's just "meh"
[01:07] <littlegirl> LOL
[01:08] <alfonsojon> whoops, CTRL+Q not for the win
[01:08] <alfonsojon> But anyways, it's not slow, it's just "meh"
[01:08] <littlegirl> Well, I'm happy, because I managed to find a theme that lets me turn my panel a different color, so my Kubuntu is now hot pink *everywhere*. (:
[01:08] <alfonsojon> Vsync doesn't work, OpenGL mode works somewhat (I think?)
[01:08] <alfonsojon> Even without compisition
[01:08] <alfonsojon> Moving windows looks like they're chunking apart
[01:08] <littlegirl> Ouch!
[01:09] <alfonsojon> At least Kickoff opens smoothly
[01:09] <alfonsojon> Plasma works fine
[01:09] <alfonsojon> KWin? Eh.
[01:09] <littlegirl> That's good. Now to just figure out the parts that don't. (:
[01:10] <alfonsojon> I'm thinking about investing in a 16 GB SD-XC card
[01:10] <alfonsojon> But one that's small and can hide under the plastic
[01:10] <alfonsojon> That way, I can get near-USB 3.0 speeds and essentially a second internal SSD
[01:10] <littlegirl> Nice!
[01:11] <alfonsojon> But honestly
[01:11] <alfonsojon> For $249, this laptop is a jouy
[01:11] <alfonsojon> joy*
[01:12] <littlegirl> That sounds like a great price! Did it come with Linux on it?
[01:12] <alfonsojon> It's the ARM Chromebook :D
[01:12] <alfonsojon> Technically, yes.
[01:12] <littlegirl> That's Greek to me. (:
[01:12] <alfonsojon> It's a google laptop
[01:12] <alfonsojon> It runs Google Chrome OS
[01:12] <Pibble> The chromebooks have google os
[01:12] <Pibble> which IS linux
[01:12] <alfonsojon> It's linux but locked down
[01:12] <Pibble> but youre locked out of anything lowlevel on them
[01:12] <littlegirl> Ah, like my Google tablet that wants to get Kubuntu Active on it when they have it figured out. (:
[01:12] <alfonsojon> Not full GNU
[01:13] <Pibble> Im on a chomebook c7
[01:13] <Pibble> right now
[01:13] <Pibble> running kubuntu
[01:13] <alfonsojon> Pibble: I'm debating removing the BIOS read-only screw and flashing a custom BIOS
[01:13] <littlegirl> Pibble, thanks for the help! I'm all hot pink in my panel now. (:
[01:13] <Pibble> alfonsojon: do a whole lot of research on it.
[01:13] <alfonsojon> I have
[01:13] <Pibble> littlegirl: welcome, glad I could help
[01:14] <alfonsojon> I'm not doing it =yet= because it seems scary and I haven't even opened this laptop up yet
[01:14] <alfonsojon> Scary being i don't want to kill it.
[01:14] <Pibble> Dont do it until the machines are better understood too
[01:18] <alfonsojon> Pibble
[01:18] <alfonsojon> What's your opinion on the C7?
[01:19] <alfonsojon> Is it worth the price or is the ARM one worth the $50?
[01:19] <Pibble> C7 is a solid computer with a full OS
[01:19] <Pibble> it is NOT a netbook
[01:19] <alfonsojon> My main question is really battery life
[01:20] <alfonsojon> Considering with mine, I get beyond what the paper says (7 hours, 6.5 hours advertised)
[01:20] <alfonsojon> What do you get?
[01:20] <Pibble> Full charge, with modest browsing and application... 2.5 hours
[01:20] <alfonsojon> That's not that bad for the price
[01:20] <Pibble> I could prolly bump that to 3ish if I tried
[01:20] <Pibble> but that would limit the application of the entire computer
[01:20] <alfonsojon> can't you swap out the HDD for an SSD and upgrade the battery?
[01:20] <Pibble> In time, im sure
[01:21] <Pibble> But it has more robust hardware
[01:21] <alfonsojon> If it had an SSD, I'm sure the battery life would be better
[01:21] <augie> whats a decent netbook to get if I just want to run Kubuntu on it?
[01:21] <Pibble> Like I said, its a good laptop, but not a netbook
[01:21] <alfonsojon> augie: Depends on what you need it for :)
[01:22] <augie> im using an Acer F-020 right now running Kubuntu as a virtual machine
[01:22] <alfonsojon> augie, what do you need to do with this laptop?
[01:22] <augie> I'm a network security student and studying linux networking and security as a course. I don't want to run it as a virtual machine for long because I want to use it as a stand alone system
[01:23] <alfonsojon> Is $995 too expensive for you?
[01:23] <augie> for sure. I'm in Australia. everything is insanely expensive here
[01:23] <alfonsojon> Because I really like the Galago UltraPro by System76
[01:23] <alfonsojon> Ah.
[01:24] <augie> I'm not sure so this might be a stuopid question but will I be able to install it on a chromebook? :P
[01:24] <augie> I can get one for AUD$300
[01:24] <alfonsojon> Which Chromebook?
[01:27] <augie> http://www.harveynorman.com.au/acer-chromebook.html
[01:28] <Pibble> http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B009VHRMOU
[01:28] <Pibble> I have that one
[01:29] <augie> how does it work for you?
[01:29] <Pibble> Fine, for me
[01:29] <augie> is there ANY way to install Kubuntu on top of ubuntu ? :S
[01:30] <Pibble> You can install ubuntu then KDE
[01:30] <augie> I want to install Kubuntu on my other machine which currently has ubuntu 13.04 and I HATE the unity desktop
[01:30] <Pibble> Just run KDE instead of unity
[01:31] <augie> I'll have to install it on top and the desktop will change to KDE right?
[01:32] <alfonsojon> augie: My laptop just committed suicide
[01:32] <alfonsojon> Which brings me to my main point
[01:32] <augie> lol
[01:32] <alfonsojon> If this is the Samsung ARM Chromebook, the support isn't the greatest.
[01:32] <alfonsojon> I'm running Kubuntu 13.10 on my ARM Chromebook and it has its "quirks"
[01:33] <alfonsojon> First of all, there is no video acceleration. Expect lag.
[01:33] <augie> Samsung would be way to expensive here
[01:33] <alfonsojon> It's the $249 USD one
[01:33] <alfonsojon> Are you talking about the Acer one?
[01:33] <augie> I was going for the Acer Chromebook
[01:33] <augie> http://www.harveynorman.com.au/acer-chromebook.html
[01:33] <alfonsojon> ah.
[01:33] <alfonsojon> ........
[01:33] <alfonsojon> Why is everything over in Australia so expensive!?
[01:34] <alfonsojon> That laptop costs $199 here.
[01:34] <alfonsojon> $1 USD = $1.09 AUD
[01:35] <alfonsojon> Meaning if my laptop costs $249, it costs $272 AUD
[01:35] <augie> because we're in the extreme end of the freakin world
[01:35] <alfonsojon> And the $199 Acer one you're thinking about costs $217 AUD. Yet they're selling it for $300 AUD????
[01:35] <alfonsojon> Well, that's besides the point
[01:35] <augie> and by the time stuff gets here the transport cost is so huge that everything doubles in price sometimes
[01:35] <alfonsojon> Pibble: How does Kubuntu run on your Acer chromebook?
[01:37] <augie> I have ubuntu installed on my Acer F020 netbook but I want one to install and purely run Kubuntu on it or even BackTrack for my seucrity course
[01:38] <alfonsojon> augie: It should work fine
[01:38] <alfonsojon> You'll need to enable developer mode and use Chrubuntu though
[01:39] <augie> Chrubuntu? what's that?
[01:41] <augie> I won't be able to run the stock Kubuntu installation that I have on the Chromebook?
[01:42] <alfonsojon> No.
[01:42] <alfonsojon> It works the same but the installation process differs extremely
[01:42] <alfonsojon> You can't just make a live USB and boot it that way
[01:42] <augie> oh ok
[01:42] <alfonsojon> unfortunately
[01:43] <augie> haha why would it be simple :P
[01:43] <augie> nothing worth doing ever is
[01:43] <alfonsojon> It's actually not hard

[13:07] <alvin> Well, I've never needed it, but I've found this. Worth a try. http://askubuntu.com/questions/73804/wrong-login-screen-resolution Maybe changing the lightdm resolution helps. Otherwise it's the KDE resolution and you can just do that in settings.
[13:09] <ignerious> alvin: sorry to say this is not at all
[13:11] <alvin> That's remarkable. So, there is the resolution for GRUB and text mode. Afterwards, there's X, and X is split in lightdm, ksplash and KDE? Those are a lot of places to set a resolution for. I used to fix stuff like that in KDM's xrandr configuration, but that was when KDM was still used.

[17:06] <Anne-senpai> Hi.  Question on a wifi issue (Intel Wireless-N BGN using iwlwifi driver): I've noticed that my speed starts out decent enough, but drops to zero almost immediately.  I've searched through forums and blogs, and even tried using a Bash script to "force" it into 54 Mpbs, but even that doesn't work.  Any help on this?
[17:08] <Anne-senpai> I'd had the same problem in 12.04 and 12.10, and am running 13.04 now.
[17:10] <genii> Anne-senpai: This is the first I've ever heard of such an issue. It's very weird.
[17:10] <Anne-senpai> It seems that all the Bash script really does is lie to NetworkManager, since it is listing the speed at 54Mbps, when any form of dowloading (including BitTorrent and just through a browser) seems to be at a maximum of 400Kbps down.
[17:11] <Anne-senpai> It seems that all the Bash script really does is lie to NetworkManager, since it is listing the speed at 54Mbps...etc
[17:12] <Anne-senpai> A simple page load for Google just took about 45 seconds, and a basic search (terms: "ubuntu speed drops") took about 30 seconds or more
[17:13] <Anne-senpai> I have also tried this with the machine (single user, laptop) throughout the house, on several days of different weather, and line of sight and barrometric pressure doesn't change a thing
[17:14] <Avihay> have you tried with a hard line?
[17:14] <Anne-senpai> Yes.  Proper speed.  It is only when I am using wifi.
[17:15] <Anne-senpai> Problem is that there is only one place in the house where the laptop and I can get along comfortably, and it can't be using a hard line there (too easy to trip everyone)
[17:15] <Avihay> and does this happen only with your home wifi?
[17:15] <Anne-senpai> No, sadly
[17:15] <Avihay> I guess I'd go looking for a different/better driver
[17:17] <Avihay> well, I've heard something bout disabling the N version of wifi protocol on some problematic boards improves performance (if I understand it correctly)
[17:19] <Anne-senpai> Not entirely sure if I tried it, and not entirely sure what to do after running the one-liner to disable N
[17:19] <Avihay> me neither :-<
[17:21] <Anne-senpai> No, what I mean by that is, after I've run it (it being echo options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1 | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/51-disable-6235-11n.conf ), do I then reboot, disconnect then reconnect to the network, logout and back, etc

[19:09] <streulma> hello, I don't know how to change the screen resolution on Kubuntu
[19:12] <DarthFrog> streulma:  SystemSettings/Hardware/Display and Monitor/Display Configuration.
[19:13] <DarthFrog> Or you could try krandr.
[19:13] <streulma> is Kubuntu better to run in Macbook Pro Retina then Gnome ?
[19:14] <DarthFrog> streulma:  I think you might be able to predict the answer if you come on to the #Kubuntu channel and ask if Kubuntu is better than GNOME. :-)
[19:18] <[RoeyInABox]> hi
[19:19] <[RoeyInABox]> ever since I upgraded to Ringtail, I've noticed that after a few hours, my graphics starts to really lag and chop up
[19:19] <[RoeyInABox]> what's with this?  Is this a memory leak?
[23:25] <chachan> guys, I'm having continuous disconnection on WiFi. Some details: http://paste.kde.org/pc5bdbfed/
[23:25] <chachan> I don't see anything on dmesg, and syslog has a lot of reconnection things...
[23:27] <chachan> I have more devices connected to this router without having disconnection. Also I tried connecting to my android using hotspot and I still get disconnected
[23:28] <chachan> the weird thing is that network manager doesn't change its status, it thinks is still connected. Another thing is that I can't even ping the router API
[23:28] <chachan> when I disconnect and connect through network manager, it restores the connection without any problem
