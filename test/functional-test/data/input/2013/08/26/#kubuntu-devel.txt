[02:48] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1196344 in kde-workspace (Ubuntu) "ksplashqml crashed with SIGSEGV in QObject::setProperty()" [Medium,Confirmed]
[03:07] <smartboyhw> kubotu: newpackage libqinfinity 0.5.0
[03:07] <kubotu> Package libqinfinity already exists!
[03:07] <smartboyhw> Oh, new version?
[03:08] <smartboyhw> OY, Debian crapped it up
[03:08] <smartboyhw> The released version is 0.5.0 and Debian used 1.0:O
[03:09] <smartboyhw> kubotu: newpackage kte-collaborative 0.0.95

[03:09] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1216743 in Ubuntu "[needs-packaging] kte-collaborative" [Undecided,New]
[03:21] <smartboyhw> Hmm, more weird, libqinfinity existed in Lucid only...
[03:21] <smartboyhw> ScottK, any method to delete the package?
[03:21] <smartboyhw> I mean, libqinifity
[03:21] <smartboyhw> (In Lucid I say)
[03:22] <ScottK> Not in Lucid, no.
[03:22] <smartboyhw> ScottK, but now the version number in Lucid is greater than the current version number:O
[03:22] <smartboyhw> In Lucid it's 1.0~beta5-1
[03:23] <smartboyhw> But the new release is 0.5.0
[03:24] <smartboyhw> ScottK, any ideas?
[03:31] <smartboyhw> kubotu: newversion libqinfinity 0.5.0
[03:31] <kubotu> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1216746
[04:17] <ScottK> Even if you removed it, it wouldn't help.  The higher version has been used.
[04:19] <ScottK> Ask Debian to use an epoch.  In the mean time, upload it as 1.0~really0.5
[04:20] <smartboyhw> ScottK, got it
[06:15] <smartboyhw> Hmm, still can't understand how to make multiarch work with a cmake source
[07:58] <lordievader> Good morning.
[08:52] <Riddell> good morning lordievader 
[08:53] <smartboyhw> Good afternoon Riddell 
[08:53] <lordievader> Hey Riddell, smartboyhw. How are you both?
[08:53] <smartboyhw> lordievader, great:)
[08:54] <soee> good morning
[08:54] <lordievader> Hey smartboyhw 
[08:54] <lordievader> Hey soee*
[08:54] <soee> :}
[08:54] <Riddell> lordievader: I'm awesome thanks :)
[08:54] <soee> any idea why nvidia 325 drivers arent by default available for raring ?
[08:55]  * Riddell knows nothing about graphics drivers
[08:56] <smartboyhw> !graphics
[08:56] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about graphics
[08:56] <smartboyhw> :O
[08:56] <smartboyhw> !nvidia
[08:56] <ubottu> For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto
[08:59] <soee> the lates availavle by default version to install is 310 i think 
[08:59] <soee> so to get 225 we have to do it manually or use edgers ppa
[08:59] <soee> *325
[09:00] <yofel> 319 is latest
[09:00] <yofel> you're better of asking in #ubuntu-x for driver really
[09:00] <yofel> *drivers
[09:00] <soee> yofel, for raring ?
[09:00] <soee> let me check
[09:01] <yofel> both x-edgers and x-updates is maintained by them
[09:01] <yofel> 325 will unlikely get into *raring*
[09:01] <yofel> release I mean
[09:01] <soee> i see 313 when open Additional Drivers
[09:01] <soee> and i used edgers to get 325 :)
[09:02] <soee> i think now when we have steam it would be good idea to ship latest stable drivers
[09:04] <yofel> as I said, talk to the X team, all drivers are maintained by them
[10:04] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, speaking of packaging: Try to join the Kubuntu team more actively, then you will see how hard packaging is;P
[10:30] <smartboyhw> yofel, Riddell I forgotten how to pass CMake build options using debian/rules -.-
[10:30] <yofel> usually you override dh_auto_configure and call it with dh_auto_configure -- DSOME_CMAKE_OPTION=FOO
[10:31] <yofel> er, -D, not D
[10:35] <smartboyhw> yofel, alright, I got tests make problems again, sigh
[10:35] <yofel> just disable them as we don't build them for kde stuff
[10:38] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK, i'm having trouble as to how to disable them-.-
[10:39] <smartboyhw> All the normal options don't work
[10:41] <yofel> huh? empty override_dh_auto_test ?
[11:06] <soee> switching animations speed to FAST is much better than defualt one ;)
[11:16]  * apachelogger sighs at kio_sftp 
[11:17] <Riddell> hmm, slight problem in the new plasma-nm packages, doesn't bring in network-manager

[12:16] <Riddell> cyphermox: can I upload network-manager with plasma-nm added to frontend options?
[12:16] <Riddell> from bzr (got some patches you added)
[12:18] <shadeslayer> evening
[12:19] <Riddell> hi shadeslayer, what are you doing this evening?
[12:20] <shadeslayer> Riddell: just going through trello to look what I can do
[12:21] <shadeslayer> ScottK: what's the hold up with ktp?
[12:21]  * Riddell on webkit 2.3.2
[12:22] <shadeslayer> oh
[12:22] <shadeslayer> webkit was ftbfs on ARM
[12:23] <Riddell> cyphermox: uploaded anyway
[12:25]  * shadeslayer works on SRU'ing soprano
[12:25] <shadeslayer> vHanda: do you have a list of things fixed in soprano 2.9.1 to 2.9.3 ?
[12:25] <vHanda> see changlog
[12:25] <shadeslayer> ack
[12:30] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: want to file SRU paperwork for soprano?
[12:37] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, working on a new package...
[12:37] <shadeslayer> okay
[12:41] <shadeslayer> oh
[12:41] <shadeslayer> "make ubiquity popular the package cache,and xapian and kde cache" is more fun than SRU'ing
[12:41]  * shadeslayer takes that yp

[13:14] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yofel Riddell how to deal with http://lintian.debian.org/tags/shlib-without-versioned-soname.html ?
[13:15] <yofel> bundle it with the binary and don't ship headers - and poke upstream to fix it
[13:16] <smartboyhw> yofel, huh, I can't even find any header:P
[13:16] <yofel> then just bundle it with the binary and be done
[13:16] <yofel> that'll probably throw some packagename-doesn't-match-soname warning or so but is the sanest action here
[13:17] <shadeslayer> what yofel said
[13:17] <shadeslayer> if it doesn't have public headers then it's not meant to be split into a different lib
[13:21] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yofel: First time I see such strange copyright: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6028639/
[13:21] <smartboyhw> Need to be approved by KDE e.V -.-
[13:22] <yofel> not strange, that's the kde default license really
[13:22] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh
[13:22] <yofel> for dep-5 that's "GPL2 or 3"
[13:22] <smartboyhw> yofel, :O
[13:23] <smartboyhw> yofel, does it NOT make sense for a .cpp file to have a LGPL copyright, and a .h file to have a GPL copyright?
[13:23] <yofel> you can only use what's approved *right now* there
[13:23]  * smartboyhw doesn't know what is approved *right now*
[13:23] <smartboyhw> yofel, see question above^^^
[13:24] <yofel> well, 2 or 3 are approved, anything later has to be approved by the KDE e.V. first and is currently not relevant
[13:24] <yofel> and mixing licenses like that is pretty nonsense, but in the end it'll be GPL
[13:24] <yofel> it's not invalid
[13:25] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK
[13:36] <cyphermox> Riddell: I still needed to push some more changes, but it's all good
[13:47] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: ping
[13:47] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: IIRC was it you who proposed populating apt cache etc?
[14:01] <smartboyhw> Riddell, maybe we should make a press release on our website to celebrate the 22nd birthday of Linux:P
[14:05] <Riddell> shrug, it's only 1 package out of many thousands we use and 22 doesn't sound like a very significant number somehow
[14:05] <shadeslayer> ^^
[14:06] <smartboyhw> lol
[14:07] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: yofel Riddell currently ubiquity does http://paste.kde.org/pc8e6ea68/
[14:08] <shadeslayer> so it specifically removes the apt-xapian-index
[14:08] <shadeslayer> line 75
[14:08] <BluesKaj> Hey folks
[14:08] <yofel>         # This will be reindexed after installation based on the full
[14:08] <yofel>         # installed sources.list.
[14:08] <yofel> that is by itself fine
[14:09] <yofel> as long as it's done by UBIQUITY
[14:14] <smartboyhw> \o/ http://smartboyhwubuntu.wordpress.com/2013/08/26/happy-22nd-birthday-linux/
[14:21] <shadeslayer> yofel: doubt it
[14:21] <shadeslayer> yofel: it'll probably indexed post boot
[14:31] <yofel> that's exactly what we don't want
[14:34] <shadeslayer> right
[15:28] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, BTW: I have been taught to use << endl after cout << "Hello world" :P
[15:28] <smartboyhw> (Referring to your LinkedIn message)
[15:28] <shadeslayer> heh
[15:28] <shadeslayer> I did not find anything witty to put there
[15:29] <shadeslayer> nooooo
[15:29] <shadeslayer> chrome died
[15:30] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, you know: At the end of term this year we wrote thank-you cards to each teacher, and I wrote a python-style thank you to my computer teacher:P (He is a super maniac of computers and he can hack:O)
[15:30] <shadeslayer> heh
[15:30] <shadeslayer> cool
[15:34] <shadeslayer> yofel: uhm, got a moment?
[15:38] <shadeslayer> ok, nvm
[15:39] <shadeslayer> Riddell: yofel apachelogger http://paste.kde.org/pe253b2b8/
[15:39] <shadeslayer> just a rough idea of how we can do things
[15:40] <shadeslayer> but we don't want to copy things like plasma cache
[15:40] <Riddell> shadeslayer: kde_cache_path = '/home/kubuntu/.kde'  I guess that should be $HOME/.kde or similar
[15:41] <shadeslayer> nope, that's from the live cd
[15:41]  * smartboyhw likes ~ more than $HOME actually, but;P
[15:41] <Riddell> shadeslayer: yeah but the username might change (e.g. in derivatives)
[15:41] <shadeslayer> we're copying the cache from the livecd to the target system right?
[15:41] <shadeslayer> hm
[15:41] <shadeslayer> true
[15:41]  * shadeslayer steals from the function above
[15:42] <Riddell> shadeslayer: what cache is it you want to copy?
[15:42] <Riddell> shadeslayer: I see symlinks pointing to /var/tmp/kdecache-jr /tmp/ksocket-jr /tmp/kde-jr
[15:43] <shadeslayer> ofcourse, like I said, current implementation is just a huge hack, we only want to selectively copy things
[15:43] <Riddell> shadeslayer: might it be more reliable to just run kbuildsycoca in the target chroot?
[15:45] <shadeslayer> mmm
[15:57] <shadeslayer> Riddell: http://paste.kde.org/pd1ab8a7a/
[15:57] <shadeslayer> better?
[15:59] <Riddell> shadeslayer: could be but I guess that's run as root, you'd then need to copy if from /target/root/.kde to /home/<user> I guess
[16:00] <shadeslayer> doh!
[16:00]  * shadeslayer looks
[16:03] <shadeslayer> suppose subprocess.call('chroot', self.target, 'su', self.db.get('passwd/username'), '-c', kde_cache_cmd) is better
[16:05] <Riddell> shadeslayer: could well be, although who knows if all the environment variables will be set right
[16:05] <shadeslayer> should be, atleast that's what is used in other functions
[16:05]  * shadeslayer is checking
[16:07] <shadeslayer> gah
[16:07] <shadeslayer> gah
[16:07] <shadeslayer> Riddell: ubiquity is python3?
[16:07] <shadeslayer> or is it python2
[16:08] <shadeslayer> xnox: ^^
[16:08] <shadeslayer> because the calls to subprocess.call is completely different in python3 as compared to python2
[16:10] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, v
[16:10] <smartboyhw> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/saucy/ubiquity/saucy/view/head:/debian/control
[16:10] <smartboyhw> X-Python3-Version: >= 3.1
[16:10] <smartboyhw> All the build-dep are python3
[16:10] <shadeslayer> 3
[16:10] <shadeslayer> so how does subprocess.call even work :S
[16:10] <shadeslayer> oh
[16:10] <shadeslayer> okay
[16:11] <shadeslayer> just a case of me failing to parse python
[16:12] <Riddell> shadeslayer: python 3 these days
[16:18] <xnox> shadeslayer: python3 only. precise is still python2
[17:18] <Riddell> vUDS tomorrow

[17:19] <Riddell> wednesday has Qt 5.1(.1) migration plans and blockers 
[17:20] <Riddell> thursday has  Flavors Quality Assurance 
[17:47] <ScottK> Riddell: Someone should show up at the Qt one and discuss upstreaming policy.
[19:56] <shadeslayer> Riddell: I'm watching http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0394dg0/hd/BBC_Proms_2013_Season_Doctor_Who_at_the_Proms/ right now
[19:57] <shadeslayer> Riddell: and I wish I could be there :(
[19:57] <shadeslayer> I wonder if they'll do another one like that
