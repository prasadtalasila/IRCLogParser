[10:43] <Omar_> hi every one, please how to change the langage of Inkscape (and only of Inkscape) to english, I'm using kubuntu 13.04, and thank you :)
[10:44] <igalic> Since doing an update, my window decorations are gone, as is transparency and everything else that would be associated with DRI or Open GL.
[10:44] <Omar_> my locale is set to Fr
[10:45] <igalic> I just updated to raring-proposed, and it updated the kernel and all the libgl1-* libraries, but it's still exhibiting the same behaviour.

[12:36] <Toast> Thanks shadeslayer
[12:37] <shadeslayer> Toast: if you have issues, ping us in #kubuntu-devel

[13:11] <thepeopleschamp> i found an icc profile on the internet that is for sure not workin
[13:20] <igalic> btw, I found my issue, the reason why everything was failing in a funny way was because kwin was (accidentally) uninstalled.

[15:12] <skramer_> Hi together. I have Kubuntu 12.10 and KDE 4.11. Everything working well except Amarok 2.8 was crashing. So I asked for assistance in #amarok and they told me to try set Systemsettings->Qt Graphics System to "OpenGL". That stopped Amarok from crashing indeed, but I was unable to use any other application: http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/26/Screen2.png. My graphics card is this: VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset
[15:12] <skramer_>  Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 07) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
[15:14] <skramer_> Is there anything I could do to avoid / solve the problem? How do I correctly activate OpenGL?
[15:15] <BluesKaj> skramer_, check kmenu>applications>system for additional drivers
[15:16] <BluesKaj> skramer_, there might be a more uptodate driver to install that will accommodate both issues 
[15:17] <Mamarok> I dooubt this applies, Intel has not 2 different driver sets
[15:17] <Mamarok> gosh, bad English :(
[15:18] <Mamarok> the additional drivers app is to check for proprietary/free alternatives, doesn't apply for Intel
[15:21] <BluesKaj> well, i'm not an intel user , so i'm not aware whether or not additional or alternate graphics drivers are available 
=== Heis_ is now known as Heis
=== spawn[dead] is now known as spawn57
[15:34] <skramer_> BluesKaj: it says "No additional drivers for this system"...
[15:35] <murlokotan> hi people
[15:43] <BluesKaj> skramer_, do your desktop effects work fine except for the amarok crashes?
[15:44] <skramer_> BluesKaj: Yes, desktop effects are working without problem...
[15:46] <BluesKaj> then it's an amarok issue , not your graphics card or drivers, IMO,  skramer_ 
[15:48] <skramer_> BluesKaj: but they checked the backtrace & found it did not crash in amarok. For them it looked like an OpenGL issue...
[15:48] <loadid_czech> skramer_: have you tried apt-get remove --purge amarok && apt-get install amarok?
[15:49] <skramer_> BluesKaj: Also they say that Amarok´s analyzer uses OpenGL, that´s why they did advise to disable it for the moment...
[15:49] <BluesKaj> well, if amarok is the only app affected , then it's amarok not openGL
[15:50] <BluesKaj> right so amarok can't handle openGL 
[15:51] <skramer_> but what about the problem with other apps after I set QT Graphics Ssytem 
[15:51] <skramer_> to OpenGL. They looked like that http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/26/Screen2.png
[15:52] <BluesKaj> skramer_, in desktop effects >advanced, Qtgraphics system , native or raster?
[15:54] <skramer_> BluesKaj:  it says Composit Type: "OpenGL 3.1" and Qt Graphics System: "Raster"
[15:55] <BluesKaj> skramer_, do you have the openGL 2.0 option ? maybe amarok can handle that 
[15:58] <skramer_> BluesKaj: just tested no and it did have no effect either
[16:00] <BluesKaj> skramer_, no effect ?? still crashing ?
[16:01] <skramer_> BluesKaj: yes, also crashing when I set it to OpenGL 2.0
[16:02] <skramer_> It´s strange Amaorok works when I set Systemsettigs->Qt Graphics System to "OpenGL", which makes all other apps totally unusable as most of them being black same as the snapshot...
[16:06] <BluesKaj> then amarok needs to make the adjustments 
[16:13] <skramer_> I don´t think so, because apps also look like the screen if I start them from CLI with the "--graphicssystem opengl" option
[16:13] <skramer_> that´s nothing to do with amarok...
[16:16] <BluesKaj> interesting skramer_ , it's good that you tracked that down
[16:17] <m_tadeu> how can i have a vpn configured and access outside the vpn for non-vpn resources?
[16:17] <BluesKaj> m_tadeu, torrents ?
[16:18] <m_tadeu> BluesKaj: torrents? what do you mean?
[16:20] <BluesKaj> then i don't understand what you mean by outside vpn sources , vpn acts as a remote server that you can use as another method to access the internet or stored files etc
[16:20] <BluesKaj> mt
[16:21] <DarthFrog> m_tadeu:  Are you currently limited to accessint the VPN only, with no internet access?
[16:21] <BluesKaj> at least that's what I use vpns for
[16:21] <DarthFrog> typo: accessing
[16:22] <m_tadeu> DarthFrog: I have a vpn to connect to my companys network. when I connect to it, I can't access anything outside the vpn
[16:23] <BluesKaj> muast be a cisco 
[16:24] <DarthFrog> m_tadeu:  Then you'll have to speak to whomever admins the VPN to be permitted to access the resources you seek.  
[16:26] <m_tadeu> DarthFrog: There should be a way to make my machine decide if it accesses a resource through the vpn or not, I guess
=== christian is now known as Guest69912
[16:27] <DarthFrog> Ah,  I see.  You need to play with your routing table.
[16:29] <BluesKaj> m_tadeu, so your company denies access to the internet using the vpn as the only resource ?
[16:36] <m_tadeu> BluesKaj: it diesn't deny access....it supplies a gateway to do so....but it's very slow
[16:38] <BluesKaj> m_tadeu, is it the only gateway ?
[16:39] <DarthFrog> m_tadeu:  You need to use the netstat or the route commands to set up your routing.
[16:41] <m_tadeu> BluesKaj: that I know, yes
[16:45] <BluesKaj> maybe DarthFrog's suggestion about setting up a different route ?
[16:50] <m_tadeu> DarthFrog: I can see that I can configure that in the nm plasmoid...I'll try that

[17:25] <tomy76> good evening. I'm having problems with my DVD drive under KDE 4.11.00/Kubuntu 12.04.3. It won't be displayed anymore, but I'm still able to manually (un)mount media from console. I'm uncertain about the cause and don't know where to search. I recently updated KDE via PPA, before there were no problems.
[17:28] <BluesKaj> tomy76,to what does,  ls -l /dev/cdrom , show?
[17:29] <tomy76> BluesKaj, it simple shows, that the access is not possible. There is no /dev/cdrom, but /dev/cdrom1
[17:29] <tomy76> BluesKaj, and it's linked to /dev/sr0
[17:31] <BluesKaj> yes , then you cdrom drive has been given a new assigned name for some reason since /dev/sr0 is correct 
[17:32] <tomy76> but why doesn't KDE recognize it?
[17:33] <tomy76> I can mount any media via console, but for example K3b claims that there is not device
[17:35] <BluesKaj> it doesn't show it dolphin if it contains a disk ?
[17:35] <BluesKaj> in dolphin'
[17:36] <tomy76> no, it doesn't. I insert a media, but there is no reaction, no notification, simply nothing
[17:38] <tomy76> I already tried this command 'inotifywait -m /dev/sr0'. Then I removed the media and reinserted it. it will be shown
[17:38] <tomy76> but there is no reaction in KDE
[17:45] <BluesKaj> tomy76, ok place a disk in the drive , don't close it . in the terminal do , eject -t /dev/cdrom
[17:47] <tomy76> /dev/cdrom can't be found. I assume I should use /dev/cdrom1 instead?

[18:23] <tomy76> I'm going to try to replace udisks with udisks2
[18:26] <BluesKaj> hmm, udisks2 had a problem here yesterday 
[18:28] <BluesKaj> tomy76, I just checked the package manager ..I'm on 13.10 and both udisks and udisks2 are installed by default it seems 
[18:31] <tomy76> BluesKaj, I installed udisks2 now and did a new login on KDE, now it works!
[18:32] <BluesKaj> tomy76, I just checked the package manager ..I'm on 13.10 and both udisks and udisks2 are installed by default it seems 
[18:33] <BluesKaj> tomy76, did you remove udisks ? , hope not becuase it looks lkike you still need it
[18:34] <BluesKaj> \like
[18:34] <tomy76> BluesKaj, I'm on 12.04 but I'm using a Kubuntu PPA. Maybe here is some kind of problem, I don't know. The udisks2 package wasn't selected to install as I did my recent KDE update from 4.10 to 4.11
[18:34] <tomy76> No, I left udisks package installed. aptitude didn't show up any conflicts forcing me to remove it
[18:35] <BluesKaj> tomy76,  yeah kde 4.11 changes the requirements somewhat , I'll try to remember that for ppl who are using older kubuntus
[18:36] <tomy76> Actually, Dolphin shows up my media, newly inserted media were display in the notification area and K3b now finds my drive and recognizes my empty DVD-R, too
[18:38] <m_tadeu> sometimes my swap gets disabled by it self...what can be happening?
[18:39] <tomy76> K3b is currently burning now. BluesKaj, I think we found it. Many thanks for your time!
[18:40] <BluesKaj> tomy76, I'm glad you fixed your problem :)
[18:41] <BluesKaj> m_tadeu, what size swap , and how much RAM ? and is the machine a laptop?
[18:43] <m_tadeu> BluesKaj: the swap is 5GB and mem is 8GB...and yes, it's a laptop
[18:45] <BluesKaj> your swap should be larger than the RAM in order for your laptop to retain it's dat during sleep , m_tadeu
[18:45] <BluesKaj> da t= data
[18:45] <m_tadeu> BluesKaj: damn...yup

[23:55] <sherry> is there any other package?
[23:56] <goguda> sherry: That means none of your repositories have that package. Try installing a .deb file or find a repo that does have it.
