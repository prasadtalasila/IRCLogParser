[00:00] <GiGaHuRtZ> weird, the launchpad says its called homerun, but if I search for it in cache, there is a package, just called something else, ie plasma-widget-homerun or whatever
[00:01] <GiGaHuRtZ> version is correct though, oh well.
[00:02] <alfonsojon> Does anyone know the difference between screenie and kazam?
[00:02] <alfonsojon> I'm not sure which is better
[00:02] <alfonsojon> screenie is QT-based, but Kazam may have more features (Not sure)
[00:02] <alfonsojon> I currently use kazam
[00:03] <GiGaHuRtZ> hmm, homerun reminds me a little of the qml app launcher
[00:05] <alfonsojon> Oh, nevermind
[00:06] <alfonsojon> The beta PPA does have packages
[00:06] <alfonsojon> It's just versioned as 4.10.90
[00:06] <alfonsojon> (not 4.11)
[00:07] <bootkiller> it's how they number beta versions.
[00:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> valorie: thx again for reminding about the meta package, even though the log showed 4 packages removed, it apparently removed a bunch more before I could kill the process
[00:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> alfonsojon: right
[00:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> its what Im using
[00:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> .95
[00:07] <alfonsojon> ah
[00:07] <alfonsojon> do you get lag when saving files with kdialog?
[00:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> no
[00:07] <GiGaHuRtZ> why would i?
[00:08] <GiGaHuRtZ> unless you were saving to a network share, or a drive thats really slow for some odd reason
[00:08] <alfonsojon> I don't know, I got horrid lag in 13.04
[00:08] <alfonsojon> 13.10*
[00:08] <alfonsojon> with KDE 4.11
[00:08] <GiGaHuRtZ> i doubt thats a kde problem
[00:08] <GiGaHuRtZ> it was probably some other issue going on
[00:08] <alfonsojon> kdialog was taking forever to open and I wasn't really sure why
[00:08] <alfonsojon> I downgraded to 13.04 and now it's good
[00:09] <alfonsojon> so if things go wonky, I can always ppa-purge it
[00:09] <alfonsojon> :)
[00:09] <GiGaHuRtZ> I tried 13.10 for a couple days, didnt have any issues such as that
[00:09] <alfonsojon> 13.10 literally seems like 13.04 but improved
[00:09] <GiGaHuRtZ> but it was a little unstable in general
[00:09] <alfonsojon> just a lot smoother
[00:09] <GiGaHuRtZ> I dont have speed issues, donno
[00:09] <alfonsojon> that's what I like about kubuntu
[00:09] <alfonsojon> Every release is just about the same, BUT.
[00:09] <alfonsojon> It's constantly improving without some "radical redesign"
[00:09] <GiGaHuRtZ> And im on a 5 ytear old laptop, but with 8GB of ram
[00:09] <alfonsojon> KDE 3.0 users (should) feel at home in KDE 4.0
[00:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> lol, they didnt originally
[00:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> At all
[00:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> lmao
[00:10] <alfonsojon> I know
[00:10] <alfonsojon> but the general layout is the same
[00:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> Hence why they made KDE 3.5
[00:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> Just liek they are doing with KDE 4.11
[00:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> 4.11 will be the feature freeze for KDE4
[00:10] <GiGaHuRtZ> And from here on out, bug fixes and siuch only
[00:11] <alfonsojon> Oh really?
[00:11] <GiGaHuRtZ> So when they come out with KDE5, people can use KDE4.11 for stability
[00:11] <alfonsojon> ah
[00:11] <alfonsojon> Gotta love KDE
[00:11] <GiGaHuRtZ> Ya, its how they did it with KDE4 also, with 3.5 being the stable branch
[00:11] <alfonsojon> I've always been a Unity/Gnome Fallback user
[00:11] <alfonsojon> I've been using Ubuntu since 9.04
[00:11] <GiGaHuRtZ> I've only really been using KDE4 for like a month
[00:11] <alfonsojon> I switched to KDE recently, and wow
[00:12] <alfonsojon> I don't think I can ever go back
[00:12] <alfonsojon> People call it bloated but it's so much smoother than Unity
[00:12] <alfonsojon> and it's a lot more customizable.
[00:12] <alfonsojon> I can have wobbly windows and the desktop cube easily
[00:12] <alfonsojon> on my entry level GPU from 2009
[00:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> I used kde3.5, then gnome2, then xfce, then gnome3 (i hate unity), then mate, and now kde4, and its by far the best desktop experience I have ever had with linux in over 13 years
[00:13] <alfonsojon> and still get 30 FPS in Minecraft
[00:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> eh, ya compiz doesnt take much for a gpu
[00:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> I was running compiz on intel gfx in 2007
[00:13] <alfonsojon> Also, have you tried Wayland?
[00:13] <alfonsojon> oh boy
[00:13] <alfonsojon> xD
[00:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> I have, barely
[00:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> It renders the windows much smoother
[00:13] <alfonsojon> is it in a usable state?
[00:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> Like moving windows for example
[00:13] <GiGaHuRtZ> No idea
[00:14] <alfonsojon> Alright
[00:14] <GiGaHuRtZ> Its usable, but I dont think any window managers fullly support it yet, donno
[00:14] <alfonsojon> The noveau drivers work beautifully with my GPU, so I think I can ditch proprietary drivers to grab X11
[00:14] <GiGaHuRtZ> I had some things like xterm and such working, that was it, heh
[00:14] <alfonsojon> Kwin in 4.11 adds just-about-complete support for Wayland
[00:14] <GiGaHuRtZ> Yup
[00:14] <wxl> here you guys are talking about games and i read wayward and not wayland
[00:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> 13.10 wont be going to mir
[00:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> games?
[00:15] <wxl> well, minecraft at least :)
[00:15] <bootkiller> partial, it only runs on xwayland for now...
[00:15]  * GiGaHuRtZ doesnt really play games :-/
[00:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> og
[00:15] <GiGaHuRtZ> oh
[00:15] <wxl> i don't play games much btu i do love me some nethack
[00:16] <alfonsojon> lol
[00:16] <alfonsojon> If I'm not mistaken
[00:16] <alfonsojon> XWayland is just the X11 server running as a Wayland extension, right?
[00:17] <bootkiller> yes, but still isn't native wayland
[00:17] <alfonsojon> is it faster than normal Xorg at least?
[00:18] <bootkiller> haven't seen comparisons so far
[00:18] <alfonsojon> alrighty then.
[00:19] <alfonsojon> how does one install wayland?
[00:19] <GiGaHuRtZ> it feels faster imho
[00:19] <GiGaHuRtZ> alfonsojon: just google dude
[00:19] <alfonsojon> good idea
[00:19] <alfonsojon> xD
[00:25] <GiGaHuRtZ> anyone here familiar with cifs/smbfs automounting with fstab?
[00:26] <GiGaHuRtZ> The reason I ask is, the share I use is not protected by username/passwd at all (its running of embedded linux router like a nas with no permissions)
[00:27] <GiGaHuRtZ> I didnt put the password field in the fstab, only a user (i was thinking that was required but cannot) remember, and when doing a mount -a, it asked for a password
[00:30] <IdleOne> Why don't you try googling it?
[00:32] <alfonsojon> Is there a way to apply the blur effect to the transparency effect?
[00:35] <GiGaHuRtZ> IdleOne: I figured it out on my own, I had just never seen the password prompt like that
[00:36] <GiGaHuRtZ> alfonsojon: heh, did you comment on ubuntuupdates.org by chance? I just loaded that site, and I looked in the righthand bar, and under recent comments is someone with your name, heh

[08:36] <lordievader> Good morning.
[08:51] <MarkusS> anyone knows what happend to kdenlive? and kdenlive.org?
[08:51] <MarkusS> down for a while and some filters stopped working for me
[08:53] <smartboyhw> MarkusS, go to #kdenlive might be a better idea.
[08:53] <valorie> MarkusS: they devels are working on moving the site to kde infra
[08:53] <valorie> the, I mean
[08:53] <valorie> I'm sure it will redirect once it's all done
[08:54] <valorie> but smartboyhw is right
[08:54] <MarkusS> k thx
[09:28] <alebaby> hola
[09:29] <alebaby> buenas noches
[09:29] <lordievader> Hey alebaby
[09:30] <alebaby> you read spanish ?
[09:30] <lordievader> !spanish | alebaby
[09:30] <ubottu> alebaby: En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #ubuntu-es; escriba "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y presione intro.
[09:31] <alebaby> good no matter
[09:31] <alebaby> good night lordievader ;)
[09:32] <alebaby> I'm glad you found
[09:32] <alebaby> I have a serious problem
[09:32] <lordievader> What problem are you facing?
[09:33] <alebaby> my problem is that I can not install any kubuntu in netbook and notebook
[09:33] <alebaby> and the truth and not to do :(
[09:33] <lordievader> Why not? Are you getting errors?
[09:34] <alebaby> look lets you tell
[09:35] <alebaby> install kubuntu 12.04.2 a Mexican brand lanix
[09:35] <alebaby> and it turns out that the version of Kubuntu 12.04.1 wifi works really well
[09:36] <alebaby> but when I update and installed the version 12.04.2 wifi stops working completely
[09:37] <alebaby> but now I do the same with a acer and it turns out the graphics card fails and will not let me install any driver
[09:37] <lordievader> alebaby: Have you tried the jockey (jockey-kde or jockey-text), you might need a closed source driver.
[09:38] <alebaby> for they are all intel
[09:39] <alebaby> That has something to do?
[09:39] <lordievader> Hmm that should just work out of the box. Is there a specific reason for installing Precise? Else you could try Raring (13.04).
[09:40] <alebaby> with that I can not watch video on youtube or videos inside the pc
[09:40] <alebaby> I'll tell you
[09:41] <alebaby> I try to, kubuntu 11.10, 12.04.1, 12.04.2, 13.04 just need to try kubuntu 12.10
[09:43] <alebaby> and then if you try with this version and does not work and not to do u.u
[09:44] <lordievader> alebaby: Have you installed flash? (Might explain why you cannot watch videos on Youtube)
[09:44] <alebaby> yes
[09:44] <alebaby> if you installed the flash and not get stuck
[09:48] <alebaby> but all that I'm mentioned, only about netbook and notebook computers
[09:49] <alebaby> with laptops, the whole system works perfectly
[09:55] <alebaby> thanks lordievader  I'll take care of yourself and thanks
[09:55] <alebaby> bye
[10:21] <vadrao> Any nice application to help me concentrate (pomodoro technique) for KDE?
[11:07] <izanagi> hello, can i ask a question?
[11:09] <izanagi> when i was using 12.04 i was able to turn of my wifi card using FN+F2. In 13.04(clean install) this key combination works, but turns off wifi only by software means. Is there a solution?
[11:18] <vadrao> izanagi: I am not sure if this could be a proper solution. But I suggest messingt with System Settings> Shortcuts and Gestures
[11:19] <izanagi> issue is present in ubuntu and kubuntu. I dont think these setting will help, but anything is worth trying

[12:32] <Captain_Proton> ? I am looking to replace win8 on my desktop. The question I have is, it has a Radeon HD 7570 in the pass ati drivers sucked is that still the case? I know with Steam and Canical putting presser on them to fix thier driver or they any better? I looking to play StarCraft 2 and vendatta online by star citizen when it is released
[12:44] <ss_haze> Captain_Proton, first, it's easy to set Ubuntu in dual boot, so you can still do windows stuff (I don't)
[12:45] <Captain_Proton> ss_haze: I know but yuk Windows lol
[12:47] <Captain_Proton> i know vendatta is linux native and star craft 2 runs fine in wine in the pass I had nvidia card their card work OK in linux. ati not so much, I was wondering if their better now
[13:03] <izanagi> when i was using 12.04 i was able to turn of my wifi card using FN+F2. In 13.04(clean install) this key combination works, but turns off wifi only by software means. Is there a solution? Maybe i should revert to kernel used in 12.04?
[13:03] <BluesKaj> nvidia has better support in linux than ati , but that depends on the ati card some are very good , other snot so good
[13:03] <BluesKaj> Captain_Proton,^
[13:07] <izanagi> yea, ati is pain in the ass
[13:07] <Pici> The fglrx-legacy drivers that can be found in a PPA have worked well for me.
[13:08] <izanagi> they work, but are not ideal when it comes to full hd movies or hdmi

[14:40] <BluesKaj> reverting the kernel is not good policy , it may affect other kernel modules negatively , izanagi , unfortunately i haven't got any suggestions for a fix

[23:02] <nescius> hello
[23:03] <nescius> I have plenty of errors with apt-get and missing links to stuff like changelog.Debian.gz while updating packages, did anyone have same?
[23:04] <valorie> nescius: do you think the errors are at your end, or Debian's end?
[23:05] <nescius> valorie, those are packages from almost unmodified instalation of raring kubuntu x86_64
[23:05] <valorie> you might post your errors to a pastebin
[23:05] <nescius> for example libkactivities6 4:4.10.3-0ubuntu0.1~ubuntu13.04
[23:06] <valorie> hard to discuss 'errors' without know what they are
[23:06] <nescius> valorie: locale is wrong..
[23:06] <nescius> i will do so, but have to google a bit later tomorrow.. but thanks anyway
[23:07] <gustavo_brazil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6drk48mOig&feature=youtu.be
[23:07] <gustavo_brazil> this is a great distro
[23:07] <nescius> gustavo_brazil: this is kubuntu
[23:08] <gustavo_brazil> nescius: ¬_¬
[23:08] <nescius> so please go advertise somewhere not here ;)
[23:09] <gustavo_brazil> nescius: I tell you the same :)
[23:18] <nescius> here is a log from my apt problem http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=GEXcpj0J
[23:19] <nescius> basicaly link of one file in a package marked for upgrade links to nowhere
[23:20] <nescius> this results in error and so the package is never upgraded. this is happening often (I had at least 4 such cases before - solution was to delete the link and create a new empty file in its place)
[23:22] <nescius> i am merely wondering if you had such experiences, is this bad packaging? I was trying to use muon for most of the work, but it is only a frontend for apt right?
[23:22] <valorie> someone recently had a similar problem on the kubuntu list
[23:23] <valorie> it could be a packaging error
[23:23] <valorie> I guess writing to the list is the only way to be sure
[23:24] <valorie> or filing a bug report
[23:24] <nescius> thanks, i will check the package and who did this version of the package and send them a polite mail
[23:24] <nescius> tomorrow
[23:24] <nescius> good nigth
