[07:45] <smartboyhw> SYMBOLS AGAIN>>>>>>
[07:47] <yofel> for what?
[07:48] <yofel> good morning btw.
[07:53] <smartboyhw> yofel, 12.10
[07:53] <smartboyhw> kde4libs
[07:53] <smartboyhw> Good afternoon
[07:53] <yofel> ignoreit
[07:53] <smartboyhw> yofel, boing!?
[07:53] <smartboyhw> ignoreit?
[07:53] <yofel> you can't maintain symbol files for different gcc versions
[07:53] <yofel> also, the boost version etc. is different
[07:53] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK
[07:54] <smartboyhw> Waiting all to build then...\
[07:55] <smartboyhw> Good thing I can debsign *.dsc and dput ppa:kubuntu-ppa/staging *.changes (LOL)\
[07:55] <smartboyhw> yofel, one thing
[07:55] <smartboyhw> Any packager: Is -dbg package necessary when there's a lot of debug-file-with-no-debug-symbols lintian warning appearing?
[07:56] <agateau> Quintasan: no I have a X1 carbon, but its keyboard is similar to other recent Lenovo laptops
[07:59] <yofel> smartboyhw: that's about something else http://lintian.debian.org/tags/debug-file-with-no-debug-symbols.html
[07:59] <smartboyhw> yofel, and I can't understand the page, sorry:p
[07:59] <smartboyhw> I did read it, but...
[08:00] <yofel> the packages split the debug information out of the binaries into a seperate file (to make them smaller), what that warning tells you is that the new seperate debug file doesn't actually appear to contain any debugging information
[08:00] <yofel> i.e. it's probably useless
[08:00] <yofel> I can't really say what's wrong (or if anything is wrong) without actually looking at such a file
[08:01] <smartboyhw> yofel, it's the new plasma-mediacenter
[08:01] <yofel> well, if you upload it somewhere I could try to build and look at it in the evening. Right now I'm at work and can't do packaging
[08:02] <smartboyhw> yofel, OK. I will upload to main PPA.
[08:02] <smartboyhw> Basically everything is OK except this strange lintian
[08:02] <smartboyhw> warning
[08:02] <smartboyhw> Not strange but
[08:02] <smartboyhw> No dbg symbols hmm
[08:05] <smartboyhw> Damn, my main PPA was oversized
[08:05] <smartboyhw> :O
[08:10] <smartboyhw> yofel, it's in https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/2buntu/+files/plasma-mediacenter_1.0.90-0ubuntu1.dsc
[08:11] <yofel> thanks
[08:18] <Quintasan> agateau: Ah I  see, well welcome to the club anyways. I would throw some bricks at whoever thought PrntScr button there is a good idea
[08:19] <agateau> Quintasan: :)
[08:19] <agateau> Quintasan: it is the reason $DEITY blessed us with Xmodmap :)
[08:20] <Quintasan> Totally.
[08:20] <Quintasan> Anyways, I'm KIND OF late for work
[08:36] <lordievader> Good morning.
[08:40] <lordievader> Is it known that in the ppa:neon/kf5 the package project-neon5-kde-workspace failed to build? Wanted to try it out but the dependencies of project-neon5-session were unmet because of the build failure.
=== vinay is now known as Guest57446
[08:44] <smartboyhw> lordievader, I think so...
[08:44] <yofel> lordievader: upstream is changing so much currently that it's pretty much a gamble whether the package builds or not
[08:46] <yofel> yeah, that's broken code
[08:49] <lordievader> Ok, well I'll check back later to see if there is a sucessfull build ;)
[08:56] <apachelogger> did someone just trigger workspace? Oo
[08:56] <yofel> did we both trigger it?
[08:56] <smartboyhw> oO
[08:57] <apachelogger> I am doing a raring rebuild, dunno what you are doing :P
[08:57] <yofel> I clicked on 'Build now', which triggered another one for raring it seems
[08:57] <smartboyhw> LOL
[09:02] <lordievader> Hehe
[09:06] <Riddell> smartboyhw: calligra is out, we should get a story onto kubuntu.org, have you checked the backports?
[09:07] <smartboyhw> Riddell, uh first thing: Please change my Planet KDE thing to smartboyhwubuntu.wordpress.org
[09:07] <smartboyhw> And let me check the backports
[09:07] <Riddell> nothing at smartboyhwubuntu.wordpress.org
[09:08] <smartboyhw> Riddell, damn it's .com
[09:08] <smartboyhw> And I think Quantal and Precise failed.
[09:08] <smartboyhw> Ah, libopencolorio-dev
[09:08] <smartboyhw> damn
[09:08]  * Riddell said something about quantal not being worth it
[09:09] <smartboyhw> Riddell, you did:P
[09:10] <smartboyhw> But Quantal's support period is longer than Raring, don't forget
[09:10] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I might give you a hackergotchi later;P
[09:10] <smartboyhw> What's the size requirement again?
[09:11] <yofel> support period isn't really about the backports though, precise is the first release where we decided to do some updates for CURRENT-2 because it's LTS
[09:11] <yofel> but sure, if you want to do packages for quantal, go ahead
[09:12] <Riddell> smartboyhw: planet updated, hackergotchi at 80x80 pixels a photo headshot on transparent background preferred
[09:12] <smartboyhw> Riddell, got it:)
[09:14] <smartboyhw> Riddell, oh wait
[09:17] <smartboyhw> Riddell, use http://smartboyhwubuntu.wordpress.com/category/planet-kde/feed/?mrss=off instead
[09:24] <Riddell> voila
[09:32] <smartboyhw> Ouch, my webcam doesn't work

[09:57] <xnox> Riddell: agateau: ubiquity fails adt tests in jenkins https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/job/saucy-adt-ubiquity/128/ARCH=i386,label=adt/console
[09:57]  * xnox ponders what did I do wrong....
[09:59] <xnox> Riddell: agateau: never mind.... jenkins is borked, testing 2.15.13 with 2.15.12 installed.
[09:59] <agateau> xnox: ok, no pb
[10:15] <smartboyhw> Riddell, uploaded ~ppa2 for quantal and precise, but plz expect quantal to build slower (since 4.10.97 is building)
[10:15] <smartboyhw> ~ppa2 = calligra 2.7.1
[10:16] <smartboyhw> Anyone interested in Python plz help with http://noskcaj10.wordpress.com/2013/08/02/announcing-the-testdrive-hackfest/
[10:17] <yofel> the builders don't have release-specific queues, so they'll build equally slow
[10:17] <smartboyhw> Yeah
[10:17] <smartboyhw> Eh, done anyway, what else TODO?
[10:21] <soee> riddle
[10:21] <smartboyhw> BTW, Riddell please tell me why Calligra is still stuck in -propoesd
[10:21] <smartboyhw> *-proposed
[10:22] <soee> yesterday for the first time my Kubuntu saucy stopped working :/ had to reboot as there was no response
[10:22] <soee> laso from time to time there is total plasma crash but this is related to latest KDE
[10:22] <smartboyhw> :O
[10:22] <smartboyhw> Hmm.......
[10:22] <smartboyhw> 4.10.97 should be more stable than 4.10.95.
[10:22] <soee> nope
[10:23] <soee> i woinder if this has anything to do with my wireless
[10:25] <smartboyhw> soee, wireless?
[10:25] <smartboyhw> That shouldn't cause a TOTAL plasma crash
[10:27] <debfx> smartboyhw: calligra (1:2.7.0-0ubuntu2 to 1:2.7.1-0ubuntu1) Depends: calligra poppler
[10:27] <smartboyhw> poppler?
[10:27] <debfx> yes
[10:29] <smartboyhw> Maybe it's stuck on the new poppler ver. in -proposed
[10:31] <smartboyhw> debfx, um can you try to explain to me how that happenes/
[10:32] <debfx> like you said, it built against the new poppler version in -proposed
[10:33] <smartboyhw> And it was fried. Hmm
[10:36] <soee> smartboyhw, more specific - maybe networkmanager
[10:36] <smartboyhw> networkmanager?!
[10:36] <smartboyhw> oops
[10:36] <smartboyhw> Really?
[10:41] <smartboyhw> debfx, what can I do to solve that problem then?
[10:41] <debfx> smartboyhw: find out why poppler doesn't migrate :)
[10:42] <debfx> some packages probably need to be rebuilt
[10:42] <smartboyhw> debfx, ouch
[10:42] <smartboyhw> debfx, well at least poppler builts perfectly on all arch
[10:42] <smartboyhw> Where do you get that calligra (1:2.7.0-0ubuntu2 to 1:2.7.1-0ubuntu1) Depends: calligra poppler BTW?
[10:43] <smartboyhw> debfx, got it. poppler new binary
[10:43] <smartboyhw> NEW 
[10:43] <smartboyhw> OUCH
[10:46] <Quintasan> Well, almost 8 millions
[10:46] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, ?

[10:47] <Quintasan> I estimate that things will die off at $20M
[10:48] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, +1
[11:46] <BluesKaj> 'Morning folks
[12:34] <smartboyhw> Hmm, somebody give me proper explanations of why https://launchpadlibrarian.net/146474240/buildlog_ubuntu-quantal-amd64.calligra_1%3A2.7.1-0ubuntu1~ubuntu12.10~ppa2_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz will happen in quantal ...
[12:35] <smartboyhw> Not even made...
[12:35] <smartboyhw> Maybe because of no opencolorio?
[12:35] <smartboyhw> And no vc?
[12:36] <smartboyhw> Ah, yes, opencolorio
[12:39] <smartboyhw> Hmm, either I'm stupid, or I just can't find that .so file.
[12:40] <yofel> well, it's not built without opencolorio
[12:40] <yofel> krita/plugins/extensions/dockers/CMakeLists.txt:
[12:40] <yofel> if(HAVE_OCIO AND HAVE_GLEW)
[12:40] <yofel>     add_subdirectory(lut)
[12:40] <smartboyhw> yofel, hmm?
[12:41] <smartboyhw> I mean, in quantal
[12:41] <yofel> what so file do you mean?
[12:41] <smartboyhw> yofel, kritalutdocker.so
[12:41] <yofel> well, it wasn't built, so how can it be there?
[12:41] <smartboyhw> Can't exist WITHOUT using libopencolorio
[12:41] <yofel> or do you mean the archive package?
[12:42] <smartboyhw> yofel, quantal buildlog see above
[12:42] <yofel> yes, the file is not there because you built without opencolorio
[12:43] <yofel> easiest fix would probably be to just backport opencolorio
[12:43] <smartboyhw> yofel, no I mean it doesn't exist in .install files
[12:43] <yofel> oh
[12:43]  * yofel looks again
[12:45] <yofel> smartboyhw: uh, that's some "fun" architecture-specific stuff in debian/rules
[12:46] <yofel> probably because of glew
[12:51] <smartboyhw> yofel, meh meh meh
[12:55] <yofel> well, it kind of makes sense
[12:55] <yofel> the alternative would be to maintain install files for specific architectures
[12:56] <yofel> a few lines in rules are less maintenance work
[12:56] <smartboyhw> yofel, HOWTO fix?:P
[12:57] <yofel> backport opencolorio if possible, otherwise delete the stuff from rules
[12:57] <yofel> (latter is more work later on, unless we find a good way to make backport hooks for non-kdesc packages)
[13:01] <smartboyhw> yofel, backport opencolorio then
[13:03] <smartboyhw> DAMN
[13:04] <smartboyhw> I filled in everyrhing precise, but filled in the series quantal...
[13:04] <smartboyhw> HELP
[13:04] <yofel> heh
[13:04] <smartboyhw> DELEETTEETETE
[13:16] <ScottK> smartboyhw: Did you see amarok migrated?
[13:16] <ScottK> Forcing is almost never the right answer.  It's better to figure out why it didn't migrate.
[13:19] <smartboyhw> ScottK, no I didn't;P
[13:19] <smartboyhw> Oh you mean Amarok then yes
[13:19] <ScottK> It did.
[13:19] <smartboyhw> ScottK, what's the reason BTW?
[13:19] <ScottK> The old armhf binaries were blocking.
[13:19] <ScottK> When I removed the amarok binary, I forgot amarok-dbg and amarok-utils.
[13:19] <smartboyhw> ScottK, AH AH AH
[13:20] <smartboyhw> GOt it
[13:20] <ScottK> Did anyone merger your kubuntu-defaults change?
[13:20] <ScottK> I can do it today.
[13:22] <smartboyhw> ScottK, dunnop
[13:23] <ScottK> Nope.  Will do it.
[13:24] <smartboyhw> I don't think so
[13:24] <smartboyhw> ScottK, and plz plz approve my ibus-cangjie SRU
[13:24] <smartboyhw> ScottK, :)
[13:24] <ScottK> I can probably do that later today.
[13:25] <smartboyhw> Hmm, sounded like I need to backport libsoprano-dev
[13:25] <smartboyhw> for 4.10.97
[13:27] <smartboyhw> Done

[14:27] <Riddell> I just dropped opencolorio from precise backport
[14:27] <smartboyhw> Riddell, .......
[14:28] <smartboyhw> Hmm, that's a problem
[14:29] <smartboyhw> Now I really have to touch debian/rules for calligra backport
[14:31] <Riddell> why?
[14:32] <ScottK> tsdgeos: It's not just Digikam anymore remember.  It's the "Digikam Software Collection".  Of course it's huge.

[15:16] <smartboyhw> yofel, yeah
[15:16] <smartboyhw> The problem: The hype has died down.
[15:18] <yofel> not sure if it has. It's just that everyone that really wanted to spend the money already did it. (or missed the cheaper perks)
