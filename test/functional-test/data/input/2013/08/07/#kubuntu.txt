[08:08] <_droid> hello people, I want to install kubuntu onto my newly purchased thinkpad E330, so I made a usb installer with kubuntu on it, no ponblem. Reaching the boot menu of my laptop no problem, and my usb stick was listed there. When choosing the usb to boot from, the boot menu disappears and then I get back to the boot menu again. And this happens every time when I choose the usb stick to boot from.
[08:08] <_droid> any ideas
[08:08] <_droid> ??
[08:59] <yossarianuk> hi - does anyone know of any good benchmark tools to compare Windows vs Linux Disk performance?
[09:00] <yossarianuk> phoronix = barely any Windows tests work.
[09:15] <Walex> yossarianuk: you cannot do tht comparison reliably unless you are *very* skilled.
[09:16] <Walex> yossarianuk: however, I think that the FIO tool, which is one of the best if used right, and most defaults are sensible, may be available on MS-Windows too.
[09:18] <Walex> it will surely work with Cygwin of course, but the emulation layer adds a bit of overhead, even if I reckon very little
[09:19] <Walex> yossarianuk: you get lucky: MS-Windows binaries for it are available: http://www.bluestop.org/fio/
[09:21] <Walex> _droid: your bootable USB stick is not setup right...
[09:21] <Walex> _droid: I much prefer to use USB CD/DVD drives anyhow
[09:25] <SilverCode> does anyone know where the $TZ environment variable is set in Kubuntu?
[09:36] <_droid> Walex: well the problem is that the laptop does not have a cdrom

[09:38] <Walex> _droid: that's why I wrote "USB CD/DVD drives"
[09:38] <Walex> _droid: very useful also for backup or watching movies.
[09:39] <Walex> _droid: I have even got a slim USB2 BluRray drive.
[09:39] <Walex> _droid: anyhow it could also be that you have chosen the wrong type of device for the USB stick in the boot menu of the BIOS
[09:53] <_droid> Walex: at the time when I get to the boot menu my usb stick was already inserted and listed correctly in the boot list
[09:59] <Walex> _droid: it depends on "correctly". Many BIOSes can handle different types of USB peripherals (e.g. ZIP drive, mass storage, CD, ...)
[10:00] <_droid> Walex: ok I will see to it
[10:13] <yossarianuk> Walex: thanks
[10:19] <apoz> i often make my computer "sleep" with: dbus-send --system --print-reply     --dest="org.freedesktop.UPower"     /org/freedesktop/UPower     org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend
[10:20] <apoz> unfortunately on resume, i don't get prompted for password, how can i fix that?
[10:36] <Walex> start a screensaver and then run that
[10:39] <yossarianuk> this is a bit of a random one an potentially offtopic...
[10:40] <yossarianuk> does anyone know if you can connect a Windows IIS server -> external Linux coldfusion server ?
[11:01] <yofel> yossarianuk: #ubuntu-server might be able to answer that
[11:01] <yossarianuk> yofel: thanks
[11:43] <kbroulik> hi I wanted to try out project neon kf5 but it always says project-neon5-kde-workspace doesn't exist although on the neon5 ppa page it clearly does
[11:52] <OerHeks> kbroulik, it was added a few hours ago https://launchpad.net/~neon/+archive/kf5 odd
[11:54] <smartboyhw> OerHeks, kbroulik um it's because it continously failed to build....
[11:55] <smartboyhw> We will fix;)
[11:56] <OerHeks> thank you, smartboyhw
[11:59] <kbroulik> smartboyhw: ok, cool :)
[12:02] <yofel> kbroulik: you're probably on raring, which sadly doesn't yet have a successful kde-workspace build, we'll see what we can do
[12:02] <EvilRoey> hi
[12:03] <kbroulik> yofel: yes, raring
[12:04] <EvilRoey> on my Quantal desktop at home, I've upgraded to the latest available KDE packages.  A bug I found is that the screen edges, despite lighting up when I move the mouse pointer to them, don't trigger the desktop effects that I've configured... how can I diagnose this
[12:04] <EvilRoey> (I'm thinking dbus foo)
[12:04] <EvilRoey> (dbus-fu)
[12:44] <Walex> EvilRoey: it is almost always too complicated, don't even try
[12:45] <Walex> EvilRoey: unless you are a KDE developer that is.
[12:58] <EvilRoey> Walex:  ahaha
[12:58] <EvilRoey> ok
[12:58] <EvilRoey> thanks :)
[12:58] <EvilRoey> I've asked on the kde channel too, no one responded

[15:28] <BluesKaj> hmm, whynot kubuntu manual , the desktops are totally different , so i don't understand why they keep subbing ubuntu for kubuntu in the factoids
[15:28] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, is there a Kubuntu manual in the first place?
[15:31] <BluesKaj> there's one here , http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Kubuntu_Raring , it should be included in the factoids
[15:31] <BluesKaj> and why does it have to be under ubuntu guide ?
[15:31] <Pici> BluesKaj: We're not psychic, if no one suggests a factoid for it, we're likely not going to create one.

[15:32] <BluesKaj> Pici, don't tqake it personally , all the search engines do the same thing
[15:34] <BluesKaj> I'm becoming annoyed , when the 2 OSs have become so different , there should be more distinction between them , not kubuntu being a subset of ubuntu '
[15:36] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, well we're already working on our documentation already (led by ahoneybun)
[15:36] <smartboyhw> So plz be patient
[15:38] <BluesKaj> smartboyhw, I don't need to be told to be patient
[15:38] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, well obviously since you are annoyed..
[15:38] <smartboyhw> OK, weird why is there so many cgcfir?
[15:39] <BluesKaj> of course I'm annoyed , but that does preclude patience , Ive been patient all along so ....
[15:41] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, just don't get annoyed, we will have doc:)
