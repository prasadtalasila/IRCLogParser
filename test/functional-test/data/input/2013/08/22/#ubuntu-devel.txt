[04:39] <infinity> RAOF: Before you ask, I'm fixing libmirclient2 right now.
[04:39] <RAOF> In what way fixing?
[04:40] <RAOF> I thought all that needed to happen was a nice rebuild of the xserver and then everything would magically propagate out of -proposed?
[04:40] <infinity> RAOF: You didn't notice your xorg-server FTBFS mails, I guess. :P
[04:41] <RAOF> I did indeed just notice them
[04:41] <RAOF> I'm missing my amd64 FTBFS email, though :)
[04:41] <infinity> Should be all better now.  Retrying them.
[04:41] <infinity> amd64 hadn't started yet. :P

[05:08] <RAOF> That'll teach me for trusting the... oh. That branch hasn't landed yet.
[05:08] <RAOF> No, it must have. Because that's what bumped the ABI.
[05:09] <RAOF> Ah. So when the documentation says "use mir_display_output_invalid" what it actually means is "BWA HA HA!"
[05:09] <infinity> I get those two phrases confused often, myself.
[05:10] <infinity> I think it's because they rhyme.

[07:15] <Mirv> can some core-dev say 'ack' if packaging change ubuntu-keyboard http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/6013052/ looks ok to you, too? (daily publishing process)
[07:40] <pitti> Mirv: LGTM
[07:42] <Mirv> thanks, publishing services stack then
[07:43] <Mirv> there'd be another one from kenvandine and robru renaming a package and adding C/R/P for the old package - mixed inside wrap-and-sort, though http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/6013101/
[07:44] <Mirv> (this is btw practicing for the fact that didier will be away for the next two weeks)
[07:47] <dholbach> good morning
[07:53] <pitti> Mirv: no vacation for didrocks! :-)
[07:53] <didrocks> yeah, that should be forbidden, who authorized that? :p
[08:00] <Mirv> so, if another core-dev has time for a small glance, an 'ack' for http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/6013101/ (qml-friends packaging change) would be welcome
[08:01] <pitti> yay for reordering everything and making the diff really hard to read..
[08:04] <pitti> Mirv: dropping of qtdeclarative5-test-plugin build-dep is deliberate? the changelog doesn't mention it (or the reordering, or standrad-version bump, etc.)
[08:05] <pitti> Mirv: nevermind, it was a duplicate
[08:05] <Mirv> pitti: yeah, mixed in wrap-and-sort
[08:06] <Mirv> what truly happened was http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~super-friends/qml-friends/trunk/revision/49 + R/C/P additions (+ wrap-and-sort)
[08:07] <pitti> Mirv: the diff looks ok to me after ignoring the re-sorting, but note that you need a transitional package for clean upgrades
[08:07] <pitti> sometimes it works without one, but it's way too easy to confuse apt by not having one, so I strongly suggest adding it
[08:08] <pitti> Mirv: why does it need renaming in the first place?
[08:08] <infinity> If something else is depending on the new package (always), then you don't need the transitional package.
[08:08] <infinity> It's if your package is a leaf that you must have one.
[08:08] <infinity> s/that/then/
[08:08] <pitti> infinity: that's what I thought, too; but I've seen upgrades being stuck without one
[08:09] <Mirv> pitti: there's a new policy of having versioned qml plugins like that, so that when API changes the package name will also change
[08:09] <infinity> pitti: apt shouldn't get stuck if one upgrades, say, friends-app, and it depends on the new plugin, and it has a proper CPR triple against the old.
[08:10] <infinity> pitti: It's when people use the wrong relationships that it goes sideways.
[08:10] <infinity> pitti: Or accidentally depend and conflict with themselves (see the cups mess I unwound over the weekend).
[08:11] <Mirv> seb128: related to above, do you know/remember how the new QML plugin naming policy came to be, I've been only told about it?
[08:11] <infinity> Anyhow, given that this stuff is all new to saucy anyway, I'd let it pass without a transitional package, and if there are reports of breakage, one can be added.  But I hate having mid-cycle cruft if it's not necessary.
[08:11] <pitti> ack
[08:12] <seb128> Mirv, I don't know, it's just kenvandine who told me it was decided to use name<version> after they found how to make different abi co-installable
[08:12] <infinity> (Now, if someone had installed it on its own as a leaf package, that will break miserably for them, but the odds of that on anything but some random developer's machine seem very, very low)
[08:13] <Mirv> seb128: right, it was about that making different abi co-installable
[08:13] <infinity> Given that none of this is seeded, it's pretty wildly undiscoverable, etc, I highly doubt anyone other than Ken might have installed it manually.
[08:14] <infinity> Mirv: So, ack on that diff from me.  Watch for reports of upgrade breakage and be prepared to add a transitional package if it turns out you broke the world, but it should all be Just Fine.

[08:49] <darkxst> pitti, cjwatson, so I am trying to run gnome-shell under ubiquity-dm, however there doesnt seem to be a logind session for that? and gnome-shell isnt real happy about that ;(
[08:50] <Laney> that's an xnox thing
[08:50] <Laney> also known
[08:51] <darkxst> Laney, is there a bug for that?
[08:51] <Laney> not sure
[08:52] <xnox> darkxst: running gnome-shell under ubiquity-dm sounds backwards.  bug #1214732 is sensible -> auto-login into gnome-shell with a profile to just start ubiquity as a normal app. But then you'd need to hack "try ubuntu-gnome" button to do something sensible, e.g. make gnome-shell load the rest of stuff / relogin into normal profile

[08:53] <xnox> darkxst: logind bug is bug #1178638
[08:53] <ubottu> bug 1178638 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Saucy) "Exception in GTK frontend when attempting to connect to wifi: no logind support" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1178638
[08:58] <darkxst> xnox, if its so backwards why does ubuntu even use ubiquity-dm? other than that it would have been super easy if it wasnt for the missing logind stuff
[08:59] <xnox> darkxst: up to raring, we were using consolekit in ubiquity-dm so it all did work. (we recently switched to logind in the distro, and ubiquity-dm is one of the few remaining ones to switch).
[09:00] <xnox> darkxst: we use ubiquity-dm: as it uses less resources than a full-session, less confusion, and it crashes way less on slow hardware, doesn't require 3D graphics drivers, more reliable.
[09:01] <xnox> darkxst: i have tried recently, but gnome-shell was failing to load/display in Qemu, thus for example there was no way for me to install fedora 19
[09:02] <xnox> darkxst: i did experiment with running ubiquity-dm under compiz but there was a large increase of "compiz crash, installer froze" bugs.
[09:02] <darkxst> xnox, perhaps that is the same issue that stops boxes working properly on ubuntu?
[09:03] <xnox> darkxst: what is "boxes"? GNOME boxes?
[09:04] <darkxst> xnox, yes, the GNOME  VM thing
[09:04] <xnox> darkxst: Qemu & kvm works correctly here and displays all ubuntu releases / FreeBSD / Debian / Windows here.
[09:04] <xnox> under virtual-manager.
[09:11] <darkxst> xnox, anyway assuming we go the auto-login route, how to bypass ubiquity-dm?
[09:11] <xnox> darkxst: "echo manual" > /etc/init/ubiquity.override
[09:11] <darkxst> xnox, from casper?
[09:11] <xnox> darkxst: echo "manual" > /etc/init/ubiquity.override
[09:12] <xnox> darkxst: yeah, or some such.
[09:13] <xnox> darkxst: note that you get to keep both pieces, e.g. gnome-shell behaving really/slow crashing with free drivers, and proprietary drivers are not activated by default on the cd, thus dead-locking and preventing a user from installing your flavour =)
[09:13] <darkxst> xnox, is there anychance the logind thing would get fixed this cycle?
[09:13] <xnox> darkxst: yeah, it should be. I had other things piling up on me.
[09:14] <darkxst> xnox, well in that case, their experience is hardly going to get any better after installing!
[09:14] <xnox> darkxst: you can use raring image to develop ubiquity-dm under gnome-shell, cause that shouldn't have logind problems.
[09:15] <xnox> darkxst: sure it will, if they can install, they can tick install proprietary drivers on second page, and after install it will all be dandy good.
[09:16] <darkxst> xnox, that doesnt actually install proprietry graphics drivers does it?
[09:17] <xnox> darkxst: it does. ubuntu-drivers-common is run and if drivers are needed they are downloaded and installed into target installation.
[09:17] <darkxst> ok I will test my ubiquity patches with a raring image
[09:17] <darkxst> although gnome-shell doesnt have the external session modes on raring, but that shouldnt really matter too much
[09:19] <darkxst> ok don't think its ever worked for me, but then I don't do real installs that often

[10:17] <pitti> seb128: if that works, and it propagates after the next publisher run, we can do the same for glib
[10:18] <seb128> pitti, great, let me know how that goes
[10:18] <pitti> if it just resets it, we need to force it
[10:18] <pitti> and wait until Colin and JB fix it
[10:18] <seb128> we need also more people to be able to deal with those magics
[10:18] <smb> jodh, Not much. Second level nesting seems to suffer various odd problems but the many variations of os/arch do not make it easy
[10:18] <seb128> or not let jb and Colin take holidays at the same time :p
[10:19] <pitti> jodh: well, you said you do need the inner KVM and that lxc isn't enough (because of kernel crashes, etc.), right?
[10:20] <pitti> jodh: is that a new crash with a recent kernel? stuff seemed to work quite well a few weeks ago when I played with that
[10:21] <jodh> pitti: yes, we can't use lxc, but an alternative might be for autopkgtest to provide an (external) vm that the test can control. Avoiding nested kvm (or getting the kernel fixed in that regard) look like the best plans right now.
[10:22] <jodh> pitti: were you running autopkgtest on your home systems or via canonistack?
[10:22] <pitti> jodh: just at home
[10:22] <jodh> pitti: that might be relevant as with canonistack and I guess the autopkgtest jenkins setup there is atleast 1 extra kvm instance running.
[10:22] <pitti> jodh: but our production autopkgtest servers are real iron too, not on canonistack
[10:23] <pitti> jodh: if that only affects canonistack, is that a big issue?
[10:23] <Mirv> Wellark: let's wait for the rebuild, 10:00 UTC builds are already going, hud can be restarted later
[10:23] <pitti> test development can happen locally, and production tests won't be on canonistack either
[10:23] <jodh> pitti: maybe not. But I don't have the h/w at home and need to test somehow that it might work when deployed on autopkgtest
[10:24] <pitti> uh, no kvm capable hw?
[10:25] <jodh> pitti: I have that, but smb believes we should stick to an initial 64-bit environment. Thats the problem as my 64-bit h/w is not kvm capable.
[10:26] <smb> jodh, pitti It was mostly to find you some setup that allows you to test.
[10:27] <pitti> smb: why would nested kvm not work on a 32 bit host and guest?
[10:27] <smb> In theory, even with the canonistack guest being 32bit userspace, you still have a 64bit capable cpu provided
[10:27] <pitti> smb: I mean locally, not on cstack
[10:28] <pitti> "prepare-testbed i386" builds a 32 bit VM which should work just fine on 32 bit
[10:29] <smb> pitti, It should work but factually it has issues while using the 32bit version did not. But then this looses vmx which is of no use for jodh . But I did not know at that point he is trying a third level
[10:29] <pitti> you wouldn't use a third level
[10:29] <pitti> locally
[10:29] <pitti> AFAICS jodh only runs on canonistack because he doesn't have 64 bit kvm capable hw, but if he has 32 bit kvm hw that should be fine?
[10:30] <smb> pitti, The variation was which qemu command to use. qemu-system-i386 or qemu-system-x86_64. The former seemed to work from the 32bit userspace guest while the latter did not
[10:30] <pitti> jodh: does anything in your tests actually require 64 bits?
[10:31] <pitti> after all, these tests ought to work on i386 too
[10:31] <jodh> pitti: how many "levels" of kvm will the autopkgtest jenkins env have?
[10:31] <jodh> pitti: no. correct.
[10:31] <pitti> jodh: the jenkins slave is real iron, and the normal "run-adt-testbed" is the topmost VM
[10:31] <pitti> jodh: thus, your sub-vm within the upstart test is the second level
[10:32] <pitti> while it would be the third on cstack
[10:32] <jodh> pitti: ftr, I finished writing these tests a few weeks ago. But we are still attempting to find an environment that actually works where we can test the tests :)
[10:32] <pitti> jodh: I thought you can do 32 bit kvm on your machine?
[10:33] <jodh> pitti: ok. well I can retry locally with 32-bit but ftr that was also failing when running with qemu-system-x86_64.
[10:33] <pitti> jodh: maybe, but why do you want qemu-system-x86_64 in the first place?
[10:34] <jodh> pitti: yes I can, but the combinations we have tried as documented on various bugs show that although the systems *should* work, they do not.
[10:34] <jodh> pitti: However, as I say, I'll try once more locally with 'qemu' at all levels rather than the existing hard-coded autopkgtest qemu-* variant.
[10:34] <pitti> jodh: oh, do you mean because run-adt-test and prepare-testbed hardcode qemu-system-x86_64 for >= 13.04?
[10:35] <pitti> jodh: yeah, we should check the host architecture and use qemu-system-i386 if it's 32 bit
[10:35] <pitti> jodh: you can just change these locally in these scripts
[10:35] <jodh> pitti: correct
[10:36] <jodh> pitti: yes, it feels I've been changing those scripts almost hourly :)
[10:38] <pitti> seb128: hm, britney sets back the status to RUNNING, so hacking the state files doesn't work :(
[10:38] <pitti> so we'll need release team nudges for these
[10:42] <smb> pitti, The problem with the whole nested kvm is that each level can vary in the kernel(+kvm kernel module) and the qemu/kvm user-space driving it. Which makes it very hard to figure out what broke when.

[11:41] <Wellark> pete-woods, seb128: letäs try this one: https://code.launchpad.net/~indicator-applet-developers/hud/g_action_map_lookup_action/+merge/181533
[11:41] <Wellark> I'm suspecting that the builders are simply just under such heavy load that it causes the timing sensitive tests to sometimes fail
[11:43] <seb128> Wellark, the build fix finally got merged btw, but yeah, it makes sense to increase a bit the timeout I guess
[11:58] <Mirv> Wellark: hud amd64 built fine now
[12:02] <Wellark> Mirv: it has always built fine. :)

[12:23] <seb128> Riddell, did you see that your qtwebkit-source recent update fails to build on arm?
[12:25] <seb128> jamespage, hey, not sure if you noticed but samba is depwaiting on libtevent-dev ... do you plan to file a MIR for tevent?
[12:28] <xnox> doko_: javac seems to segfault during android build here. Not sure what broke, as both oracle and openjdk are segfaulting here.
[12:29] <paulliu> Hi, I got "Module 'HudClient' does not contain a module identifier directive - it cannot be protected from external registrations.
[12:29] <paulliu> Is there some packages I missed?
[12:30] <paulliu> wrong channel, sorry.
[12:30] <xnox> doko_: that's 6, openjdk 7 works fine, so i'll port our build to use that..... or like not build that one single java util.
[12:41] <jamespage> seb128, yeah - zul is going todo that

=== gusch|brb is now known as gusch
[13:35] <Laney> dobey: the same way you always go back, by dragging up the toolbar from the bottom
[13:35] <dobey> awesome. so i can't go back (running it on workstation)
[13:36] <xnox> Laney: i usually exit by fallowing "Exit" signs....
[13:36] <Laney> why not?
[13:36] <dobey> because i can't drag the toolbar up with a mouse?
[13:36] <Laney> sure you can
[13:36] <dobey> no. i can't
[13:36] <xnox> dobey: hm, i thought i could, also I thought on desktop the toolbar is always expanded.
[13:37] <dobey> oh, i can. i guess there's just no toolbar on the main screen
[13:37] <dobey> you know, because *that's* obvious
[13:37] <dobey> xnox: it's not
[13:37] <xnox> interesting.
[13:38] <dobey> also, why can't i just flick from left to right in the app, or on the header, to do that?
[13:38] <dholbach> lool, maybe my memory is failing me right now, but did you file a bug on the click permissions thing?

[16:02] <qengho> Weird. So, why would the first step in "apt-get", "Reading package lists" take y
[16:02] <qengho> oops.
[16:03] <qengho> take a really long time?  Like, previously, 30 seconds.  Now, minutes.
=== Ursinha-afk is now known as Ursinha
[16:06] <qengho> strace has long pauses between each read() of the downloaded Packages file.  ~32000 bytes per read().  Seems normal.
[16:06] <qengho> ...The size, not delay.
[16:14] <seb128> qengho, hey, how are you? are you getting somewhere with the chromium build fail on saucy?
[16:15] <ogra_> again ?
[16:15] <seb128> ogra_, yes...
[16:15] <ogra_> oh man ... do they change their whole code each micro release ?

[17:02] <w1nt3r> are there (detailed) docs somewhere on the process ubuntu uses to master their isos? (specifically how is the boot record created)
[17:05] <infinity> pitti: Erk, did you actually hack status files?  It would have been much less hassle to ask a release team member to just add test hint.
[17:40] <w1nt3r> where should I file a bug to add more crypt kmods to the live cd's initrd?
[17:41] <xnox> w1nt3r: $ ubuntu-bug cryptsetup
[17:42] <xnox> w1nt3r: although it could be ubuntu-cdimage bug, since cryptsetup has been changed to include only some crypt modules to live cd's initrd.
[17:42] <xnox> http://pad.lv/p/ubuntu-cdimage
[17:43] <w1nt3r> xnox: thanks, that was very non-intuitive
[18:55] <ScottK> sip4 and python-qt4 migration are blocked by python-qt4 autopkgtests still RUNNING after many hours. Could someone please have a look?

[19:17] <xnox> ScottK: jibel + cjwatson are away, and they kind of the two people who did "jenkins <-> britney" integration.

[21:10] <robert_ancell> tedg, you're handling indicate-bluetooth reviews right?
[21:11] <tedg> robert_ancell, Either myself or charles, yes.
[21:11] <tedg> What's up?
[21:12] <robert_ancell> tedg, just checking i'm not blocking any of the changes charles is making
[21:12] <robert_ancell> looking good though!
[21:13] <tedg> robert_ancell, No, we've assumed that you've moved on to some space ship thingy ;-)
[21:13] <robert_ancell> tedg, don't worry, we'll be crashing to earth soon enough :)
[21:13] <charles> robert_ancell: :-)
[21:14]  * tedg buys an umbrella
[21:14] <charles> robert_ancell: do you know of any way to get the battery charge level from a bluetooth device?
[21:14] <charles> bluez doesn't seem to have anything addressing it
[21:14] <tedg> charles, I thought upower had it?
[21:14] <robert_ancell> charles, no, sorry
[21:14] <charles> but I'm still getting up to speed on this
[21:15] <charles> tedg, at least when I tested, upower wasn't reporting anything on mpt's use cases
[21:15] <charles> for example it didn't tell me anything about the bluetooth headset I have connected
[21:16] <tedg> I wonder if it's a specific bluetooth profile that's required
[21:16] <charles> wrt upower, iirc there's not even an entry for them in the upower device type enum
[21:18] <tedg> charles, Hmm, perhaps it was a gnome-power thing that I'm remembering then.
[21:23] <charles> tedg, I don't think gnome-power does that but I'll recheck
[21:24] <tedg> charles, Well, I haven't played with gnome-power for probably 5 years... so trusting my memory here is probably not too wise :-)
[21:24] <tedg> charles, When I was a kid we didn't have these fancy system services you kids have today!
[21:25] <charles> tedg, I'm going to have to ask to see your driver's license, sir

[23:45] <smoser> hey...
=== freeflying_away is now known as freeflying
[23:45] <smoser> i wonder what people woudl think abou thits.
[23:45] <smoser> i like eatmydata.
[23:45] <smoser> i like using eatmydata with apt.
[23:46] <smoser> the one thing i'm concerned about is 'eatmydata apt-get install some-daemon-package'
[23:46] <smoser> because if some-daemon-package is sysvinit, afaik, it will inherit eatmydata. which is probably not what i want.
[23:47] <smoser> would there be an insertion point (maybe in 'service' or somewhere) where we could drop libeatmydata's LD_PRELOAD .
[23:47] <smoser> unless there was another environment variable EATMYDATA_SYSVINIT or something also present.
