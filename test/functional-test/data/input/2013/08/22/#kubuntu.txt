[00:23] <kAEnt> i just installed kubuntu and i can get to the login screen just fine but after i log in and the loading thingie shows up the screen goes to lines and then freezes
[00:23] <kAEnt> how can it be driver issues if i can see the login screen
[00:23] <kAEnt> the same thing happens on the live cd
[00:24] <kAEnt> when i choose "Try"
[00:24] <kAEnt> any suggestions? i dont even know where to begin on the forums or google
[00:32] <IdleOne> BluesKaj: seems my problem with kscreen was that  libkscreen0 was not being removed so it could install  libkscreen1
[00:32] <IdleOne> fixed now.

[14:24] <Guest61054> hi
[14:24] <Guest61054> how can i add picture to pastebin
[14:25] <Tm_T> Guest61054: IIRC there's services for images, imagebin perhaps?
[14:25] <Guest61054> thanks , i take a look
[14:27] <Guest61054> Thanks Tm_T
[14:27] <Guest61054> well
[14:27] <Guest61054> i have a problem that started this week
[14:28] <Guest61054> please take a look at my screenshot and help me figure out what might be the problem
[14:28] <Guest61054> http://imagebin.org/268402
[14:29] <Guest61054> problem is that the internet is running very slow on this computer
[14:29] <Guest61054> my other laptop runs fine
[14:29] <Guest61054> that picture shows that cpu 1 is running near 100 %
[14:30] <Guest61054> system monitor dont show that any program uses that much cpu
[14:30] <Guest61054> kworker takes 20 %
[14:31] <Tm_T> Guest61054: do you know which process?
[14:31] <Guest61054> and everyting else less than 10
[14:31] <Tm_T> hmmm
[14:31] <Guest61054> exactly
[14:31] <Tm_T> Guest61054: I'd introduce two commandline applications I haven't seen gui equivalents yet: htop and iotop
[14:32] <Tm_T> I'd start from iotop, with "sudo iotop -o" you get some information if something is causing io traffic that would explain the load
[14:32] <Guest61054> and what do i have to do
[14:33] <Guest61054> ok
[14:33] <BluesKaj> Guest61054, try "view " , it will show the processes
[14:34] <Guest61054> kristjan@kristjan:~$ sudo iotop -o
[14:34] <Guest61054> [sudo] password for kristjan: 
[14:34] <Guest61054> sudo: iotop: command not found
[14:34] <lordievader> Guest61054: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install iotop
[14:37] <Guest61054> ok i got that installed
[14:37] <Guest61054> now some lines blinking there but dont show mutch information
=== joerg is now known as Guest74939
[14:39] <BluesKaj> ok I'll repeat myself , Guest61054, try "view " option in system monitor  , it will show the processes that are using up cpu 
[14:45] <Guest61054> u mean process table BluesKaj ?
[14:46] <BluesKaj> Guest61054, yes , scroll to find the process and kill it 
[14:47] <Guest61054> it shows that kworker takes 20 % and everything else less than 10 %
[14:48] <BluesKaj> keep looking , it's something that's using at least 50% or more
[14:50] <Guest61054> init (root ) 27 % , sudo 25 % ,kthreadd 19 %, kworker 19 %, 
[14:51] <BluesKaj> sudo ?
[14:52] <RamchandraApte> Yes, sudo should not be taking 25% CPU.
[14:53] <BluesKaj> Guest61054, are you updating upgrading ?
[14:53] <Guest61054> just updated yes
[14:53] <Guest61054> i will restart now

[18:08] <netQT_> Hello everyone, could someone helm with this problem
[18:08] <netQT_> when I put my usb, it says the following
[18:08] <netQT_> An error occurred while accessing 'Generic USB Flash Disk', the system responded: The kernel driver for this filesystem type is not available.: Error mounting: mount: /dev/sdb: can't read superblock
[18:08] <netQT_> what does it mean? what can I do?
[18:11] <genii> What filesystem is it formatted with?
[18:12] <netQT_> you mean FAT32?
[18:12] <BluesKaj> netQT_, best to format to ntfs 
[18:12] <netQT_> but how can I do that? it doesn't open it at all
[18:13] <netQT_> it just prompts that message
[18:14] <genii> netQT_: You have files on there you need? If it's OK to format it, you can just do that instead.
[18:14] <BluesKaj> netQT_, do you have a windows install ? if so use it to format the drive
[18:15] <genii> I wonder why it's saying sdb and  not sdb1
[18:15] <BluesKaj> I'll bet the drive is brand new , same thing happened to me last week 
[18:16] <netQT_> can I format it from command line? because I can't open it
[18:21] <BluesKaj> netQT_, I managed to format my usb with partition editor in kmenu > system
[18:25] <netQT_> should I click on create new partition device??
[18:26] <genii> Yes.
[18:34] <netQT_> THANK YOOOOU!!!! SAVED MY DEVICE AND ME :)
[18:34] <BluesKaj> netQT_, good :)

[21:14] <HarrierROI> Hi ubuntu users! Has anyone tried to install unity 3D on ubuntu using wine?
[21:23] <littlegirl> Hey there, does anybody know off-hand whether Kubuntu has the /etc/resolv.conf file *and* whether that file has the nameserver line in it by default? Mine has it, but at this point I'm not sure if it was created as a result of something I did or not, and I don't have Kubuntu in a VM to check.
[21:27] <Hypnotoad> !resolvconf
[21:27] <ubottu> resolvconf is a set of scripts that's used to manage /etc/resolv.conf in 12.04 and later, for more information please see: http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/ and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.10/serverguide/network-configuration.html#name-resolution
[21:28] <littlegirl> Thanks. I'll see if that has the info I need. (:

[21:56] <Taggnostr> hello
[21:57] <Taggnostr> I have 13.04 installed and I just got a notification that says that there's a new version of kubuntu available, and since it's a bit early for 13.10 I was wondering what it is.  Is it just an update for kde?
