[00:43] <Impossible> hi
[02:18] <smartboyhw> OK, testing day for Kubuntu (after this, Xubuntu alternates and Mythbuntu)
[04:15]  * smartboyhw will come back to test Kubuntu 12.04.3 amd64 alternate
[06:04] <Noskcaj> Something broke in ktp. can someone take a look? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ktp-call-ui/0.6.3-1ubuntu1/
[06:18] <soee> good morning
[06:40] <jussi> is there a way to make apt automatically install suggested packages? or ask you about them, instead of just telling?
[06:57] <valorie> I think it's --install-recommends
[07:12] <jussi> valorie: no, that is enabled already by default. I am talking about suggested packages
[07:16] <valorie> ok
[07:35] <yofel> jussi: sure there is
[07:35] <yofel> --install-suggests
[07:35] <yofel>            Consider suggested packages as a dependency for installing. Configuration Item: APT::Install-Suggests.
[07:35] <valorie> haha, just found: http://askubuntu.com/questions/117635/how-to-install-suggested-packages-in-apt-get
[07:36] <valorie> BUT: --install-suggests installs the recommendations, and all *their* recommendations
[07:36] <valorie> could be lotsa packages
[07:37] <yofel> it will be a lot, recommends are recursive too, but it's simply not that much
[08:23] <lordievader> Good morning.

[10:47] <smartboyhw> ^ Please test the 12.04.3 images
[10:48] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: I did
[10:48] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, the alternates also?
[10:48] <shadeslayer> :S
[10:48]  * shadeslayer has never used the alternate ISO's
[10:49] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yes, they exist for amd64, sigh
[10:49] <smartboyhw> and i386
[10:49] <smartboyhw> (Actually I'm saying 12.04(
[10:49] <shadeslayer> fine
[10:49] <BluesKaj> what's the ping all about ?
[10:49] <shadeslayer> QA is boring work 
[10:49] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, 12.04.3 image testing
[10:50] <BluesKaj> not me 
[10:51] <shadeslayer> I wish we couldm automate away this stuff :<
[10:51]  * smartboyhw agrees
[10:51] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, and anyways you completed only 2 out of the 7 testcases
[10:52] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: yes, because it was boring and monotonus
[10:52] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, LOL

[10:58] <soee> the no logoin sound i can confirm
[10:58] <smartboyhw> Uh oh:(
[10:58] <BluesKaj> never noticed , always turn those sounds off , annoying to me 
[11:00] <soee> BluesKaj, true :D
[11:01] <BluesKaj> soee, did you ever get your audio issue solved ?
[11:02] <BluesKaj> just curious
[11:03] <soee> BluesKaj, the one with nvidia hdmi ?
[11:05] <BluesKaj> soee, I think so , yes
[11:06] <BluesKaj> it was a while ago...my memory isn't so great
[11:06] <soee> BluesKaj, partially, now i have only problem when Skype shows some notification than if for example playing Yutube video the voice is played like its speed would be set to x2 :)
[11:10] <BluesKaj> sorry , I don't understand
[11:16] <BluesKaj> BBL
[11:22] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, no need to do the amd64 alternate, I will do it:P
[11:23] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: already doing it
[11:23] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: I'm doing the auto partitionining one
[11:23] <shadeslayer> can you do the manual partitioning stuff?
[11:23] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, sure
[11:23] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, auto partition is another thing, you seem to be doing entire disk
[11:24] <shadeslayer> ah hmm
[11:24] <shadeslayer> yes
[11:24] <shadeslayer> well this pointless 
[11:24] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: k doing i386 then
[11:24] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, sure.
[11:36] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: does encrypted setup work for you on amd64?
[11:36] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, NO.
[11:36] <shadeslayer> because I don't think it does on i386
[11:36] <smartboyhw> Uh hum
[11:37] <shadeslayer> keeps going back to "Setup partitions" after you write changes to the disk?>
[11:37] <smartboyhw> Yes
[11:37] <shadeslayer> yeah, can you report a bug?
[11:37] <smartboyhw> Unfortunately, it seems that doesn't happen in Ubuntu alternates (they passed)
[11:37] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, why you can't?
[11:38] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: I'm running the tests on a server ontop of kvm
[11:38] <shadeslayer> and the alternate images don't detect the network
[11:38] <shadeslayer> so can't run ubuntu-bug
[11:45] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, me doesn't either
[11:45] <smartboyhw> I'm on Virtualbox
[11:45] <smartboyhw> :P
[11:45] <shadeslayer> bah :/
[11:46] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: try changing the network driver in VBox?
[11:47] <shadeslayer> and try virtio-net
[11:47] <shadeslayer> IIRC that should work
[12:18] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, do you have http://imagebin.org/268366 ?
[12:18] <shadeslayer> tesd
[12:18] <shadeslayer> *yes
[12:18] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, mark all as fail.
[12:19] <smartboyhw> I think:P
[12:19]  * smartboyhw has to ask still
[12:19] <shadeslayer> no
[12:19] <shadeslayer> you just press Yes
[12:19] <shadeslayer> and it'll work
[12:19] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, dunno, Xubuntu are all holding it off (they might not release it with that)
[12:20] <shadeslayer> oh, well, I pressed yes, and it worked I think
[12:20] <shadeslayer> yep worked
[12:20] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, it worked
[12:21] <smartboyhw> But I think I needed to further ask
[12:25] <lordievader> smartboyhw: Got the same error here with the i386 alternate (OEM)
[12:25] <smartboyhw> lordievader, as expected
[12:25] <shadeslayer> I don't think it's an error
[12:26]  * smartboyhw doesn't too..
[12:28] <shadeslayer> mh
[12:33] <jussi> Jussi,
[12:33] <jussi> The shirts are in our warehouse and going to the embroiderer.
[12:33] <jussi> ^^^ this is good :)
[12:33] <BluesKaj> embroiderey ?
[12:36] <jussi> BluesKaj: yes, for the Kubuntu logo
[12:36] <Riddell> hi
[12:36] <Riddell> how's the testing?
[12:37] <Riddell> hmm more needing done
[12:37] <smartboyhw> Riddell, we have a problem with encrpytion
[12:37] <smartboyhw> It failed ruthlessly
[12:37] <Riddell> wibble
[12:38] <Riddell> what sort of encryption?
[12:38] <Riddell> ubuntu affected?
[12:38] <smartboyhw> Riddell, LVM
[12:38] <smartboyhw> Ubuntu seemingly not affected
[12:38] <BluesKaj> jussi, ahh , fancy :)
[12:39] <Riddell> smartboyhw: alternate?
[12:39] <BluesKaj> probly don't make those kubuntu shirts in my size anyway :(
[12:39] <smartboyhw> Riddell, alternate.
[12:39] <smartboyhw> Riddell, we also have http://imagebin.org/268366 (which appears everywhere and we decided to ignore)
[12:39] <smartboyhw> Even Xubuntu:P
[12:39] <Riddell> um, that's quite nasty no?
[12:39] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yeah
[12:42] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, reporting bug
[12:42] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: cool
[12:43] <shadeslayer> I wonder if VBox can pass do fake keyboard events
[12:43] <shadeslayer> then I can basically automate all of thos :P
[12:43] <shadeslayer> *this
[12:44] <shadeslayer> and we can concentrate on more awesome stuff
[12:44] <smartboyhw> It failed! http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubuntu-edge
[12:45] <shadeslayer> not surprised I am
[12:46] <Riddell> a shame
[12:46] <Riddell> failed is relative though, they can still go to manufacturers and say it's the most successful crowd sourcing ever and there's at least x thousand people willing to pay above market price
[12:48] <Tm_T> Riddell: well I'd say the price they were asking for the phone isn't above market price
[12:48] <Tm_T> pretty much in line with flagship phone prices
[12:49] <Riddell> 10 times what my phone cost :)
[12:49] <smartboyhw> Riddell, shadeslayer I bought a new phone today:P
[12:49] <shadeslayer> cool :)
[12:49] <smartboyhw> Very new, the salesman said it just came out for less than a week:O

[12:50] <smartboyhw> Yes that.
[12:50] <shadeslayer> sounds super expensive
[12:50] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, not really, under $300 USD for sure
[12:50] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: which one?
[12:50] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, Samsung Galaxy ACE 3
[12:51] <smartboyhw> With Android 4.2.2
[12:52] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, can you confirm that bug?
[12:52] <smartboyhw> Oh you did:P
[12:52] <shadeslayer> :)
[12:53] <smartboyhw> Make sure you mark the result as failed (for encryption)
[12:53] <shadeslayer> already did
[12:53] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, good
[12:53]  * shadeslayer doesn't particularly like Samsung phones
[12:53] <smartboyhw> We are releasing the image with that, right?
[12:53] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, what do you like then?
[12:53] <smartboyhw> Samsung is the KING here;P
[12:54] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: HTC, I have a HTC One X, still works, my HTC Desire recently died after being through 2 owners over the last 32 months
[12:54] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, HTC
[12:54] <smartboyhw> I am sometimes called HTC at school
[12:55] <smartboyhw> (Howard the Coward)...
[12:55] <shadeslayer> though I can probably get the Mobo repaired and it'll work
[12:55] <shadeslayer> lol?
[12:55] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, LMAO rather
[13:00] <ScottK> Fun: http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/27327.html
[13:04] <smartboyhw> ScottK, Mir team has proposed a fix
[13:05] <ScottK> It was irresponsible to land it in the archive with a known security vulnerability like that.
[13:11] <apachelogger> uhm
[13:11] <shadeslayer> curious, but has anyone faked key events in VBox?
[13:12] <shadeslayer> there's some documentation online but that's for their SDK, nothing that be done via the command line
[13:13] <apachelogger> ScottK: can we get such a feature as well please?
[13:14] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: wah?
[13:14] <apachelogger> also stop using vbox :P
[13:14] <shadeslayer> why :(
[13:14] <apachelogger> cuz oracle
[13:14]  * shadeslayer is fine with the OSE version
[13:14] <apachelogger> yes, that takes the oracle out of it
[13:15] <shadeslayer> nope, but VBox is most certainly faster than kvm
[13:15] <shadeslayer> or qemu
[13:15] <shadeslayer> qemu takes *ages* to boot
[13:19] <apachelogger> wut?
[13:19] <apachelogger> get proper hardware then
[13:20] <shadeslayer> -.-
[13:21] <apachelogger> anyway, I still do not know what you meant
[13:27] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ScottK shadeslayer : So we are still releasing the alternates even with the encrpytion problem?
[13:28] <shadeslayer> I wouldn't
[13:29] <smartboyhw> Riddell, ScottK your call, I and shadeslayer failed the encryption ones.
[13:30] <shadeslayer> can't someone who knows d-i stuff look into it?
[13:30]  * smartboyhw doesn't
[13:33] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, am asking in #ubuntu-release if they can fix
[13:34] <smartboyhw> Eh, most of the desktop ones aren't completed.

[14:59] <xnox> shadeslayer: no, as I believe alternate cd is borked. The udebs & debs don't match the running kernel. Thus the kubuntu-meta needs an upload & alternate cd needs a respin. See merge proposals on bug 1215453

[21:09] <Quintasan> Missing development headers I guess
[21:09] <Quintasan> Actually, I should update it in Debian and request a sync
[21:10] <Quintasan> We don't have much delta from Debian, do we?
[21:11] <Riddell> Quintasan: Noskcaj was doing syncs
[21:12] <Riddell> but because debian messed up the .orig with a funny tar in git thing it was fake syncs
[21:12] <Riddell> Noskcaj: I had to fix your other one too, the files had moved between binary packages
[21:14] <Noskcaj> ok. thanks. I really need to get a computer that can run VMs well enough to test this stuff
[21:19] <Riddell> Noskcaj: you can ask me to set up ec2s (or shadeslayer I think)
[21:19] <Riddell> Noskcaj: but why not just run it locally?
[21:21] <Noskcaj> I've got a case mod i'm partway through that will have all the VMs when it's done. And because i prefer xubuntu and can (just) run the installer in a VM with it

[21:25] <Riddell> hi littlegirl 
[21:26] <littlegirl> Hey there. (:
[21:26] <littlegirl> Maybe you know the answer to the question I just posed in #kubuntu. (:
[21:28] <Riddell> littlegirl: mine just has:
[21:28] <Riddell> nameserver 127.0.0.1
[21:28] <Riddell> search lan
[21:28] <Riddell> dns is managed by resolvconf I think
[21:29] <ScottK> Actually dnsmasque
[21:29] <ScottK> Or something close to that.
[21:29] <littlegirl> Yeah, I get the impression we don't use it any more and that the nameserver info has to be in /etc/network/interfaces but I'm trying to come up with a one-line command a new user can use to find out what their nameserver is, and I know the information is in my resolv.conf, but I'm not sure if that was there when I first installed Kubuntu. (:
[21:30] <ScottK> It's a relatively recent change.
[21:30] <Riddell> route  will tell you
[21:30] <Riddell> well that'll tell you the gateway
[21:31] <Riddell> but that's also the dns server on my home setups
[21:31] <ScottK> It's dnsmasq
[21:31] <littlegirl> Mine, too. Is that as it should be?
[21:31] <littlegirl> I can just tell users to use the gateway as the nameserver, but would that be telling them the correct thing to do?

[21:32] <Riddell> if you just want a random dns server go for 8.8.8.8
[21:35] <littlegirl> I'm trying to come up with the proper way to tell users what information needs to go into /etc/network/interfaces to set up a static IP, and part of that is knowing what the bits needed by that file are. I'd like to give them solid information, so I'm not sure 8.8.8.8 would be a good idea. (:
[21:35] <littlegirl> Here's what I've got so far: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6015549/
[21:36] <Riddell> it's a pretty good dns server https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/
[21:36] <littlegirl> If the gateway can always be used in the dns-nameservers line of the /etc/network/interfaces file, then I'm almost done and can just flesh out the explanation and the steps to take. (:
[21:36] <littlegirl> Oh, it's real! LOL
[21:37] <littlegirl> Interesting! Is that recommended rather than using your internet provider's DNS server(s)?
[21:38] <Riddell> it's easier to remember :)
[21:40] <littlegirl> Heh, that's true. Well, I'll put a note in the page suggesting that people might want to try it, but I'll probably recommend that they try the gateway first. I was hoping there was a command line incantation to ferret out the internet provider's DNS server from a fresh installation of Kubuntu. (:
[21:43] <littlegirl> I wonder how many people realize how difficult it is to take a complex topic and attempt to reduce it to simple concepts to make an easy to use document that provides enough information to get the job done without overwhelming the user with too much information which is surely aavailable elsewhere.
