[08:29] <DeusDeceit> hello world
[08:30] <DeusDeceit> Is this thing working? (noob to irc)
[08:46] <esing>  I want to mount my external hdd in kde. Doing it manually with sudo mount /dev/... /mnt/ works, but using kde with dolphin to mount the device fails with the error message "Following devices can't be mounted ....". I tried to edit /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.udisks.policy <allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>  to <allow_active>yes</allow_active> , but kde still doesn't mount any devices
[09:01] <esing> Post #2 solved the issue: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2007916
[09:02] <gregor_> Hi! I got Kubuntu 13.04 and use the included KDE Telepathy package,  how to enable Psyhic Mode there? In Kopete and Pidgin it's working.      kde-telepathy-approver is installed!
[09:02] <gregor_> Psyhic Mode -> Other person starts typing
[09:05] <Dardo> what about icons in kamoso?
[09:46] <howlymowly> hi poeple..  short question: i upgraded my 13.04 kubuntu to KDE 4.11
[09:46] <howlymowly> now all my desktop effects stopped working
[09:47] <howlymowly> how do I downgrade to 4.10 again?
[09:49] <Tm_T> howlymowly: you don't
[09:49] <Tm_T> howlymowly: let's instead figure out why desktop effects doesn't work
[09:50] <howlymowly> well.. I got an ATI graphicscard 
[09:50] <howlymowly> I use firegl
[09:50] <howlymowly> it works
[09:50] <howlymowly> just the KDE desktop effects do not work :9
[09:50] <Tm_T> howlymowly: which compositing type you're using? in systemsettings -> desktop effects -> advanced tab
[09:51] <howlymowly> Tm_T: I tried every possible combination none works
[09:51] <howlymowly> originalyl I used Opengl 2.0 + raster 
[09:51] <Tm_T> be more specific please, how they do not work?
[09:53] <howlymowly> I start them and it says "Failed to activate  desktop effetcs using the given configuration settings ... settings will be reverted to their previous value. check your X configuration .... consider changing advanced options ... "
[09:57] <Tm_T> hmmm
[09:57] <Tm_T> which window decoration do you have?
[09:58] <howlymowly> I use qtcurve
[09:58] <howlymowly> let me try changing bakc to oxygen
[10:00] <howlymowly> I also jsust made an aptitude update && upgrade  so I will restart and come back in a minute or so ..
[10:05] <howlymowly> Tm_T:  nope..   sorry, does not change anything
[10:06] <howlymowly> everything is on "default" configuration now
[10:06] <howlymowly> style and decoration etc.
[10:06] <Tm_T> howlymowly: hmmm
[10:06] <howlymowly> although ... hold on
[10:06] <howlymowly> xrender seems to work now
[10:06] <howlymowly> it didn't work before 
[10:06] <howlymowly> but opengl is still not working
[10:07] <howlymowly> I also turned off all effects
[10:07] <Tm_T> howlymowly: ensure you have qdbus and pastebinit installed, then run "qdbus -qt=qt4 org.kde.kwin /KWin supportInformation
[10:07] <Tm_T>  | pastebinit"
[10:07] <Tm_T> bah, sorry for linebreak there
[10:07] <howlymowly> no problem :9
[10:10] <howlymowly> Tm_T:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/6036074/
[10:30] <BluesKaj> Hey folks
[10:33] <Tm_T> howlymowly: hohum
[10:34] <Tm_T> howlymowly: same with opengl 2?
[10:34] <howlymowly> jupp
[10:34] <howlymowly> opengl does not work at all
[10:34] <Tm_T> interesting
[10:34] <Tm_T> howlymowly: I wonder if folks at #kwin could help with that
[10:35] <howlymowly> I just asked them :)  thats why I am here they told me to downgrade to 4.10.5
[10:35] <Tm_T> who told you that?
[10:35] <howlymowly> the guys from #kde
[10:35] <howlymowly> ahh ohh
[10:35] <howlymowly> thats not kwin ^^
[10:36] <howlymowly> I'll try again in kwin :)
[10:36] <howlymowly> but thanks for your efforts, Tm_T :)
[10:36] <Tm_T> np
[10:36] <Tm_T> howlymowly: I'll read what happened on #kde too btw, downgrade isn't a fix to regression/bug

[18:13] <ovidiu-florin> hello world
[18:14] <ovidiu-florin> if I set a port forwarding from iptables and I have ufw enabled, do I also have to set up a rule in ufw to allow that port?

[23:09] <dougl> my 13.04 only connects to my iphone hotspot intermitantly (usb hotspot works perfectly) I spoke with someone more experienced suspecting it was my network manager and he suggested it might be the modules for my wifi hardware in my asus notebook (g75v) - do my modules get updated when I do a 'apt-get dist-upgrade'?
[23:12] <Jeruvy> dougl modules are part of the kernel and get upgraded when you upgrade the kernel.  You could consider building your own kernel but that is outside the support from ubuntu.  You could ask in #kernel or ##hardware to confirm.
[23:16] <dougl> Jeruvy, too much for me... I don't do kernels anymore - but the modules will get updated when the kernel does?
[23:16] <Jeruvy> dougl you'd have to follow the linux dev groups to know for sure, or check out the current builds.
[23:18] <dougl> Jeruvy, k thanks
[23:18] <Jeruvy> dougl good luck.  
[23:21] <dougl> thank you... appreciate the info and the luck...
[23:22] <dougl> Really tho... I am not gonna fight with it - I would like to let someone know for feedback reasons but I have not had time to document the issue or develop the skills to contribute.

[23:56] <Watcher|2> I have Kubuntu 12.0. After a recent round of upgrades, transparency was turned on on my desktop. It is so transparent that I can barely ready popup menus like the USB applet. How can I turn off transparency?
[23:57] <tertu> This isn't exactly a Kubuntu problem, but more of an EFI issue
[23:58] <tertu> My laptop has a seriously screwed up UEFI implementation, such that the UEFI shell will not load on it
[23:59] <tertu> How do I change the EFI boot order from inside Kubuntu?
