[02:44] <smartboyhw> Weird, the first time I can get a KDE-style login screen working is to use XMir;O
[06:39] <soee> good morning
[07:24] <cff> Does anyone know where is the CA bundle located in Kubuntu?
[07:25] <cff> i.e. CA certificates
[07:25] <cff> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt ?
[07:27] <cff> nvm, seem so
[10:12] <smartboyhw> Can anyone sort out WHAT license is this? http://paste.kde.org/p5b216e26/
[10:24] <Riddell> smartboyhw: MIT?
[10:24] <Riddell> you can refer to http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy
[10:26] <smartboyhw> Riddell, thank you:) 
[10:26] <smartboyhw> Riddell, nah, that's X11:P
[10:31] <BluesKaj> Hey folks
[11:03] <Riddell> vinay_: tariq about today?
[11:03] <Riddell> rshort: ?
[11:28] <vinay_> Riddel, he is about, though seems to be on with a few things at the moment, do you want him to get in touch?
[11:29] <Riddell> vinay_: yeah ask him when we're having this phone call
[11:29] <vinay_> will do
[11:37] <Riddell> yofel: bug 1217110 seems to be fixed, do you agree?
[11:37] <ubottu> bug 1217110 in pinentry (Ubuntu) "pinentry-qt4 crashed with SIGSEGV in QString::indexOf()" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1217110
[11:41] <Riddell> apachelogger: what's the status of bug 215383 ?
[11:41] <ubottu> bug 215383 in kde4libs (Ubuntu) "About Kubuntu information box" [Wishlist,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/215383
[11:41] <apachelogger> it's I-need-to-create-a-tar
[11:41] <vinay_> Riddel, are you going to be available this afternoon? 
[11:42] <Riddell> vinay_: sure am
[11:42] <Riddell> apachelogger: how about today? FF tomorrow
[11:42] <Riddell> apachelogger: can I help?
[11:42] <vinay_> ok, I will get Tariq to call you at some point this afternoon
[11:42] <Riddell> vinay_: lovely
[11:42] <apachelogger> Riddell: not at home right now, so I'd do it tomorrow
[11:44] <apachelogger> alternatively you could check if I already wrote a releaseme script for about-distro and get yourself a nice snapshot ;)
[11:44] <apachelogger> at any rate 1.0 release tomorrow
[11:44] <Riddell> apachelogger: you did not
[11:45] <apachelogger> http://aplg.kollide.net/tmp/about-distro.rb http://aplg.kollide.net/tmp/about-distrorc
[11:45] <apachelogger> that should do it
[11:47] <yofel> Riddell: I've been using pinentry-curses, let me try
[11:58] <Riddell> any objections to doing beta 1?
[12:05] <yofel> Riddell: so pinentry works for you again? Still crashes here, but I'll try again later after restarting my session
[12:07] <Riddell> yofel: worked after installing a new image yesterday
[12:08] <Riddell> apachelogger: missing logo, s/ubuntu/kubuntu/ and processors? http://people.ubuntu.com/~jr/tmp/foo.png
[12:08] <apachelogger> perhaps your processor be broken :P
[12:08] <apachelogger> logo and name need addition to kubuntu-settings though
[12:09] <apachelogger> Riddell: does kinfocenter manage to detect cpu information?
[12:09] <apachelogger> I guess something's fishy in agateau's fancy parsing
[12:10] <Riddell> apachelogger: um no I don't see anything about processor in kinfocenter
[12:10] <apachelogger> it definitely is somewhere
[12:13] <Riddell> apachelogger: ooh la la, it works in french
[12:13] <apachelogger> the processor? :O
[12:13] <Riddell> no, the translations work, same functionality issues
[12:14] <apachelogger> ah ^^
[12:17] <Riddell> list = Solid::Device::listFromType(Solid::DeviceInterface::Processor)
[12:17] <Riddell> that returns empty
[12:19] <apachelogger> possibly a solid problem then?
[12:19] <apachelogger> afiestas: ^ thoughts?
[12:19] <apachelogger> https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/base/about-distro/repository/revisions/master/entry/src/Module.cpp#L136
[12:20] <yofel> True, I have no processors in kinfocenter either in saucy
[12:20] <Riddell> worrying
[12:21] <apachelogger> suppose something in saucy middleware is incompatible with solid
[12:21] <Riddell> is it time to call on the party man?
[12:23] <yofel> let me check what 4.11 does in raring, for all I know it could be everything from kde to our new udev
[12:50] <Riddell> hmm, too big? http://people.ubuntu.com/~jr/tmp/about-distro.png
[12:53] <yofel> hm... unbalanced? I would've expected for the title "Informations ..." to be aligned with the logo text. This feels like a random mixture Left (top), Middle (logo) and Right(information) alignment
[12:54] <Riddell> better http://people.ubuntu.com/~jr/tmp/about-distro1.png
[12:56] <yofel> better indeed
[13:01] <yofel> kinfocenter is fine in raring, so it's just saucy that doesn't show the processors
[13:02] <BluesKaj> yofel, can live media like cd or usb be run on an EFI equipped machine ...asked in ubuntu but no answer so far
[13:02] <BluesKaj> an ubuntu live media 
[13:03] <yofel> UEFI? ours only with secure boot I  think, The ubuntu images should work with it on too as far as I know
[13:03] <yofel> *with secure boot OFF
[13:14] <Riddell> smartboyhw: any requests for New review for me?
[13:14] <smartboyhw> Riddell, well, yes, go over the ubuntu Studio ones
[13:15] <smartboyhw> It would be great:)
[13:18] <smartboyhw> BTW, why aren't you guys replying to the Beta 1 mail?
[13:19] <Riddell> smartboyhw: I did but only for him not to the list
[13:19] <smartboyhw> Riddell, heh
[13:19] <smartboyhw> :)
[13:21] <Riddell> smartboyhw: what is ubuntustudio-installer used for?
[13:21] <smartboyhw> Riddell, it's a installer used for normal Ubuntu users to install Ubuntu Studio packages
[13:21] <smartboyhw> DId you read debian/control? If you did, that's a problem you're asking
[13:23] <Riddell> smartboyhw: I don't get what it does that muon or whatever doesn't do
[13:23] <Riddell> anything else to review?
[13:23] <smartboyhw> Riddell, any package that is ubuntustudio-*
[13:24] <smartboyhw> Riddell, we want to provide an easy option
[13:24] <smartboyhw> No need for muon
[13:24] <smartboyhw> (And normally, people ignore linux-lowlatency while installing)
[13:24] <Riddell> smartboyhw: that's the only one
[13:24] <smartboyhw> Riddell, thanks:)
[14:01] <tsdgeos> yo guys
[14:01] <tsdgeos> qt 5.1.x uds session happening
[14:01] <ScottK> tsdgeos: Where?
[14:01] <tsdgeos> #ubuntu-uds-client-1
[14:04] <ScottK> tsdgeos: Thanks.
[14:05] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yofel: Um, I think ScottK is going to join a UDS session on video, so you guys said something wrong:P
[14:06] <ScottK> No, not joining on video.
[14:06] <smartboyhw> ScottK, oh?
[14:06] <smartboyhw> I thought you are installing the plugin?
[14:07] <ScottK> No, I realized I didn't have to.
[14:07] <smartboyhw> ScottK, :O 
=== ghostcube__ is now known as ghostcube
[14:39] <smartboyhw> \o/ got my 2nd package into Debian mentors
[14:39] <Riddell> awooga
[15:24] <Riddell> what should we show in muon-discover at the front?
[15:24] <Riddell> I'm adding plasma-media-center
[15:24] <shadeslayer> insanely tired -.-
[15:24] <Riddell> digikam? calligra?
[15:34]  * genii sips and ponders kamoso, skanlite, okular, ksnapshot
[15:36] <Riddell> all installed by default
[15:36] <Riddell> not much point in advertising those in a package installer
[15:37] <smartboyhw> Riddell, Chromium
[15:37] <smartboyhw> :P
[15:38] <Riddell> bah, not KDE
[15:39] <genii> Amarok?
[15:39] <smartboyhw> Riddell, well, we will run out of options
[15:39] <smartboyhw> KDE things are already included in kubuntu-desktop and we don't have anything to recommended that is KDE...
[15:40] <Tm_T> Kopete?
[15:41] <Tm_T> Konqueror?
[15:41] <Tm_T> Calligra yes if it's not installed by default
[15:41] <smartboyhw> Riddell, just can't you ask on the mailing list
[15:42] <Tm_T> smartboyhw: nooooooooooo
[15:42] <smartboyhw> Tm_T, !?
[15:42] <Riddell> flamewar waiting to happen :)
[15:42] <Tm_T> that and would leak decisions outside our cabal
[15:43] <Tm_T> (;
[15:43] <smartboyhw> OK
[15:43]  * smartboyhw doesn't have any ideas
[15:45] <Tm_T> but yeah, if you want to make quick decisions, mailing lists aren't necessary the way to go
[15:45] <smartboyhw> Riddell, if Calligra is not included in normal kubuntu-desktop, include it
[15:46] <Riddell> smartboyhw: duplicates libreoffice
[15:46] <Riddell> krita and kexi are there
[15:46] <smartboyhw> MEH
[15:46] <smartboyhw> SO DIFFICULT
[15:46] <smartboyhw> Riddell, kde-telepathy?
[15:46] <Riddell> that's in by default
[15:46] <smartboyhw> SIGH
[15:47] <Riddell> I went with http://paste.kde.org/p677e8a80/
[15:47] <Riddell> it's all changeable, even after release cos it looks for an external file
[15:47] <smartboyhw> Riddell, +!
[15:47] <smartboyhw> !+1
[15:47] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about 1
[15:49] <shadeslayer> Riddell: calibre ?
[15:49] <shadeslayer> VLC?
[15:49] <shadeslayer> ( not KDE, but Qt )
[15:49] <shadeslayer> tomahawk?
[15:50] <smartboyhw> Riddell, suggestion: Just compare what's in download.kde.org with the kubuntu-meta list
[15:50] <shadeslayer> chromium and Firefox are good options as well IMHO
[15:50] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, Firefox +1, Chromium +infinity
[15:51] <smartboyhw> (Firefox crashes often, Chromium doesn't)
[15:51]  * Riddell out
[15:51] <Riddell> anyone who wants to make a featured.json for the website is very welcome to :)
[15:52]  * shadeslayer is too tired, just ircing from my phone
[15:52]  * smartboyhw doesn't know how to do json coding
=== rdieter_work is now known as rdieter
[18:46]  * keithzg thinks promoting Tomahawk is a good idea, since it's one of the most interesting 'new' KDE programs out there; admittedly, barely ever used it since listening to music is what my phone is for...but it's definitely one that many people might like, but few would know about on their own.
[20:54] <kubotu> ::workspace-bugs:: [1204585] kwallet requires first use setup @ https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1204585 (by Jonathan Riddell)
[21:08] <valorie> just to clarify: tomahawk isn't KDE, although the devels are all kde folks
[21:09] <valorie> also: Konversation?
[21:09] <valorie> we provide Quassel, which again is not KDE
[21:34] <ScottK> The how we got there with Quassel is somewhat exceptional though.
[22:32] <valorie> ScottK: not fighting any battles
[23:02] <keithzg> Is the conception that the Muon Discover banner applications *must* be part of KDE SC, though?
[23:04] <keithzg> Admittedly, Amarok ships by default, eh? And Tomahawk duplicates that in much the same way Konversation duplicates Quassel.
[23:06] <keithzg> But IMHO in the case of Tomahawk, it's a slightly strange but really interesting application; it'd be a crazy thing to foist on people as a default (a bit too of-the-moment), but seems like exactly the thing to say "hey, you might be interested in checking this out!"
[23:19] <valorie> konversation duplicates quassel?
