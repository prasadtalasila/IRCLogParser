[01:55] <rick_> Having issues with lvpnc, I can stop it with "service lvpnc stop", How can I keep it from starting at boot?
[01:57] <rjdohnert> remove it from /etc/init.d
[01:58] <rjdohnert> If it starts with KDE disable it using the Startup and Shutdown utility in system settings
[02:03] <rick_> what is it called in the service manager? I don't see lvpnc listed
[02:16] <rick_> I gave this a try, edit  /etc/default/openvpn| changed AUTOSTART=none, I'll reboot and see if that fixes it, else /etc/init.d/lvpnc is going to the trash

[07:25] <twager> For distribution installation package names and missing apps information, run: inxi --recommends
[07:26] <valorie> and what did inxi --recommends say?
[07:28] <valorie> dragu_: so you are trying to downgrade?
[07:28] <dragu_> valorie: yes, to working version
[07:29] <twager> valorie: Told me inxi was not installed

[07:32] <valorie> it seems worthwhile to file or at least search for a bug report
[07:33] <valorie> I mean, you have the list, so you *could* go ahead, and then re-add those packages, but that seems very risky to me

[07:45] <Nilli> I'm using a Kubuntu 12.04 live USB stick now, trying to install a game into my home folder.. Dolphin says I have 2.6 GiB free (when I'm in the game's installation folder) but the game says there's not enough space. I did "cat /dev/urandom > file.txt" to see how little I had, but it kept going beyond what the game says it requires..
[07:46] <Nilli> does anyone know if I should've installed the game in a better folder somewhere, or what else could be wrong?
[07:50] <Nilli> I also did "df -h" and every line listed has enough space for this game besides "/rofs" and "/run/lock"
[07:52] <Nilli> oh, I just noticed that the amount missing is growing if I just wait between tries... at first it said it needed an additional 78 MB, then I waited and on the next try it needed an additional 80 MB... this should be a good clue, but I don't know what to do with it.
[07:55] <hateball> Nilli: well when you run live your disk is your RAM...
[07:56] <hateball> well, vice versa
[07:56] <Nilli> but things I place in my home folder stay permanently on the USB stick
[08:01] <Nilli> and even so... "free -m" shows way more than this game should ever need... >_<
[08:01] <hateball> Nilli: Yes, but that's because the stick has a partition for /home. *all* your RAM does not get allocated for the live-session, otherwise you could not run anything at all :)
[08:02] <hateball> provided the stick is large enough, you could install a permanent environment on it, but it would be terribly slow
[08:03] <Nilli> since I have permanent settings and files on it, I thought that's what I have done
[08:04] <hateball> hmmm, I see you said install game to the home folder... do you mean unpacking it from the internet or using the package manager?
[08:04] <Nilli> I believe it's a 16 GB stick but I failed when installing it so I only allocated 4 GB to it... is there a way for me to install a new Kubuntu on it from the stick itself? I don't have access to this computer's software so I can only use the hardware thanks to the stick
[08:05] <Nilli> I downloaded an install.sh from the game's website, it installed its own "launcher", and when I run the launcher I believe it attempts to download patch files. it's an mmo.
[08:06] <Nilli> I told it to install itself in ~/Games/
[08:07] <hateball> alright, then it should work I think. And no you cant install on top of your running session. If you had another stick however...
[08:09] <Nilli> ah.. so if I boot from something else, mount this as a storage device and then install on it, it could work.. but wouldn't another stick run into the same memory issue?
[08:19] <Nilli> gonna try reboot and see if that frees up enough MB just to get past this threshold.. might be back later
[08:20] <Nilli> thanks for your time hateball
[08:23] <hateball> oh s/he left

[21:25] <ronnoc> Hi all. Quick ? - Do the Phased Updates that Canonical is rolling out affect all flavors? (I'm assuming yes) http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/08/phased-updates-to-start-rolling-out-for-ubuntu-13-04
[22:41] <Pibble> Yay commandline... D:
[23:13] <Basstard`> Where do I set to show updates for either the next LTS, the next STS, or nothing at all in 12.04?
[23:14] <genii> Basstard`: /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
[23:24] <Basstard`> genii: Ah, hm, update-manager-core & -kde wasn't installed. Are they installed by default in 12.04?
[23:27] <Pibble> O.o
[23:28]  * Pibble pokes muon update manager
[23:29] <genii> Basstard`: I don't know if they are part of the base install or not, sorry.
[23:29] <Pibble> wooo 10kb worth of updates
[23:34] <Basstard`> Ah, seems Muon is the default for Kubuntu 12.04 which pulls update-manager-kde & -core whereas Apper does not.
