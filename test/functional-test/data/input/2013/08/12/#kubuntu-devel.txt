[00:08] <JontheEchidna> yofel: yeah, that got sru'd
[00:16] <smartboyhw> ScottK, I can't upgrade kopete here, there are 2 dependencies that just doesn't exist

[02:29] <ScottK> smartboyhw: What dependencies in what release?
[04:54] <jalcine> smartboyhw: is there a iCal that I can use to follow Kubuntu events?
[05:21] <shadeslayer> morning :)
[05:21] <shadeslayer> jalcine: not really
[05:22] <shadeslayer> !testers | Please help to QA bug 1208413
[05:22] <ubottu> bug 1208413 in kscreen (Ubuntu Raring) "Please update kscreen to 1.0.1" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1208413
[05:22] <ubottu> Please help to QA bug 1208413: Help is needed in #kubuntu-devel. Please ping Riddell, yofel, soee, Tm_T, shadeslayer, BluesKaj, James147, smartboyhw, Quintasan, lordievader, shrini, tester56 for information.
[05:23] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oy?
[05:23] <smartboyhw> jalcine, no
[05:23] <smartboyhw> ScottK,  kopete : Depends: libmediastreamer-base3 (>= 3.6.1) but it is not installable
[05:23] <smartboyhw>           Depends: libortp9 (>= 3.6.1) but it is not installable
[05:23] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: kscreen needs QA
[05:23] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh, in 13.10？
[05:23] <shadeslayer> 13.04
[05:23] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, bye bye:P
[05:23]  * smartboyhw does not have 13.04
[05:25]  * shadeslayer has to resist the early morning urge to open reddit and focus on work
[05:34]  * smartboyhw reboots to install Debian alongside (K)ubuntu
[05:47] <shadeslayer> yofel: fyi currently installing the hwe stack + kubuntu-backports / updates causes kwin to be removed
[05:47] <shadeslayer> and then when you go back, it screws up X11
[05:48] <shadeslayer> something about libgl1 or sth ... not sure
[06:09] <soee> good morning
[07:30] <valorie> !info inxi
[07:30] <ubottu> Package inxi does not exist in raring
[08:11] <shadeslayer> 0.o
[08:11] <shadeslayer> !info inxi saucy
[08:11] <ubottu> inxi (source: inxi): full featured system information script. In component universe, is extra. Version 1.9.12-1 (saucy), package size 115 kB, installed size 438 kB
[08:11] <shadeslayer> I see, only in saucy
[08:11] <shadeslayer> valorie: you could request a backport I suppose
[08:30] <jussi> !find inxi
[08:30] <ubottu> File inxi found in calibre, python-spyderlib, quassel-data
[08:30] <jussi> Riddell: are you about today? 
[08:59] <Riddell> jussi: sure
[09:22] <jussi> Riddell: so after investigating the tshirt/poloshirt situation a fair bit, it seems your local supplier would be the best deal. I was thinking if you buy a batch, then I will sell them, and let you know where to send each one when we have the money. The only parts we need to figure out are postage and final pricing. (as well as $design
[09:23] <jussi> )
[09:23] <jussi> say buy 25 to start off with, we put them on the sales website and see how quickly they sell. then we decide how to go forward (numbers etc) after that
[09:23] <Riddell> jussi: meh, I'm really not sure I want to spend my time packing and posting tshirts
[09:24] <jussi> ok. fair enough - your price was 12.50£ right? 
[09:24] <Riddell> yeah I think so, for the polos
[09:24] <jussi> also, are we happy with just the Kubuntu logo on the front chest? 
[09:24] <jussi> or do we want more? 
[09:24] <jussi> (affects price)
[09:24] <Riddell> "It will be £12.50 per poloshirt which will be a total of £250.00 for 20 of them."
[09:25] <Riddell> keep it simple I'd say
[09:25] <jussi> ok. White ok? 
[09:26] <jussi> (white is minorly cheaper than the others)
[09:26] <Riddell> jussi: white's ok yes
[09:26] <jussi> otherwise a navy blue is my preference
[09:26] <Riddell> but yeah I'd have naxy blue as preference too
[09:27] <jussi> Ill look around again. WHat price is acceptable asa a sales price? 19.95€ plus postage ?
[09:27] <jussi> (embroidered, not printed)
[09:30] <Riddell> jussi: what are you thinking for payment?
[09:30] <Riddell> the kubuntu paypal account or something else?
[09:30] <Riddell> cos that's in £
[09:30] <jussi> Riddell: something else
[09:32] <jussi> Riddell: I will put them here: https://holvi.com/shop/Kubuntu/
[09:33] <Riddell> great
[09:33] <Riddell> I'd go for €20, 19.95 just seems tacky :)
[09:33] <jussi> yeah
[09:46] <jussi> Riddell: Im asking for a quote still from one guyh here in .fi - friend of mine so probably will get a better deal than normal
[09:56] <Riddell> jussi: or ask my people and get them to ship over the box
[09:57] <jussi> Riddell: i suspect this guy is going to be cheaper still - lets see
=== sayakb_ is now known as sayakb
[10:59] <smartboyhw> Hello Riddell yofel 
[10:59] <smartboyhw> Oh, two hours till my application starts:O
[11:01] <Riddell> smartboyhw: you sound quite nervous! don't be we're not here to make you scared
[11:01] <smartboyhw> Riddell, :)
[11:02] <smartboyhw> Riddell, interesting we at Ubuntu Studio are about to start to publicize our T-shirt shop as well
[11:06] <Riddell> smartboyhw: oh? got any details of how that's organised?
[11:06] <jussi> apachelogger: ping
[11:07]  * smartboyhw points Riddell to ubuntustudio.spreadsheet.fr
[11:07] <smartboyhw> But, the Ubuntu Studio team doesn't earn ANY money
[11:07] <smartboyhw> So, not Kubuntu style;P
[11:13] <jussi> smartboyhw: that address doesnt resolve for me
[11:14] <smartboyhw> jussi, uh it's spreadshirt:P
[11:14] <smartboyhw> SORRY
[11:14] <jussi> hehe
[11:15] <jussi> yeah, spreadshirt were reasonably expensive last time I checked
[11:17] <jussi> smartboyhw: I nthink the thing with ours is we dont want to "make a profit" as such, but all proceeds go back into development. So when yo0u buy a shirt, you not only get a shirt, but you contribute to making sure people continue to contribute to kubuntu
[11:17] <smartboyhw> jussi, we don't even GET the money ourselves
[11:17] <smartboyhw> :P
[11:17] <jussi> yeah, studio is a bit different setup to Kubuntu
[11:18] <smartboyhw> jussi, actually the main issue is of negotiating with Canonical:P
[11:29] <Riddell> "Mackenzie Morgan (maco.m) renewed their own membership in the Kubuntu Members (kubuntu-members) team until 2014-08-13"  hoorah, maco still loves us!
[11:34] <jussi> :D
[11:36] <highvoltage> :-)
[11:44] <jussi> Riddell: so I have a quote. A once off fee of 40€ for embroidery, then 14€ per shirt for the first 25 shirts. If we order more shirts later, there is no fee for embroidery, and if we order in greater quantities the price gets cheaper. How does that sound? Good enough to go to the council and get a decision? 
[11:45] <Riddell> jussi: yeah I'd say so
[11:45]  * Riddell out for an hour

[12:59] <ScottK> Here is good
[12:59] <smartboyhw> ScottK, because I want meetingology to appear:P
[12:59] <shadeslayer> ola
[12:59] <jussi> here is good
[12:59] <jussi> heya shadeslayer
[12:59] <smartboyhw> Whoa, that's a lot of people here:)
[12:59] <ScottK> smartboyhw: We usually do these here.
[13:00] <smartboyhw> ScottK, alright
[13:00] <ScottK> We don't really need meetingology for this.
[13:00]  * ScottK looks at Riddell to lead the meeting.
[13:00] <smartboyhw> ScottK, it's :00 here now
[13:00] <ScottK> It is.
[13:01] <Riddell> good afternoon friends
[13:01] <smartboyhw> Good evening
[13:01] <Riddell> who's here for a kubuntu-dev meeting?
[13:01] <smartboyhw> o/ as the applicant
[13:01] <jussi> o/
[13:01] <shadeslayer> and the rest of us as smartboyhw's nightmare
[13:01] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, LOL
[13:01] <ScottK> \0
[13:01] <yofel> o/
[13:02] <shadeslayer> o/
[13:02]  * ScottK pokes at debfx and JontheEchidna
[13:02] <Riddell> does anyone remember the wiki page describing the process? I can't seem to find it
[13:02] <Riddell> but I think it's just a simple majority of people from https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-dev/+members
[13:02] <yofel> it should be a simple +3 AFAIR
[13:02] <smartboyhw> Riddell, https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/KubuntuDevelopers
[13:02] <shadeslayer> ^^
[13:03] <shadeslayer> I think it was a simple matter of cookies
[13:03] <smartboyhw> Well, majority of attendees, and the attendess >= 3

[13:03] <smartboyhw> For a nice and fresh topic:)
[13:04] <Riddell> smartboyhw: do you have a wiki page?
[13:04] <smartboyhw> Riddell, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/smartboyhw
[13:04] <smartboyhw> (Wasn't really detailed with packages worked on)
[13:04] <smartboyhw> The one with packages detail should be @ https://wiki.ubuntu.com/smartboyhw/KubuntuDevApplication
[13:05] <Riddell> but it's not?
[13:05] <smartboyhw> Or /KubuntuDeveloperApplication
[13:05] <Riddell> ah yes https://wiki.ubuntu.com/smartboyhw/KubuntuDeveloperApplication
[13:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, that's the list of packages at least
[13:06] <Riddell> smartboyhw: excellent, so now we get to test you a bit on your packaging knowledge
[13:06] <smartboyhw> Great:)
[13:07] <Riddell> smartboyhw: I'm an archive admin, what do you think I look at when reviewing a package that has been uploaded
[13:08] <smartboyhw> Riddell, has been uploaded? 
[13:08] <smartboyhw> Lintian warnings
[13:08] <smartboyhw> Whether it's NEW
[13:08] <Riddell> smartboyhw: uploaded to New yes
[13:08] <smartboyhw> Is it installable
[13:08] <smartboyhw> Build-dep
[13:08] <smartboyhw> Changelog
[13:08] <smartboyhw> Symbols
[13:08] <smartboyhw> Copyright
[13:09] <smartboyhw> dh version (shouldn't be too low)
[13:10] <smartboyhw> .install files
[13:10] <smartboyhw> (Shouldn't have duplicates or not-installed files unless necessary or included in another package)
[13:10] <Riddell> yep all that.  copyright is an important one for archive admins, do you know what we'll be looking for there?
[13:10] <Riddell> (in New reviews)
[13:11] <smartboyhw> Riddell, the copyright should be correct for each file
[13:11] <smartboyhw> With the correct License
[13:12] <Riddell> yeah licences is an important thing we'd check
[13:12] <Riddell> suspicious-source checks for any PDF files, do you know why they might be a problem?
[13:12] <Riddell> we also use that during New reviews
[13:13] <smartboyhw> Riddell, because of 1. license issues 2. proprietary or non-free features needed
[13:13] <Riddell> if it was under the GPL why might it still be a problem?
[13:14] <Riddell> others: nudge you can question too
[13:14] <smartboyhw> It is a generated file
[13:14]  * shadeslayer is waiting for Riddell to finish :)
[13:14] <smartboyhw> It should be generated at compile-time instead?
[13:15] <Riddell> smartboyhw: lovely
[13:15] <Riddell> not necessarily generated at compile time but the source does need to be there as it's not perferred modifiable form
[13:15] <Riddell> shadeslayer: go ahead
[13:16] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: we have a bunch of fields in the control file, one of them is X-Debian-ABI, why do you think we have that?
[13:16] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, because the package has a ABI version bump
[13:16] <shadeslayer> so why not just bump the so version?
[13:16] <Riddell> who from?
[13:17] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, bumping so version can cause the whole library to change
[13:18] <Riddell> smartboyhw: if you're packaging a new version of a library and you notice changed symbols what should you do?
[13:18] <smartboyhw> And bumping So version means a new thing
[13:19] <smartboyhw> Riddell, pkgkde-symbolshelper patch:P
[13:19] <smartboyhw> Actually not
[13:19] <smartboyhw> Regenerate the whole symbols file is better
[13:19] <Riddell> smartboyhw: just that? what's the point of symbols files?
[13:19] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: okay, another question, what's the structure of an actual deb?
[13:19] <smartboyhw> Riddell, shared libraries
[13:20] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, it will contain like this
[13:20] <smartboyhw> /usr/lib for the libraries
[13:20] <yofel> on that topic: what is a deb file actually?
[13:20] <smartboyhw> usr/share for the icons, etc.
[13:20] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: actually, I think yofel phrased my question a bit better :)
[13:21] <yofel> (from a technical POV)
[13:21] <smartboyhw> yofel, shadeslayer it's a Debian software package format used on Debian-based systems, which works with dpkg, apt-get or aptitude
[13:21] <smartboyhw> Normally, it is tar archives
[13:21] <yofel> that is true, but what's the actual file structure?
[13:21] <shadeslayer> ^^
[13:22] <ScottK> Actually it's ar, not tar on the outside.
[13:22] <shadeslayer> ssshhhh :P
[13:22] <smartboyhw> ScottK, my fault, I did want to type ar:P
[13:22] <smartboyhw> yofel, a control.tar.gz, consisting of the meta-info
[13:23] <smartboyhw> And a data.tar.gz (or any ar file),
[13:23] <smartboyhw> consisting of the usr/lib, usr/share, usr/bin...
[13:24] <yofel> noting that ar isn't tar, ok
[13:24] <smartboyhw> yofel, ar != tar
[13:24] <smartboyhw> Got it
[13:24]  * shadeslayer is satisfied with that as well
[13:24]  * smartboyhw likes tar：P
[13:24] <smartboyhw> More questions plz:P
[13:24] <yofel> one other thing about X-Debian-ABI, what's required for it to be used?
[13:24] <shadeslayer> ^^ I did ask that, didn't get a proper reply :P
[13:25] <smartboyhw> yofel, shadeslayer when a new version of library breaks the previous one
[13:26] <smartboyhw> Actually, the previous good oneP
[13:26] <smartboyhw> :P
[13:26] <yofel> that's *when* it is used, but it doesn't just work out of the box
[13:26] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: a test is failing in a package and it really needs to be uploaded, what would you do to fix the package?
[13:26] <smartboyhw> yofel, breaks/conflicts?
[13:26]  * apachelogger sits in
[13:27] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, is the test very important?
[13:27] <smartboyhw> i.e. the whole package is NOT working?
[13:27] <yofel> smartboyhw: no, I guess you never noticed. Look at kde-workspace/debian/patches/enable_debianabimanager.diff for example
[13:27] <apachelogger> :O
[13:27]  * apachelogger leaves again
[13:27] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, ?
[13:27] <debfx> smartboyhw: how do you need to change the packages when upstream moves a file from one package/orig tarball to another?
[13:27] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: nope
[13:27] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: not so fast :>
[13:28] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, Upload it first,
[13:28] <smartboyhw> Then patch the test
[13:28] <smartboyhw> Upload a new version with new -ubuntu version?
[13:28] <smartboyhw> debfx, you mean, from .bz2 -> .xz or?
[13:28] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: sure, but how would you disable the tests
[13:29] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, override it in debian/rules
[13:29] <shadeslayer> right, *how*?
[13:29] <smartboyhw> override_dh_auto_configure:
[13:30] <debfx> smartboyhw: no, for example a file is moved from kopete to kde-runtime
[13:30] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[13:30] <smartboyhw> debfx, ah
[13:30] <apachelogger> why would you deactivate all tests if one test is failing?
[13:30] <smartboyhw> debfx, delete the file in kopete.install, add it in kde-runtime, make sure kde-runtime breaks the previous kopete versions and upload
[13:30] <smartboyhw> breaks/conflicts sorry
[13:31] <debfx> smartboyhw: which one? breaks and conflicts?
[13:31] <smartboyhw> debfx, and:P
[13:31]  * smartboyhw likes using “/” for "and"...
[13:32] <debfx> smartboyhw: what's the difference between breaks and conflicts? :)
[13:33] <smartboyhw> debfx, breaks means the installing package will not be configured unless the previous one is uninstalled
[13:33] <smartboyhw> Conflicts means the two packages will not be configured and unpacked at same time
[13:34] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, hmm, then maybe patch the package itself so the scripts running the tests will not run the failed one?
[13:34] <ScottK> smartboyhw: Take a look at http://paste.debian.net/24321/ and tell me what your reaction to that being in a source package would be?
[13:34] <apachelogger> (technically the breaker will not even be unpacked)
[13:34] <shadeslayer> o_o
[13:34] <apachelogger> (technically conflicts means they will not ever be unpacked at the same time)
[13:35] <smartboyhw> ScottK, the formatting is a bit weird
[13:35] <shadeslayer> I think that is intentional :P
[13:35] <smartboyhw> Fix it?
[13:35] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: that would seem more reasonable
[13:35] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, OK
[13:37] <ScottK> smartboyhw: That's called minified javascript.  It's a problem because it's not the preferred form of modification, so it can't be considered source.
[13:37] <smartboyhw> ScottK, sorry, I touched C, C++ and Python before, but never js
[13:37] <ScottK> So you can't just copy it into the binary for Main/Universe.
[13:37] <ScottK> You'll find it often in documentation.
[13:38] <Riddell> smartboyhw: do you know the current best practice for packaging python?
[13:38] <yofel> smartboyhw: symbol files have the version when the symbol was added attached to every symbol (e.g. '_ZN4KWin12glBindBufferE@ABI_1_2 4:4.10.80'). What is it used for? And where does ABI_1_2 come from?
[13:38] <Riddell> which debhelper module?
[13:38] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yofel one question at a time...
[13:38] <smartboyhw> Riddell, dh_python ？
[13:38] <debfx> smartboyhw: would it be enough to just use Breaks?
[13:38] <shadeslayer> okay, too many questions, I think I'll hold off on mine for now 
[13:39] <yofel> smartboyhw: just answer them in the order they're asked
[13:39] <smartboyhw> yofel: It means the minimum version that the symbols exist. ABI_1_2 come from the SOVERSION
[13:39] <smartboyhw> And maybe the ABI version?
[13:39] <smartboyhw> debfx, no
[13:39]  * apachelogger thinks yofel likes ABI a lot :P
[13:39] <yofel> smartboyhw: where is that minimum version used?
[13:40]  * yofel wonders how apachelogger realized that yofel is evil
[13:40] <smartboyhw> debfx, breaks can't ensure what happens when the two packages are unpacked AT THE SAME TIME
[13:40] <smartboyhw> i.e. when upgrading both packages
[13:40] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: I have a line like this in debian/rules : -dh_foo : <more lines afterwards> : what does the - there indicate?
[13:41] <debfx> smartboyhw: yes. is there a better alternative to Conflicts in this case?
[13:41] <apachelogger> yofel: should you ever run out of evil ask me for questions.txt it shall give you plenty more evil :P
[13:41] <yofel> smartboyhw: almost correct, ABI_ comes from debian abi manager, usually it says 'Base' there. 1 is the SOVERSION, 2 is X-Debian-ABI
[13:41] <yofel> apachelogger: :O
[13:41]  * shadeslayer would like to see apachelogger's questions.txt
[13:41] <smartboyhw> debfx, I thought Conflicts are mostly replaced by breaks now...
[13:42] <Riddell> smartboyhw: dh_python isn't current best practice but I did have to look that up to double check, how would you look it up to find out?
[13:42] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: you were likely happy enough to see questions from it
[13:42] <shadeslayer> Probably, but can't hurt to see more ;)
[13:43] <smartboyhw> Riddell, in the Debian guides?
[13:43] <smartboyhw> Riddell, and it should be dh_python2 I think..
[13:43] <Riddell> smartboyhw: yep, good answers :)
[13:43] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: what are udeb files? do we use them? why & whatfor?
[13:44] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, udeb is a micro-deb that does not have the requirements for changelog, copyright, etc.
[13:45] <debfx> smartboyhw: right, but you said correctly that breaks isn't enough. instead of Conflicts you should use Breaks+Replaces for moving files between packages.
[13:45] <smartboyhw> I don't think the Kubuntu team uses it, you will normally use it for kernels (like in d-i)
[13:45] <smartboyhw> debfx, yep:)
[13:45]  * smartboyhw really doesn't know the answer to shadeslayer's -dh question, uh oh:P
[13:45] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: what's etc? do we use udebs? whatfor do we use udebs?
[13:45] <shadeslayer> :>
[13:46] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, even md5sums
[13:46] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: so basically - is used to indicate that even if dh_foo fails, the package build should not fail
[13:46] <shadeslayer> and the buildd can safely ignore that error
[13:47] <Riddell> smartboyhw: for the -dh question you can say what format the debian/rules file is in and how you'd research that format to find out the syntax
[13:47] <shadeslayer> ^^
[13:47] <apachelogger> it's the obvious answer to every code question ^^
[13:47] <shadeslayer> I still have to read manual for said format :P
[13:48]  * shadeslayer hides from apachelogger
[13:48]  * yofel notes that smartboyhw hasn't answered what those minimum versions are used for either - actually tell 2 dpkg-/dh_ parts that use that information
[13:48] <yofel> s/parts/commands
[13:49] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: what's a virtual package?
[13:50] <smartboyhw> Riddell, debian/rules is in a makefile
[13:50] <apachelogger> oh
[13:50] <smartboyhw> Riddell, because most debian/rules has a #!/usr/bin/make -f header:P
[13:50] <apachelogger> I found a god one
[13:50] <apachelogger> or a good one, lololo
[13:50] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, ?
[13:51] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: you still have not answered whether we use udeb files and what we use them for if we use them?
[13:51] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: there are a bunch of unanswered questions 
[13:51] <apachelogger> then you get the singlest most evil question in the world ^^
[13:51] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, if you use them you use it only for kernels or partman right?
[13:52] <apachelogger> kinda, there's a reason for that though
[13:52] <smartboyhw> Or for packages that has requirements such that it shouldn't contain so many different iinfo...........
[13:52] <smartboyhw> Since these packages can only be done in RAm
[13:52] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, virtual package
[13:52] <smartboyhw> It normally is used to contain specific packages
[13:52] <smartboyhw> For example, calligra depends on different calligra components
[13:53] <shadeslayer> uhm I think you're confusing virtual packages with meta packages :)
[13:53] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oops:P
[13:54] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, it's used for provides
[13:54] <smartboyhw> When one package provides a functionality
[13:54] <ScottK> What's wrong with "Depends: default-mail-transport-agent"
[13:55] <smartboyhw> ScottK, then it doesn't know which mail transport agent to install
[13:55] <smartboyhw> Since there are many packages providing it
[13:55] <ScottK> Sure it does.  default-mail-transport-agent is only provided by one package.
[13:55] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: how would you get details of a virtual package from the command line
[13:56] <shadeslayer> i.e equivalent of apt-cache show for virtual packages
[13:56] <Riddell> folks: time to start wrapping up, no new questions please
[13:56] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, what details do you want?
[13:56] <ScottK> smartboyhw: A package should almost always have an alternate to a virtual depends, like mail-transport-agent | postfix
[13:57] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: what packages provide that virtual package
[13:57] <Riddell> shadeslayer: ahem
[13:57] <smartboyhw> apt-cache showpkg?
[13:58] <shadeslayer> cool, I'm done :)
[13:58] <smartboyhw> ScottK, oh
[13:58] <ScottK> That's if there are multiple providers of the virtual package.  Actually my first example was fine.
[13:58] <smartboyhw> Thank you all for grilling me:)
[13:59] <smartboyhw> ScottK, uh .....
[13:59] <Riddell> smartboyhw: we've been chatting a bit in a private channel (I know, very naughty of us)
[13:59] <smartboyhw> Riddell, private channel?!
[13:59]  * smartboyhw does not understand
[13:59] <smartboyhw> Oh, got it
[13:59] <smartboyhw> Very naughty
[13:59] <smartboyhw> :P
[13:59] <ScottK> There's only one default-mail-transport-agent, but multiple providers of mail-transport-agent, so the latter needs the alternate depends.
[14:00] <smartboyhw> ScottK, ah
[14:00] <Riddell> smartboyhw: we're all very happy you put yourself through the grilling and want to you to be in kubuntu-dev but are a bit concerned at the lack of detailed knowledge in areas
[14:00] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I remembered
[14:00] <smartboyhw> When shadeslayer had his grilling
[14:01] <Riddell> smartboyhw: could we ask you to do some informal training sessions with kubuntu-devs to brush up and come back next month?
[14:01] <smartboyhw> People said: "He still needs to learn a lot more"
[14:01] <smartboyhw> Then why can't I?:P
[14:01] <smartboyhw> People learn through experience
[14:01] <smartboyhw> I mean, I will still get to you guys when I have questions
[14:01] <smartboyhw> And I normally will want to get some person reviewing before uploading
[14:02] <smartboyhw> Riddell, uh informal?
[14:02] <apachelogger> I still want to ask my evil question :(
[14:02] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, you can still asK:P
[14:02] <apachelogger> nah then I can't use it next time :P
[14:02] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: you also did not ask your customary "Everyone is sloshed except you before release day"
[14:03] <apachelogger> I know
[14:03] <apachelogger> <- has 5 more questions queued :P
[14:03] <apachelogger> but oh well
[14:03] <shadeslayer> heh
[14:03] <yofel> smartboyhw: well, then not having upload permissions for a month more won't hurt much, will it? You've learned a lot lately, but I think you need to be a bit more competence until we're happy to let you upload packages unreviewed
[14:03] <Riddell> smartboyhw: or come back earlier than next month but I'd be reluctant to give you upload access if you don't know what symbols files are for etc
[14:03] <yofel> s/to be//
[14:03] <kubotu> yofel meant: "smartboyhw: well, then not having upload permissions for a month more won't hurt much, will it? You've learned a lot lately, but I think you need  a bit more competence until we're happy to let you upload packages unreviewed"
[14:05] <Riddell> smartboyhw: but don't let this put you off! we need you for 4.11 this week!
[14:05] <shadeslayer> from me, you just need a bit more experience before I give a full +1, please do reapply soonish :)
[14:05] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yofel next month sure:)
[14:05] <apachelogger> PSA: for general training everyone try to write the tiniest possible debian/rules that does not use dh (i.e. debhelper <=6)
[14:05] <ScottK> apachelogger: How about one that doesn't use debhelper at all?
[14:06] <apachelogger> also possible
[14:06] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, everyone? Including Riddell and yofel and shadeslayer ?
[14:06] <apachelogger> albeit more codes 
[14:06] <smartboyhw> :I
[14:06] <ScottK> There may still be a package or two in the archive that doesn't use it.
[14:07] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: sure
[14:07] <Riddell> hello doesn't use debhelper I think
[14:07] <yofel> would be fun, I haven't looked at all the targets in a while
[14:07] <apachelogger> I do always find it questionable when people don't know what is going on underneath dh
[14:07] <smartboyhw> No dh, uh oh:P
[14:07]  * shadeslayer recalls some targets, but not all of them
[14:07] <apachelogger> and what would be needed to create a bare minimum deb
[14:08] <apachelogger> anyway
[14:08] <Riddell> ah, classic http://starsky.19inch.net/~jr/tmp/rules
[14:08] <apachelogger> mine's 29 lines with comments and all
[14:08] <shadeslayer> o_o
[14:08] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, oh, all the targets?
[14:08] <apachelogger> the targets that are necessary :P
[14:08] <smartboyhw> I thought I was in pre-jurrasic era:P
[14:08] <apachelogger> Riddell: for some reason google's dns never wants to resolve 19inch.net
[14:08] <apachelogger> it's le weird
[14:09] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, heh
[14:09] <Riddell> apachelogger: google's dns?
[14:09] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: stop using the silly dns resolver
[14:09] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: use http://www.opennicproject.org/ instead
[14:09] <apachelogger> https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/
[14:09] <shadeslayer> so happpy :D
[14:09] <apachelogger> Are you looking for an alternative DNS provider that is open and democratic, are you concerned about censorship?
[14:10] <shadeslayer> pn5 is completely built for raring and saucy now
[14:10] <apachelogger> that doesn't even make sense
[14:10] <Riddell> dig @8.8.8.8 starsky.19inch.net  works
[14:10] <apachelogger> oh true
[14:10] <apachelogger> this machine doesn't have it hardcoded
[14:11] <apachelogger> it's the ISP's DNS
[14:11]  * apachelogger sighs at austria
[14:12] <apachelogger> mhh
[14:12] <yofel> smartboyhw: for the record, about my symbol version question. I would've been happy with dpkg-gensymbols (which sets those versions) and dpkg-shlibdeps (which calculates versioned library dependency versions from that)
[14:12] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: I like that write-a-rules thing so much if I were you I'd practise writing rules :P
[14:13] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, the only target I can't understand is binary-indep
[14:13] <smartboyhw> yofel, I know about dpkg-gensymbols (the one throwing off the symbols diff if it's wrong)
[14:13] <apachelogger> arch: all = binary-indep
[14:13] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, ah
[14:14] <shadeslayer> okay cya later
[14:14] <apachelogger> or rather, if you invoke dpkg-buildpackage with whatever silly flag there is to only build arch: all packages it will invoke binary-indep rather than binary or binary-arch
[14:14] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, got it
[14:14] <smartboyhw> So, what types of "informal" sessions have you planned for me? Give me a schedule at least...
[14:15] <smartboyhw> s/you/you guys/
[14:15] <kubotu> smartboyhw meant: "So, what types of "informal" sessions have you guys planned for me? Give me a schedule at least..."
[14:15]  * apachelogger thinks Riddell meant like you asking a random dev "can you plz tell me everything you know about udebs" (or symbols, or whatever)
[14:15] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, random dev?
[14:16] <apachelogger> observe
[14:16]  * smartboyhw picks random dev as apachelogger 
[14:16] <smartboyhw> :
[14:16] <smartboyhw> :P
[14:16] <apachelogger> yofel_: do you have time to tell me all you know about being evil WRT ABI?
=== apachelogger is now known as yovel_
[14:16] <yovel_> sure
=== yovel_ is now known as apachelogger
[14:16] <apachelogger> cool, I'll pm
[14:16] <yofel> . . .
[14:16] <smartboyhw> ...
[14:17] <apachelogger> ^ there, I did my training deed and tought smartboyhw how to request training :P
[14:17] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, what the..
[14:17] <yofel> how nice of you ^^
[14:17] <smartboyhw> How "nice" of you:P
[14:17] <smartboyhw> apachelogger, so, do you have time telling me all you know about the evil udebs?
[14:18] <apachelogger> unfortunately no, I am not at home... I hear yofel_ has time to tell you about symbols and what not ^^
[14:18] <Quintasan> oh damn it
[14:18] <Quintasan> dem time zones
[14:18] <Quintasan> I lost my opporunity to grill smartboyhw, didn't I?
[14:18] <apachelogger> Quintasan: you had been late regardless
[14:19] <yofel> well, which reminds me I need to read up on udebs myself. I usually care about them enough to know that they're stripped-down debs used by d-i
[14:19] <Quintasan> apachelogger: late for what apart from smartboyhw grilling?
[14:20] <yofel> Quintasan: you'll get another chance in a month
[14:20] <smartboyhw> yofel, anytime to talk about symbls then？
[14:20] <smartboyhw> A month is a weird restriction (LOL)
[14:20] <Quintasan> yofel, smartboyhw you might to want to keep it public
[14:21] <apachelogger> smartboyhw: actually about udeb... they indeed lack the metadata that you'd find in a regular deb reason being that they are meant for bootstrap and you don't raelly need metadata for bootstrapping,which is also why only core packages have udebs to begin with
[14:21] <Quintasan> I could use a refresh too
[14:21] <apachelogger> Quintasan: you are late to me offering free booze
[14:21] <Quintasan> apachelogger: Come to Poland.
[14:22] <Quintasan> kubotu: order beer for apachelogger
[14:22]  * kubotu gives apachelogger a nice frosty mug of beer.
[14:22] <apachelogger> let's meet in cz, they got better beer anyway
[14:24]  * smartboyhw waits for yofel to start
[14:25] <smartboyhw> Actually, it's good you give me another month, I need to work on linux-rt:P
[14:25] <yofel> I'm a bit busy now really
[14:27] <yofel> what I asked today is essentially documented in the dpkg-gensymbols and dpkg-shlibdeps manpages. 
[14:27] <yofel> which reminds me that we didn't ask what an shlibs file is for
[14:28] <Quintasan> did we get the symbols file :P
[14:28] <Quintasan> symbols file question*
[14:29] <apachelogger> kubotu: hi
[14:29] <kubotu> re, apachelogger
[14:29] <yofel> Quintasan: as I knew that he knows that we use them for ABI management, we only asked about debian abi manager and symbol versioning
[14:29] <apachelogger> kubotu_: hi
[14:29] <kubotu> howdy, apachelogger
[14:29] <kubotu_> 'afternoon, apachelogger :)
[14:29] <Quintasan> yofel: I see.
[14:30] <apachelogger> kubotu_: nick kubotu
=== kubotu_ is now known as kubotu
[14:30] <apachelogger> jussi: ^ migration complete
[14:31] <smartboyhw> You guys should make a full doc on "what should a new Kubuntu packager learn"...
[14:31]  * smartboyhw looks at dpkg-gensymbols and dpkg-shlibdeps manpages
[14:32] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, then can you run me a tutorial:P
[14:34] <smartboyhw> Or just any dev/
[14:34] <Quintasan> I mean, read the damn docs
[14:35] <Quintasan> After that you should generally ask questions
[14:35] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, OK
[14:35] <Quintasan> if there is something not clear
[14:35] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, what is a substvars?
[14:36] <smartboyhw> Ah, I got it now:P
[14:36] <Quintasan> Did you actually finish reading?
[14:37] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, maybe I should ask: Where is shlibs files generated?
[14:37]  * smartboyhw can't seem to find it in the manpages
[14:38] <Quintasan> IIRC they are generated in debian/ during the build process
[14:38] <Quintasan> by dpkg-genshlibs or sth like that
[14:38] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, no that command I think
[14:38] <yofel> dpkg-shlibdeps you mean
[14:39] <Quintasan> ah yes
[14:39] <Quintasan> yofel++
[14:39] <smartboyhw> yofel, wait, does dpkg-shlibdeps generate the shlibs files?
[14:39] <smartboyhw> I can't seem to understand that part
[14:39]  * smartboyhw understands the symbols

[14:40] <yofel> dpkg-shlibdeps does generate some during build

[14:40] <apachelogger> http://man.he.net/man1/dpkg-shlibdeps
[14:40] <smartboyhw> yofel, apachelogger oh so dpkg-shlibdeps generate shlibs itself, I read the manpage and thought “Where does it come from?":P
[14:42] <apachelogger> then you didn't read the manpage :P
[14:42] <apachelogger> a
[14:42] <apachelogger> cause I just pasted from the manpage :P
[14:45] <manchicken> apachelogger: Can you RTFM me to a document showing me how to run those code quality tools you were using?
[14:45] <apachelogger> http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Code_Checking
[14:45] <manchicken> I'm dealing with interview prep right now, so I can't do anything on that project at the moment, but I want to be able to verify my code using the same tools you did prior to submitting again :)
[14:46] <apachelogger> http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/
[14:49] <manchicken> The krazy checker gives me all sorts of fun trouble.
[14:49] <apachelogger> oh?
[14:50] <apachelogger> well, it's perl software it's meant to do that ^^
[14:50] <Riddell> hmm, with 4.11 from ninjas I can't install kopete
[14:51] <yofel> installs fine here
[14:51] <manchicken> apachelogger: Ooh, touchet.
[14:51]  * Quintasan checks
[14:51] <manchicken> (touché even?)
[14:52] <Riddell> yofel: do you have libmediastreamer-base3 ?
[14:52] <apachelogger> manchicken: latter
[14:53] <yofel> yes, but that's from saucy-proposed, so that explains it
[14:53] <yofel> (I have -proposed enabled with a 50 pin)
[14:53] <smartboyhw> Riddell, me too
[14:53] <Riddell> yofel: but how does kopete build against it?
[14:53] <smartboyhw> yofel, boo
[14:53]  * smartboyhw doesn't have -propoesd here
[14:53] <Riddell> does ninjas build against -proposed
[14:54] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yes
[14:54] <smartboyhw> (sigh)
[14:54] <yofel> ninjas builds against -proposed, yes
[14:54] <Riddell> that's a good thing, just not great when we have a stuck package like this
[14:55] <Riddell> linphone Valid candidate 
[14:55] <Quintasan> That said copying packages from ppa to main won't do, will it?
[14:55] <Quintasan> to repositories*
[14:56] <yofel> well, afaik it's possible, we just never do it
[14:56] <Riddell> nope
[14:56] <Riddell> I don't think we want to do it, too error prone
[14:56] <Riddell> http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_output.txt  says something about sipwitch
[14:56] <Quintasan> hmm
[14:57] <smartboyhw> Hmm
[15:01] <ScottK> Riddell: I'm working on it.
[15:02] <yofel> tsdgeos: are we getting nepomuk-core respins? or should we just patch vishesh's fixes in?
[15:02] <vHanda> you are
[15:03] <vHanda> please wait a little while longer
[15:03] <Riddell> ScottK: linphone has always been a mess, this is probably why we dropped its use by kopete in the first place
[15:03] <vHanda> still testing some stuff
[15:03] <Riddell> ScottK: I recently added that back on request of upstream but we can remove it again if it's a problem
[15:03] <ScottK> Riddell: There's a whole dependency mess around it.
[15:03] <ScottK> No, you can leave it.
[15:06] <smartboyhw> yofel, Riddell see your inbox
[15:06] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, ^
[15:10] <apol_> is kde 4.11rc2 available yet? 
[15:10] <apol_> I don't see it here http://community.kde.org/KDE_SC/Binary_Packages
[15:10] <smartboyhw> apol_, um, we are working on 4.11.0:)
[15:11] <apol_> oh :(
[15:11] <apol_> ok
[15:11] <smartboyhw> apol_, which series are u using?
[15:11] <smartboyhw> 13.10 and 13.04 and 12.04 are available
[15:11] <apol_> I use archlinux, it was for a blogger who wanted to do some testing of 4.11
[15:11] <smartboyhw> apol_, which release is he using?
[15:12] <apol_> 13.04 i guess
[15:12] <smartboyhw> apol_, it's available in kubuntu-ppa/beta
[15:12] <smartboyhw> Tell him to sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/beta
[15:12] <smartboyhw> And sudo apt-get update
[15:12] <smartboyhw> And sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[15:12] <apol_> sure
[15:12] <apol_> smartboyhw: so you do have packages of the rc afterall?
[15:13] <yofel> yes, the binary packages page just wasn't updated
[15:13] <apol_> ok, thanks yofel
[15:19] <smartboyhw> yofel, Riddell shadeslayer do reply to the e-mail if you want me experienced enough to be dev:P
[15:19] <smartboyhw> Good night (need to sleep early, piano exam tmr)
[15:22] <Riddell> hmm kamoso gets removed when I install kde-full
[15:29] <Riddell> is it time to run kubuntu-batch-backport ?
[15:30] <yofel> well, you'll have to update nepomuk later
[15:30] <yofel> otherwise go ahead
[15:32]  * Riddell moves unstable backport hooks to stable and runs >./kubuntu-batch-backport -v 4.11.0 -f saucy -t raring -V 4.11.0
[15:43] <yofel> Riddell: -V should be 13.04
[15:46] <Riddell> yofel: doh
[15:48] <ScottK> If you rebuild kopete now, the result should be installable.
[15:49] <Riddell> ScottK: what's changed?
[15:49] <ScottK> Removed a bunch of crap from -proposed that wasn't going to get sorted otherwise.
[15:49] <ScottK> remove-package -s saucy-proposed -m "Unbuildable set of entangled packages with ucommon - See Debian #716855" ucommon libccrtp libzrtpcpp sipwitch libexosip2 libosip2 linphone siproxd
[15:49] <ubottu> Debian bug 716855 in libucommon-dev "libucomon-dev: Dependency on libgnutls28-dev makes sflphone unbuildable" [Important,Open] http://bugs.debian.org/716855
[15:50] <Riddell> lovely, thanks ScottK 
[15:50] <ScottK> So now it'll be back to the older versions in -release, which work.
[15:50] <Riddell> I'll rebuild kopete in ninjas
[16:04] <Riddell> hmm plasma-runners-addons  Breaks: kamoso (<< 2.0.2+)
[16:06] <Riddell> but there's no such thing as 2.0.2+ in debian
[16:08] <Riddell> mm it'll be the youtube icon but that's been renamed
[16:11] <ScottK> afiestas: Mabye we need a new kamoso release ...
[16:13] <Riddell> ah it's a packaging bug
[16:13] <afiestas> ScottK: yes :/
[16:13] <Riddell> but yeah a new kamoso release with those youtube icons renamed would make sense
[16:14] <afiestas> and with kipi plugin 2 support
[16:14] <afiestas> bleh, will do the release today
[16:14] <afiestas> though I don't have a webcam to test so I will need your help :p
[16:16] <afiestas> ScottK: Riddell can you try branch 2.1 ?
[16:16] <afiestas> don't mind the 2.1, we can release it as 2.0.2 if you need it that way
[16:17] <ScottK> 2.1 is fine.
[16:17]  * Riddell git clones kamoso
[16:18] <Riddell> afiestas: I want to do  git checkout remotes/origin/2.1 ?
[16:18] <afiestas> it should work just with
[16:18] <afiestas> git checkout 2.1
[16:19] <Riddell> oh problem, my webcam doesn't seem to be working
[16:19] <Riddell> it wasn't working with google handouts when we tried either
[16:20] <Riddell> anyone else able to help?
[16:24] <Riddell> afiestas: compiles and runs fine but my webcam doesn't want to work so not a good tester
[16:24] <Riddell> !testers | kamoso 2.1
[16:24] <ubottu> kamoso 2.1: Help is needed in #kubuntu-devel. Please ping Riddell, yofel, soee, Tm_T, shadeslayer, BluesKaj, James147, smartboyhw, Quintasan, lordievader, shrini, tester56 for information.
[16:25] <ScottK> OK, so I see the kopete build failed.
[16:25] <ScottK> I did rebuilt 4.10.97 successfully.
[16:26] <Quintasan> Riddell: I'm on it
[16:29] <Riddell> Quintasan: on kamoso?
[16:29] <Quintasan> Yes
[16:30] <Quintasan> afiestas: there is 2.0.2 and origin/2.1 branch, which one is it?
[16:30] <afiestas> 2.1
[16:31] <afiestas> 2.0 shouldn't be building with libkipi
[16:31] <Riddell> "protocols/jabber/googletalk/libjingle/talk/session/phone/linphonemediaengine.cc:203:57: error: 'AudioStream' has no member named 'ms'"
[16:32] <Riddell> this stuff is way more trouble that it's worth
[16:32] <ScottK> If you drop that, you can drop my changes to make it build on ppc
[16:35] <Quintasan> afiestas: Anything in particular I should look out for or general functionality testing will suffice?
[16:35] <Riddell> Quintasan: send us a mugshot!
[16:35] <afiestas> Quintasan: gneral functionality plus Youtube upload (that shouldn't wprk)
[16:39] <Quintasan> Riddell: http://wstaw.org/m/2013/08/12/picture_1.png
[16:39] <Quintasan> :D
[16:40] <Quintasan> afiestas: I need kipi-plugins to get yt upload?
[16:43] <afiestas> Quintasan: in theory no
[16:43] <afiestas> you need libkipi though
[16:45] <Quintasan> in practice I don't see YT upload option
[16:45] <Quintasan> hmm
[16:45]  * Quintasan rebuilds
[16:46] <Riddell> Quintasan: sexy times!
[16:47] <Quintasan> I really need to retake my profile picture
[16:47] <Quintasan> this time in HD
[16:48] <Quintasan> okay
[16:48] <Quintasan> afiestas: I have absolutely no idea how to try sending that video to YouTube :D
[16:48]  * Quintasan can't find any option to do that
[16:49] <afiestas> Quintasan: right click on the thumbnails?
[16:49] <Quintasan> afiestas: Trash or Open options there only
[16:49] <afiestas> uh
[16:49] <afiestas> that shouldn't happen
[16:49] <Quintasan> ii  libkipi10            4:4.10.2-0ubunt amd64           library for apps that want to use kipi-plugins
[16:49] <Quintasan> So libkipi is installed
[16:49] <Riddell> did it compile against it?
[16:50] <afiestas> do you have libkipi20 ?
[16:50] <Riddell> how about libkipi-dev ?
[16:50] <Quintasan> installed
[16:50] <Quintasan> and no libkipi20
[16:50] <Riddell> libkipi-dev and libkipi11
[16:50] <Riddell> ldd /usr/bin/kamoso | grep kipi
[16:50] <Riddell> should say /usr/lib/libkipi.so.11
[16:51] <Quintasan>         libkipi.so.10 => /usr/lib/libkipi.so.10 (0x00007ffbd57c3000)
[16:51] <Quintasan> It's linking against 10, guess I need to find my saucy vm
[16:51] <Quintasan> to try with 11
[16:53] <baltolkien> Akonadi and Nepomuk works in Kubuntu with KDE 4.11 RC?
[16:55] <Quintasan> baltolkien: I see no reason why it shouldn't
[16:55] <Blizzz> baltolkien: i lost my believe akonadi will work reliably one day
[16:55] <baltolkien> Well, In my laptop doesn't work
[16:55] <baltolkien> I just upgrade but doesn't work :(
[16:56] <baltolkien> Akonadi don't register at D-Bus
[16:58] <jbicha> is qt5 ok for transmission? or do you need this reverted for now? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/transmission/2.82-0ubuntu1
[16:58] <Riddell> Quintasan: you don't need saucy, you need kde sc 4.11
[16:58] <Riddell> Quintasan: what do you have?
[16:58] <Quintasan> 4.10 since I'm on my laptop
[16:59] <Quintasan> looking for the vm I have
[16:59] <jbicha> never mind, I guess you don't ship transmission by default anyway
[16:59] <Riddell> jbicha: um, I don't know, I've never used it
[17:01] <Riddell> jbicha: so you'd be as good testing it as anyone I guess
[17:06] <Quintasan> Riddell, afiestas: Uh, for yt upload it might take a while but the rest of Kamoso works normally
[17:06] <Quintasan> I can take pictures and videos and whatnot
[17:07] <Riddell> Quintasan: not got 4.11 installed?
[17:08] <Quintasan> Not on my laptop. I'd rather have stable stuff there installed
[17:08] <Quintasan> Riddell: My PC is running saucy but I'm back in hometown now so no access to it
[17:10] <Riddell> 4.11 is two days away from being stable :)
[17:10]  * Riddell uploads 4.11 to ninjas for raring
[17:16] <Blizzz> (except for akonadi, that is two eternities away – sorry for being grumpy)
[17:16] <ScottK> jbicha: Did you see http://perezmeyer.blogspot.com/2013/08/qt-in-debian-using-qt4-andor-qt5-in.html
[17:18] <jbicha> ScottK: I just added qt5-default to build-depends and transmission-qt built and ran which was good enough for me
[17:18] <ScottK> Yeah, that should be enough.
[17:25] <Riddell> ScottK: you're a debian ftpmaster?
[17:25] <ScottK> FTP assistant, but yes.
[17:25] <Riddell> elite :)
[17:28] <Quintasan> ScottK is so 1337 words are not enough :D
[17:28] <yofel> Quintasan: are the kipi-plugins installed
[17:28] <yofel> ?
[17:29] <Quintasan> yofel: Yes, they are. I already removed everything and I'm setting up virtualbox
[19:12] <jussi> yofel shadeslayer valorie please + or - the tshirts thing on the list
=== petersaints_ is now known as petersaints
[20:59] <valorie> will do
[20:59] <valorie> I still want a polo though
[22:48] <ScottK> Riddell and shadeslayer: Are you in the "Blue Systems developers working on Frameworks in August" group?
[23:04] <Riddell> ScottK: group where?
