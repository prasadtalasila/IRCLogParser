[00:02] <loadid_czech> sherry: are you sure you have all of your repositories enabled?
[00:03] <sherry> how cn I make sure about that?!
[00:05] <loadid_czech> actually doesn't look like dot is a program... why are you trying to install a program named dot?
[00:05] <sherry> in the http://github.com/ceph/ceph mentioned that I do need to install "dot" package, I just searched through packages.ubuntu.com and I found several packages with dot, but Im not sure which one it that!
[00:09] <loadid_czech> sherry: http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-graphviz-version-2263-ubuntu-1110-does-not-recognize-arcs-fromto-clusters
[00:10] <loadid_czech> looks like it's part of the graphviz program? maybe just not install dot and see if what you're trying to do still works
[00:11] <sherry> yeah 
[00:11] <sherry> alright thanks

[09:20] <faLUCE> hello. In software rendering example, this struct is allocated: drm_i915_gem_mmap_gtt.  From what I understadd, it allows memory access to the GTT by user space. 1) is that right? 2) in hw rendering, do I need the same struct too, or I have to drive the gpu access the gtt in other ways?
[09:21] <lordievader> faLUCE: Is this a development question? If so I think you are better of in the appropriate channels, this is Kubuntu support.
[09:22] <faLUCE> lordievader: LOL, sorry
[09:23] <lordievader> faLUCE: No problem.
[09:37] <ovidiu-florin> hello world
[09:40] <lordievader> Hey ovidiu-florin, how are you?
[09:43] <ovidiu-florin> hey lordievader
[09:44] <ovidiu-florin> I'm working on the Romanian Kubuntu website
[09:44] <ovidiu-florin> do you want to see it?
[09:44] <lordievader> Sure, I don't speak Romanian, but sure :)
[09:44] <ovidiu-florin> http://geekaliens.com/kubuntu.ro/
[09:45] <lordievader> That shadow is a bit strange, but overall looks sweet :)
[09:46] <ovidiu-florin> That slideshow still needs some work
[09:46] <ovidiu-florin> and some images
[09:47] <ovidiu-florin> Go to Descarcă Kubuntu (Download Kubuntu)
[09:48] <lordievader> Yes?
[09:48] <ovidiu-florin> That's what I'm working on currently
[09:48] <ovidiu-florin> I'm wondering if it's ok if I use the same images?
[09:49] <lordievader> Looks very familliar :D
[09:49] <ovidiu-florin> That's the ideea
[09:49] <ovidiu-florin> only, that I'm trying to make it a bit more organised (IMO)
[09:51] <lordievader> Shouldn't the first link be 13.04?
[09:51] <lordievader> Now you have 12.04 and 12.04.3
[09:51] <ovidiu-florin> that's the release notes
[09:55] <ovidiu-florin> I'm still figuring out how to make them both on the same page
[09:58] <lordievader> What do you mean exactly?
[10:03] <ovidiu-florin> on the official kubuntu site you have to go through 4-5 steps to download a ISO
[10:03] <ovidiu-florin> I want to reduce that
[10:17] <Guest50981> can anyone help me with this error http://pastebin.ca/2438735 ?
[10:19] <lordievader> Guest50981: I take it is Python? Do you have the package "python-gtk2" installed?
[10:19] <lordievader> And also "python-gi", Guest50981 
[10:20] <Guest50981> hm
[10:21] <Guest50981> python-gtk2 is already the newest version.
[10:21] <Guest50981> python-gtk2 set to manually installed.
[10:21] <Guest50981> python-gi is already the newest version
[10:22] <lordievader> Guest50981: I remember having this problem once, is "gir1.2-gtk-3.0" installed too?
[10:24] <Guest50981> let me see
[10:25] <Guest50981> lordievader,  girl was not there. I installed and got this . $ kazam
[10:25] <Guest50981> ERROR Kazam      - Could not find any typelib for AppIndicator3
[10:25] <Guest50981>         
[10:25] <Guest50981> but now kazam does runs
[10:26] <lordievader> Many programs throw that error, namely the jockey, not sure where it comes from. But it does no harm.
[10:45] <Guest50981> lordievader,  whats count down timer in kazam? and is there any other good recorder like it?
=== ghostcube_ is now known as ghostcube
[10:52] <Guest50981> lordievader,  is there any other tool like but better than "recorditnow"
[12:09] <BluesKaj> 'Morning all
[13:18] <boringntp> hello, the ntp service is started whenever i connect to a network with network-manager even though i've checked off "Set Date and Time automatically" option in the "Adjust Date and Time" menu; is there a way to avoid that?
[13:40] <natschil> Hello. Is there a table of graphics cards to how well they work on ubuntu somewhere? 
[13:43] <BluesKaj> !hardware
[13:43] <ubottu> For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport - To help debugging and improving hardware detection, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingHardwareDetection
[13:43] <BluesKaj> !graphics
[13:44] <BluesKaj> no infobot factoid for graphics 
[13:44] <BluesKaj> natschil, if you gives your graphics card model , that would help
[13:44] <BluesKaj> err give
[13:45] <natschil> BluesKaj: I'm looking to buy a laptop, and hence there are quite a lot of cards I would need to check
[13:46] <natschil> BluesKaj: I've had the experience of buying a laptop with less-than-optimal graphics support before on linux, and therefore now I'm trying to look in advance 
[13:47] <BluesKaj> natschil, ok , stay away froim the dual gpu laptops that use 2 gpu chips , one for low power mode and the other for high poiwer.... they're a pita to configure the drivers on linux
[13:48] <BluesKaj> well, most nvidia nad intels work well on linux , and ati is ok , but not as easy to configure 
[13:49] <natschil> BluesKaj: Do you know what the status of the open source nvidia drivers is? If possibly I'd like to use the open-source drivers as they tend to work "out of the box"
[13:50] <BluesKaj> there aren't any afaik, but the proprietary drivers in the ubuntu repos work well , mostly 
[13:50] <BluesKaj> natschil,^

[21:21] <aPpYe> hi there.  I am screwing around with a minimal KDE install from ubuntu mini.  I am a little confused by the different versions of kwin.  I get that the gles version is compiled without legacy opengl1x stuff, but what is kde-window-manager-active?
[21:44] <aPpYe> so no one can tell me the difference between the different versions of kwin?  kwin gles, kwin active gles,  ...
