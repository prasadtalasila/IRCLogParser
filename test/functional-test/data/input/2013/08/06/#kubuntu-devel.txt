[00:04] <Riddell> cute?
[00:05] <valorie> look at http://wiki.bodhilinux.com/doku.php
[00:05] <valorie> not my taste, but very colorful
[00:09] <Riddell> I think that looks quite classy
[00:10] <Riddell> by cute I thought there would be little unicorns all over it
[00:10]  * Riddell snoozes
[00:11] <valorie> lol
[00:41] <shadeslayer> valorie: what release?
[00:52] <ScottK> valorie: Did you dist-upgrade?
[00:52] <ScottK> You'll need to for the release that just hit raring-updates
[01:50] <manchicken> howdy
[01:51] <manchicken> I need to set up a proper environment.
[01:51] <manchicken> I can't test properly.
[01:54] <ScottK> Can you set up a VM running saucy?
[01:54] <ScottK> That's probably your best bet.
[01:54] <ScottK> (unless you've got a spare machine lying around)
[02:12] <manchicken> Just like a virtualbox.
[02:12] <manchicken> That's a good idea.
[02:19] <valorie> ScottK: thanks for asking -- I didn't do dist-upgrade
[02:19] <valorie> now when I do: 
[02:19] <valorie> The following packages have been kept back:
[02:19] <valorie>   kscreen
[02:19] <valorie> The following packages will be upgraded:
[02:19] <valorie>   libdbusmenu-glib4 libdbusmenu-gtk3-4 libdbusmenu-gtk4 xserver-xorg-video-intel
[02:19] <valorie> 4 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.
[02:19] <valorie> sorry for the delay in replying; was eating dinner, etc.
[02:55] <ScottK> valorie: what happens if you to sudo apt-get install kscreen?
[03:00] <valorie> The following extra packages will be installed:
[03:00] <valorie>   libkscreen1
[03:00] <valorie> The following packages will be REMOVED:
[03:00] <valorie>   libkscreen0
[03:00] <valorie> The following NEW packages will be installed:
[03:00] <valorie>   libkscreen1
[03:00] <valorie> The following packages will be upgraded:
[03:00] <valorie>   kscreen
[03:01] <valorie> 1 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
[03:01] <valorie> so maybe the lib was the blocker
[03:23] <manchicken> JontheEchidna: You there?
[03:31] <smartboyhw> JontheEchidna, please poll at http://doodle.com/2mwfbh9b7pbz3qzk :)
[03:40] <ScottK> valorie: Yes.  That was it.
[03:41] <valorie> cool
[03:42] <smartboyhw> ?
[03:43] <valorie> smartboyhw: you can get a BNC account from the KDE sysadmins, you know
[03:43] <smartboyhw> valorie, what's a BNC?
[03:43] <smartboyhw> (LOL)
[03:44] <valorie> http://community.kde.org/Sysadmin/BNC
[03:44] <valorie> it's a server which stays connected to your channels all the time
[03:44] <valorie> you connect to it rather than directly to IRC
[03:44] <valorie> like using screen
[03:44] <valorie> or the core in Quassel
[03:45] <smartboyhw> OK...
[03:45] <smartboyhw> But why do I need one?:P
[03:45] <valorie> so that you don't miss backlog
[03:45] <smartboyhw> valorie, well I can easily access it at irclogs.ubuntu.com (LOL)
[03:45] <valorie> eh
[03:46] <valorie> I hate having to rely on logs
[03:46] <valorie> I keep my own, but dredging through them.... ugh
[03:49] <smartboyhw> Hmm, I guess I have to fix the 12.04.3 version of calligra myself, sigh
[03:50] <smartboyhw> backporting just can't wor
[03:50] <smartboyhw> *work
[03:50] <smartboyhw> I mean, for opencolorio
[03:58] <smartboyhw> lunchtime
[04:07] <manchicken> Man, setting up a virtualbox instance takes longer than it looks.
[04:12] <manchicken> Anybody use Qt Creator?
[04:13] <manchicken> I'm trying to build this thing and it says invalid argument "c"
[04:29] <manchicken> Okay, trying to build libqapt... why is it complaining about qt4?!
[06:18] <soee> good morning
[06:22] <shadeslayer> morning soee
=== Oli`` is now known as oli
[08:12] <lordievader> Good morning.
[08:17] <shadeslayer> oh
[08:17] <shadeslayer> yofel: did you upload without the LTS HWE stack already?
[08:17] <yofel> yes
[08:17] <yofel> the 12.04.1 packages are ok
[08:17] <shadeslayer> \o/
[08:17] <yofel> what still doesn't work is kubuntu-lts-backport though :/
[08:18] <shadeslayer> oh?
[08:18]  * shadeslayer looks
[08:18] <shadeslayer> yofel: even the upgrade went fine?
[08:20] <shadeslayer> btw Destop at home is having weird X issues on precise
[08:20] <shadeslayer> I have autologin enabled, however, sometimes, I get a tty
[08:20] <smartboyhw> Hey yofel shadeslayer 
[08:20] <smartboyhw> YES!!!!!!
[08:21] <smartboyhw> Calligra 2.7.1 on 12.04 DONE
[08:21] <shadeslayer> no ksplash or anything, just a simple tty
[08:21] <smartboyhw> \o/
[08:21]  * shadeslayer will try out the HWE stack on that machine
[08:21] <yofel> shadeslayer: yeah, I've seen that, I blame KDM, but it might very well be X as well
[08:28] <smartboyhw> yofel, how's digikam backporting?
[08:28] <yofel> good, I think
[08:28] <yofel> I'll tell you after I actually tested it
[08:28] <shadeslayer> o_o
[08:28] <smartboyhw> yofel, :)
[08:28] <shadeslayer> just installing kubuntu-lts-backport doesn't work
[08:29] <shadeslayer> but if you pass xserver-xorg-lts-raring as well, it works :D
[08:39] <smartboyhw> yofel, shadeslayer which date would you prefer, 12th or 16th for the Kubuntu Developer meeting?
[08:40] <smartboyhw> Both of them have the same number of polls
[08:40] <smartboyhw> Yes: 4 If-needed-be: 3 No: 0 (excluding valorie)
[08:41] <shadeslayer> Monday seems to be more favorable to everyone>
[08:41] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, not me:P
[08:41] <smartboyhw> Tbh
[08:42] <smartboyhw> Monday I'm only if-needed-be
[08:42] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: whatever suits you best then
[08:45] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, but some people haven't voted yet, that's a concern for me
[08:45] <smartboyhw> I mean, minimum requirement is 3 actually...
[08:45] <smartboyhw> But, more people is better:P
[08:46] <shadeslayer> more people means worse for you actually :P
[08:46] <Quintasan> wait what
[08:47] <Quintasan> Which David left us?
[08:47] <shadeslayer> Wonderly
[08:47] <Quintasan> Aw.
[08:47] <shadeslayer> kinda
[08:47] <shadeslayer> he's trying out feodra 
[08:47] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, why?
[08:47] <Quintasan> He is going to learn that Kubuntu is better sooner or later :P
[08:48] <smartboyhw> For LOL purposes
[08:48] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, +1
[08:48] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: you're open to a wider variety of questions then :P
[08:48] <shadeslayer> the grilling goes on longer
[08:48] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, well that's good
[08:48] <shadeslayer> :>
[08:48] <yofel> smartboyhw: he was tired of the whole ubuntu community bikeshedding and arguing lately as I understood
[08:48] <smartboyhw> yofel, yeah
[08:48] <shadeslayer> yep ^^
[08:48] <Quintasan> lol ubuntu edge?
[08:48] <smartboyhw> yofel, I know that, it's Quintasan who's asking:PO
[08:48] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, no
[08:48] <yofel> well, not longer, meeting is 1h usually, you just get more questions ^^
[08:48] <smartboyhw> The Mir thing?
[08:49] <Quintasan> Oh, so when we are grilling smartboyhw?
[08:49] <shadeslayer> yep, took about an hour when I applied
[08:50] <shadeslayer> yofel: I propose we just add an instruction in the release notes to instal kubuntu-lts-backports and the x11 lts package
[08:50] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, probably 16th or 12th
[08:50] <smartboyhw> The two most polled dates
[08:50] <smartboyhw> I will try to avoid 12th
[08:51] <smartboyhw> I'm happy that you guys are grilling me actually
[08:51] <Quintasan> Yeah!
[08:51] <smartboyhw> That improves my reactions skills:P
[08:51] <shadeslayer> famous last words :P
[08:51]  * Quintasan prepares some spices
[08:51] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, how many last words do you have!?
[08:51] <shadeslayer> one for every occassion
[08:52] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, meh
[08:52] <shadeslayer> for everything else there's mastercard xD
[08:52] <smartboyhw> XD
[08:52] <smartboyhw> Why not Visa?
[08:52] <smartboyhw> Or American Express
[08:52] <smartboyhw> Or JCB (XD)
[08:52] <shadeslayer> because that's a line from the mastercard ad we have here?
[08:52] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh
[08:53] <smartboyhw> We don't have Mastercard or Visa ads here
[08:53] <smartboyhw> (Well, maybe Visa)
[08:53] <smartboyhw> We only have bank ads
[08:54] <shadeslayer> I see, I don't think I've seen a visa ad here
[08:54] <smartboyhw> Oh, interesting
[08:55] <shadeslayer> or maybe the visa ad was crap and I don't remember it
[08:55] <shadeslayer> kind of funny though, VISA is more prevalent in the US, but a MasterCard is much more common in the EU
[08:57] <yofel> I don't remember many VISA Ads here in germany either. But you simply cannot miss the MC one.
[08:57] <shadeslayer> ^^
[08:57] <smartboyhw> lol
[08:58] <shadeslayer> yofel: the first time I travelled to the EU was to Germany and I *could not* find a machine that accepts VISA
[08:58] <shadeslayer> *accepted
[08:58] <shadeslayer> Desktop Summit IIRC
[09:00] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, :I
[09:05] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, show me the log of your grilling:P
[09:07] <shadeslayer> no cheating :P
[09:07] <smartboyhw> Uh, anyway, I found it shadeslayer :P
[09:07] <shadeslayer> haha
[09:08] <smartboyhw> So, questions include freezes, whoo
[09:08] <smartboyhw> Good that I know freezes;P
[09:09] <smartboyhw> Whoa, that meeting's 1 hour 15 minutes:I
[09:09] <yofel> it is *at least* 1h
[09:10] <smartboyhw> yofel, yeah sure, I think I will take 3 hours:P
[09:10] <yofel> nah
[09:10] <smartboyhw> Starting at 13:00 UTC is a brillant idea:P
[09:10] <smartboyhw> It now only depends on date.
[09:10] <yofel> the main difference between the ~kubuntu-members meeting and the ~kubuntu-dev one is that latter is mostly about technical competence
[09:10] <smartboyhw> yofel, yep
[09:11] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[09:12] <yofel> and a bit of a sanity check ^^
[09:13] <smartboyhw> yofel, sanity check? i.e.?
[09:13] <yofel> after all you essentiall get root permissions on user systems without reviews. (Sure, that's already the case for ~kubuntu-ppa, but the primary archive still offers more damage potential)
[09:13] <yofel> *essentially
[09:21] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.devel.security/17506
[09:21] <shadeslayer> which is why a sanity check is required
[09:22] <shadeslayer> just making sure you're not affiliated with the NSA/FBI :P
[09:24] <yofel> that reminds me of someone's post on g+ about how easy it is to verify that a binary is really built from it's associated source
[09:24] <yofel> thinking of it, in debian that's not easy at all
[09:24] <shadeslayer> IIRC that post concluded that it was easiest in Debian
[09:24] <yofel> for us it's less of an issue, but we still need to trust the buildd's to be non-compromised
[09:25] <yofel> shadeslayer: binNMU's ?
[09:25] <shadeslayer> no, RPM
[09:25] <shadeslayer> no, RPM's had different sizes and what not
[09:25] <yofel> ah, I don't know much about RPM's, but that would be fun indeed
[09:26] <shadeslayer> this one I think https://blogs.kde.org/2013/06/19/really-source-code-software
[09:26] <yofel> exactly
[09:26] <yofel> didn't yet have time to read the full post :/
[09:29]  * shadeslayer needs to come up with hard questions for soee
[09:29] <shadeslayer> erm
[09:29] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw
[09:44] <Blizzz> anyone an idea how to track down this?  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=322562 also looks like i cannot save my KDE session
[09:44] <ubottu> KDE bug 322562 in general "copied system from HDD to SSD: KWallet does not open despite correct password" [Normal,Unconfirmed]
[09:44] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, I know about that post
[09:44] <smartboyhw> Good question, really...
[09:44] <smartboyhw> Riddell, can you do the post for Calligra 2.7.1 on web for me?
=== vinay is now known as Guest54040
[09:55] <markey> when is the freeze date again for 13.10?
[09:56] <markey> nvm it doesn't really matter
[09:57] <smartboyhw> markey, why?
[09:58] <markey> because I just recalled that Amarok 2.8 is in anyway
[09:58] <smartboyhw> markey, ;)
[10:04] <Tm_T> I miss Amarok /:
[10:06] <markey> where did it go?
[10:06] <Tm_T> I don't tend to have local files for that purpose anymore, Google Music took me
[10:06] <smartboyhw> Tm_T, oh
[10:09] <Tm_T> I do keep local copies, but they're on a machine I don't use for anything else but storing files
[10:20] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[10:22] <markey> hey guys, an Amarok user is sometimes getting this backtrace. that's with the latest Qt update, on Raring:
[10:22] <markey> http://pastebin.com/tMdZaMAY
[10:23] <markey> can you make sense of this? 
[10:27] <markey> Tm_T: yeah I think Google Music is interesting. it's not yet available in Germany though, I think
[10:32] <smartboyhw> Riddell, uh anyway I will do the news myself
[10:40] <Riddell> thanks smartboyhw 
[10:48] <Tm_T> markey: neither in Finland

[11:36] <yofel> urgh
[11:37] <yofel> I'll update that
[11:37] <yofel> needs to be ubuntu14
[11:37] <markey> you think that will fix it?
[11:38] <yofel> yes, because the same patch that was added in ubuntu9.1 in raring-updates, was added in saucy ubuntu10, and fixed in 14
[11:38] <yofel> ppa has 12 which is broken
[11:40] <markey> there's been so much bad stuff going on with Ubuntu Qt packages lately...
[11:40] <markey> not nice
[11:40] <markey> why is it all falling apart?
[11:41] <yofel> well *this* happened because the developer thought that just calling gtk code from qt is fine
[11:41] <yofel> sadly gtk and Qt don't behave the same on X errors, (qt: warning, gtk: error)
[12:37] <manchicken> Anybody know how to get VirtualBox extras to work on Saucy? :)
[12:38] <manchicken> It doesn't like the xorg version. I'm trying to use VirtualBox for testing of my changes without trashing my box :)
[12:41] <shadeslayer> manchicken: hm?
[12:41] <smartboyhw> Whoa, I didn't expect that Kubuntu Developer application questions include array[] and array* (fortunately I know a bit of C++ to know this)
[12:41] <shadeslayer> manchicken: sure
[12:42] <manchicken> There is an application now?
[12:42] <shadeslayer> manchicken: install kubuntu in VM -> post installation install virtualbox-guest-{utils,x11} -> restart
[12:42] <smartboyhw> Oh, new release of kde-telepathy
[12:42] <smartboyhw> kubotu: newversion kde-telepathy 0.6.3
[12:43] <kubotu> Package kde-telepathy doesn't exist yet!
[12:43] <shadeslayer> manchicken: and then if you want to access USB devices you'll need the VBox extension pack
[12:43] <smartboyhw> Ah, ktp:P
[12:43] <shadeslayer> heh
[12:44] <smartboyhw> BTW, why do you guys have to split ktp into multiple sources?
[12:44] <yofel> huh? upstream splits it like that
[12:45] <shadeslayer> ^^
[12:45] <yofel> and thanks virtualbox for freezing my system @_@
[12:46] <shadeslayer> I blame d_ed

[13:16] <shadeslayer> yes
[13:16] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yeah, idiot me:P
[13:17] <shadeslayer> just file a single one under meta-kde-telepathy
[13:17] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh
[13:17] <shadeslayer> if you really want to
[13:17] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, changed the bug:P
[13:18] <shadeslayer> k
[13:37] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, are the translation .mo files not supposed to go in ktp-call-ui?
[13:37] <smartboyhw> There isn't a not-installed file, so I'm worried
[13:37] <shadeslayer> they should yes
[13:38] <shadeslayer> For certain apps I did not install the mo files a long time back since I did not understand the lang pack stuff properly
[13:39] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, so I'll add it back
[13:39] <shadeslayer> Not that I understand it completely at the moment, but basically everything outside KDE SC should have mo's installed
[13:39] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: yes plz
[13:52] <smartboyhw> First time ever
[13:52] <smartboyhw> .3$ dh_install --list-missing

[13:52] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, is that suppose to happen?
[13:53] <shadeslayer> need the full log plz
[13:54] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, http://paste.kde.org/pa77e0cd9/
[13:57] <shadeslayer> I don't see a error there
[13:57] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, because the error is above:P
[13:57] <smartboyhw> The dh_install --list-missing thing
[13:58] <smartboyhw> So, weird weird
[13:58] <shadeslayer> I'd say just upload to a PPA

[14:19] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer (or others): Why is 02_ktpchat_soversion.diff still existing in ktp-text-ui?
[14:19] <smartboyhw> It's 0.5.80
[14:19] <smartboyhw> But now the package is already 0.6.3
[14:20] <smartboyhw> And do I have to update meta-kde-telepathy as well?
[14:53] <tsimpson> apachelogger: in case you get concerned, ubottu.com now points to a new server (and IP) so the SSH fingerprint has changed
[15:17] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, answer my question:P
[15:17] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: in a meeting
[15:18] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, oh, I thought you are chatting:P
[15:18] <shadeslayer> meeting + chatting + dinnering
[15:18] <shadeslayer> 02_ktpchat_soversion.diff ... yeah, bump that :)
[15:18] <shadeslayer> or well
[15:18] <shadeslayer> not required tbh
[15:18] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, drop patch?
[15:18] <shadeslayer> no
[15:19] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, change patch?
[15:19] <smartboyhw> to 0.6.3?
[15:19] <shadeslayer> I don't think it's required
[15:20] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, so what's the solution? (I can't understand)
[15:23] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: basically, it doesn't matter IMHO
[15:23] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, uh alright
[15:23] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: it's a patch to introduce a so versioned lib instead of a unversioned lib that upstream ships
[15:24] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, and should I update meta-kde-telepathy itself too?
[15:25] <shadeslayer> yes
[15:25] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, OK:)
[15:31] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer (or others), please review all ktp packages at https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/packaging-staging-1/+packages
[15:31] <shadeslayer> tomorrow
[15:31] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, sure, no prob
[15:31] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: did you do those by hand?
[15:32] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, what do you mean, by hand?
[15:32] <smartboyhw> Well, yes
[15:32] <shadeslayer> lol?
[15:32] <shadeslayer> I think Quintasan wrote a script
[15:32] <smartboyhw> if you mean changing the .install files and updating debian/control
[15:32] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, .............
[15:32] <smartboyhw> Damit
[15:32] <Quintasan> top lel
[15:33] <Quintasan> this is piling on me
[15:33] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, ?
[15:33] <Quintasan> crapton of things to do right now
[15:33] <Quintasan> I'M NOT HERE FOR ONE WEEK
[15:34]  * smartboyhw is confused with Quintasan 
[15:35] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: You're trying to apply logic everywhere
[15:35] <Quintasan> It's pointless
[15:35]  * smartboyhw can't understand even without applying logic...
[15:36] <Quintasan> Well, extrapolate then
[15:36] <Quintasan> I just have too much things to do atm
[15:36] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, sure... sure... sure...
[15:36] <Quintasan> and instead of taking one thing at a time I'm trying to do everything at once
[15:36] <Quintasan> and now I have even more things to do
[15:36] <Quintasan> I'd better try old approach
[15:38] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, heh
[15:38] <smartboyhw> Sigh...
[15:55] <smartboyhw> OK, can somebody review + upload https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/2buntu/+files/plasma-mediacenter_1.0.90-0ubuntu1.dsc ? It's 5 days old..

[17:40] <soee> how can i disable nvidia card sound device ?
[17:48] <BluesKaj> soee, what's the driver name ?
[17:49] <soee> BluesKaj, dont know its hdmi related
[17:49] <yofel> can't you just mute it in kmix?
[17:51] <BluesKaj> soee, look in  /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf  , if it's the default soundcard it will have a line like : options snd-ice1724 index=0 . Whatever that line is  change the index=0 to -2
[17:53] <soee> BluesKaj, http://pastebin.com/zbZHA6pH
[17:56] <BluesKaj> soee, what does this show , cat /proc/asound/modules
[17:56] <soee> BluesKaj, 0 snd_hda_intel
[17:56] <soee>  1 snd_ca0106
[17:57] <BluesKaj> ok , sou have a pci soundcard as well as the intel onboard ?
[17:58] <BluesKaj> sou = you
[17:58] <soee> but intel should be disabled in bios
[17:58] <soee> and i have additional SB card that i want to use
[18:02] <BluesKaj> when it's listed as "0" , that's default , the ca0106 is probly the soundblaster card . add these lines to the alsa-base file ,: options snd_hda_intel index=-2 , then below that, options snd_ca0106 index=0 , then you'll probly need to reboot  
[18:04] <BluesKaj> also to make sure after rebooting run , sudo modprobe snd_ca0106 , if there's no text output then the module is loaded properly
