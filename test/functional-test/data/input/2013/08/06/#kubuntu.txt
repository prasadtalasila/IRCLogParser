[05:40] <jussi> bigbrovar: I didnt, but I read a guide somewhere - I can try find it again if you like?
[05:40] <bigbrovar> jussi: sure that would be nice :) been googling for it too
[05:42] <jussi> bigbrovar: what model pc do you have?
[05:43] <bigbrovar> jussi: it's not a popular model (its produced by a company in my country Nigeria) called Zinox. but lsusb shows the reader is upek
[05:44] <jussi> bigbrovar: upek has its own proprietry firmware iirc
[05:44] <jussi> bigbrovar: should then be same as this gide stuff: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_enable_the_integrated_fingerprint_reader
[05:45] <bigbrovar> jussi: Thanks.. I am actually on that page now.. my concern is whether it would work with lightdm-kde
[05:46] <bigbrovar> most of the guide seem too gnome/ubuntu oriented..
[05:46] <bigbrovar> would be cool to be able to unlock my screen via the reader

[08:23] <nova_> When I scroll, either with mouse or by clicking in the scrollbar, when using either firefox or chrome with the program "maximized", I get a long (1-2 second) freezes of the page.  If I make the window smaller than full screen there is no pause, with either browser.  Does Anyone have any idea what might be causing this?

[11:32] <alvin> nova_: I'm thinking of "smooth scrolling". Try disabling it: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Scrolling_is_slow
[11:34] <alvin> bigbrovar: A few years ago I also wanted to use my fingerprint reader. I gave up. There's not much developer interest because it's not a safe technique after all. So, nobody bothers implementing it.

[19:14] <AlexZion> any I dea about how to fix it ?
[19:25] <yofel> AlexZion: could you please pastebin your /var/log/apt/history.log ?
[19:29] <yofel> AlexZion: found the issue, on it
[19:32] <AlexZion> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5956143 yofel
[19:41] <yofel> AlexZion: until that's fixed, this whould give you digikam and kipi back: apt-get install digikam kipi-plugins libgphoto2-port0=2.4.14-2 libgphoto2-2=2.4.14-2
[19:45] <AlexZion> doesn't works yofel
[19:45] <yofel> what does it say?
[19:45] <AlexZion> same as before ...
[19:47] <yofel> uhm, well, what? In my chroot here it works...
[19:48] <yofel> AlexZion: actually, try to refresh your package cache now and just try to install digikam
