[00:05] <shadowbroker> so in #bash, we found out that kde doesn't use a login shell >.>
[00:05] <shadowbroker> kinda bs imo, as it should be loading .bash_profile as expected
[00:05] <shadowbroker> but it doesnt because kde is special :/
[00:07] <NanduX> it's not just kde, I think most of them don't use login shells
[00:07] <shadowbroker> regardless, kde's implementation is, imo, incorrect
[00:08] <shadowbroker> i should be able to expect .bash_profile to load when i login, pure and simple

[04:00] <Whiskey`Wonka> anyone know how or if its possible to reset the video driver with out rebooting? using 13.04 with a intel gma using the i915 kernel driver
[04:06] <NanduX> Whiskey`Wonka, modprobe -r <driver_name> and then modprobe <driver_name>
[04:07] <Whiskey`Wonka> NanduX: eek, was hoping for something less drastic
[04:08] <NanduX> a reboot is safer, since you'll have to stop X before unloading the driver, just to be sure
[04:08] <Whiskey`Wonka> right and stopping X means stopping all the apps first, uhg
[04:08] <NanduX> yep
[04:10] <Whiskey`Wonka> well, ok what is happening is that i play counterstrike source via wine. sometimes, and it might be a hour or it might be 3 weeks, the 3d performance drops to near nill. google earth is also effected. i dont really ue any other 3d softwares
[04:14] <NanduX> well, Intel stinks at graphics as far as I know...
[04:16] <Whiskey`Wonka> yes i am well aware of that. this works well enough to do 40~50fps in CS, run google earth and minecraft when i need to manage a server so i live with it
[04:16] <Whiskey`Wonka> just would like to not have to reboot every time this comes up
[04:24] <GiGaHuRtZ> Whiskey`Wonka: steam wont run on the i915?
[04:24] <GiGaHuRtZ> I know it wouldnt work with CS source with the GMA3500, but a mesa update fixed that from xorg-edgers
[04:25] <[Relic]> How does one fix Moun?  It is stuck with 1 upgradeable package that refuses to upgrade or be removed
[04:27] <Whiskey`Wonka> [Relic]: use apt-get
[04:27] <Whiskey`Wonka> GiGaHuRtZ: no it runs fine till something breaks and this blamo ALL 2d apps run at 4~5 FPS
[04:27] <Whiskey`Wonka> er 3d
[04:27] <Whiskey`Wonka> minecraft, cs:s, google earth
[04:28] <GiGaHuRtZ> hmmm
[04:28] <[Relic]> and do what with it?
[04:28] <GiGaHuRtZ> try upgrading X11, mesa, etc
[04:28] <Whiskey`Wonka> GiGaHuRtZ: i have
[04:28] <GiGaHuRtZ> [Relic]: apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:28] <GiGaHuRtZ> Whiskey`Wonka: from xorg-edgers?
[04:29] <Whiskey`Wonka> uhm, mmm, thats a good , not sure im using that on this one
[04:29] <GiGaHuRtZ> I dont know why you would run CSS in wine if it works in steam on your card
[04:29] <[Relic]> a dist upgrade to get rid of one package that is stuck in the system
[04:29] <GiGaHuRtZ> you are saying a package that is not upgraded
[04:30] <GiGaHuRtZ> yes dist-upgrade will fix that
[04:30] <Whiskey`Wonka> [Relic]: apt-get install saidpackagenamehere
[04:30] <GiGaHuRtZ> nt that it really matters anyway
[04:30] <GiGaHuRtZ> anyways, bbiab

[04:31] <[Relic]> Unable to mark upgrades. Some upgrades may have unsatisfiable dependencies at the moment, or may have been manually held back.
[04:31] <[Relic]> so it is still stuck in muon just not accessible now
=== CoreyTrevor is now known as TrevorCorey
[04:32] <Whiskey`Wonka> do as GiGaHuRtZ said, you just have a mix of packages that end up blocking
[04:33] <[Relic]> using apt-get purge doesn't remove it from muon, this little bugger is annoying
[04:35] <[Relic]> well that was fun; seems the problem was another package was upgradeable but not showing at all but only showing the dependancy package instead which never upgraded/installed due to the upgradeable one not showing
[04:39] <GiGaHuRtZ> apt-get -f install
[04:39] <GiGaHuRtZ> no packages

[11:16] <BluesKaj> vedu_, more details please
[11:18] <vedu_> BluesKaj: I have a LAN connection that is connected to the internet. I want to create a "ad-hoc" wifi hub using my computer's wifi so that other computers can connect and use the internet in the LAN connection
[11:28] <BluesKaj> vedu_, ok describe your actual setup and connection to the internet , and how you want the other computers to connect ..it's still not clear to me
[11:29] <BluesKaj> and what equipment router/modem etc you use
[11:35] <vedu_> BluesKaj: I want to use my laptop's wifi to share the internet connected to my laptop's LAN card
[11:40] <BluesKaj> vedu_, this is an ubuntu tutorial but using network manager should be very similar,  http://tumutanzi.com/archives/8195
[11:49] <vedu> BluesKaj: I followed the steps till step 5 but step 6 onwards its rather Ubuntu specific. could you help m eout
[11:55] <BluesKaj> vedu, wish I could but I don't use network manager , and the wifi on our network is handled by the router/modem'

[14:48] <GiGaHuRtZ> Anyone around willing to help with a depmod, kernel, dpkg/apt issue?
[14:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> Every since installing something last night, from a ppa I believe (which I have since purged) I cant get apt-get or dpkg to complete fully
[14:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> Well a dpkg --configure -a
[14:49] <ikonia> you need to check the PPA's packages have been purgred
[14:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> ikonia: Dude, I am ignoring you
[14:49] <ikonia> as they are the most likely cause of a conflict
[14:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> And you dont even know my problem
[14:49] <ikonia> you've just asked the problem ?
[14:49] <GiGaHuRtZ> Because I havent said what the problem is
[14:50] <ikonia> you can't apt-get fully
[14:50] <ikonia> that sounds like the problem ?
[14:50] <GiGaHuRtZ> ......
[14:50] <GiGaHuRtZ> i can apt get plenty of things
[14:50] <ikonia> and a PPA causing a conflict is normally the common cause, not always,
[14:50] <GiGaHuRtZ> its the kernel it fails on
[14:50] <ikonia> GiGaHuRtZ: was the kernel from a PPA
[14:50] <GiGaHuRtZ> Does matter if its liquorix, maiunline from ubuntu, stock ubuntu, etc
[14:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> npot a ppa, no
[14:51] <ikonia> yes, it does matter
[14:51] <sithlord48> GiGaHuRtZ:  can you pastebin ur error for me
[14:51] <ikonia> as that's whats likely to break the dependencies, hence apt-get failing
[14:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> ikonia: no, it doesnt.
[14:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> It does it it with ALL kernels
[14:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> ffs
[14:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> kernels that were just working and hadnt been updated
[14:51] <ikonia> GiGaHuRtZ: sure, most probably due to a dependency conflict
[14:51] <ikonia> GiGaHuRtZ: tone down the language please - there isn't a need for it
[14:51] <GiGaHuRtZ> Ive researched enoiugh myself to know its dxue to another issue
[14:52] <ikonia> GiGaHuRtZ: ok, what issue is it due to ?
[14:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> so please, sto[p talking to me
[14:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> Im far from the only person that doesnt like you in the *buntu channels
[14:52] <ikonia> GiGaHuRtZ: if you know what the issue is, please expand on it explaining what the issue is
[14:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> And your opership is being taken up with the ubuntu council
[14:52] <ikonia> GiGaHuRtZ: I'm not really interested if you like me or not,
[14:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> But for now, /i9gnore
[14:52] <GiGaHuRtZ> sithlord48: one sec
[14:53] <GiGaHuRtZ> I woiuldve pasted longer, but ikonia likes to wage a global irc nerd war abgainst me i9n every channel
[14:53] <ikonia> GiGaHuRtZ: it doesn't change your problem sounds like it's from a package conflict, - unless you can clarify what where you think the problem lies
[14:54] <sithlord48> can you also tell me what you have installed from what ppa also (i know you purged it but it might be helpful)
[14:54] <slatenails> i don't think he can really tell anything heh
[15:04] <BluesKaj> not sorry to see him go
[15:05] <sithlord48> i guess i missed something then
[15:05] <BluesKaj> he's not really venomous as just a plain pita
[15:06] <BluesKaj> sithlord48, not really
[15:08] <sithlord48> i had a strange nepomuk issue but im not really sure its an issue or just outside its use case.
[15:09] <sithlord48> turns out ms.sith has had really bad proformance on her machine lately. and high temps for months now. couldn't figure it out..

[15:43] <Nightrose>  `Pre-Depends' field, invalid package name `m�ltiarch-support': character `�' not allowed (only letters, digits and characters `-+._')
[15:43] <Nightrose> known problem?
[15:43] <Nightrose> anything i can do to fix it?
[15:44] <Avihay> I've upgraded to 4.11, and now I can't see skype windows of all things... anyone bumped into the issue?
[15:45] <ikonia> Nightrose: shouldn't it be "multiarch"
[15:45] <ikonia> Nightrose: with a "u"
[15:45] <Nightrose> ikonia: it should yes
[15:46] <ikonia> Nightrose: where is this package, in what repo
[15:46] <Nightrose> i have no idea
[15:46] <ikonia> !info libgsm1
[15:46] <ubottu> libgsm1 (source: libgsm): Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor. In component main, is optional. Version 1.0.13-4 (raring), package size 26 kB, installed size 102 kB
[15:46] <ikonia> Nightrose: got any PPA's enabled ?
[15:47] <Nightrose> they should all be disabled since i am in the middle of a distro upgrade
[15:47] <ikonia> Nightrose: (I'm assuing this is raring your using)
[15:47] <Nightrose> (that didn't go too well)
[15:47] <ikonia> Nightrose: disabled isn't enough
[15:47] <ikonia> Nightrose: disabling them doesn't remove packages which can be bad/cause a conflict
[15:47] <Nightrose> k
[15:48] <Nightrose> do you have a tip for how to investigate this further?
[15:48] <ikonia> Nightrose: well, I'd look at where that package is coming from - then check it's dependencies, and if it's got an invalid charset in the name, log a bug for it explaining
[15:48] <Nightrose> how do i find out?
[15:48] <ikonia> Nightrose: are you upgrading to/from what distro ?
[15:48] <Nightrose> from raring to saucy
[15:49] <ikonia> really...you're upgrading to a development version and you've had ppa's installed and you've no idea how to manage packages/dependencies ?
[15:49] <ikonia> this sounds like a bad idea
[15:50] <Nightrose> it probably is - i was offered the upgrade - but ok - let me see what i can find out about the package
[15:50] <ikonia> you shouldn't have been offered it
[15:50] <ikonia> unless you did update-manager -d
[15:51] <ikonia> interesting the package version is the name in raring and saucy
