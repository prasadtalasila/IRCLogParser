[21:55] <xnox> smoser: hallyn_: it does make sense for upstart-file-bridge to ship a job that watches "/" and if "/etc" is created execute initctl reload-configuration. As that job will never be triggered on normal machines, but will be triggered on "overlayfs is bodging inode under our feet"
[21:56] <xnox> or hint, you can drop one yourself in the image =)
[21:56] <xnox> but you should do that on the base-dir, not in the overlay dif.

[23:02] <robert_ancell> mterry, around?
[23:02] <mterry> robert_ancell, yeah, hi
[23:03] <robert_ancell> mterry, hey, reading bug 1212408. I don't think it can be done without what you proposed in http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2011-July/012004.html
[23:03] <ubottu> bug 1212408 in lightdm (Ubuntu) "lightdm needs to set $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1212408
[23:03] <robert_ancell> Do you know about the bug / did your proposal go anywhere?
[23:05] <mterry> robert_ancell, never went anywhere.  I recall particular resistance from GNOME people.  I got the impression they weren't concerned with the problem space
[23:06] <mterry> robert_ancell, I think historically we've patched gnome-session and its .desktop files to add a new key to specify the desktop
[23:06] <mterry> robert_ancell, I think the request is to move this up the stack into lightdm, rather than gnome-session
[23:06] <mterry> or down the stack anyway
[23:07] <mterry> robert_ancell, because now user-upstart is parallel to gnome-session I guess
[23:07] <robert_ancell> mterry, ah, I didn't see them in the xsession files, right it would have to be inside gnome-session
[23:07] <robert_ancell> yes
[23:07] <robert_ancell> request makes sense, just LightDM can't work out the names (http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apb.html) unless they're in the xsession file
[23:07] <mterry> robert_ancell, yeah, I think that's still a sensible place for them.  But for now, we'd maybe want to prefix X-Ubuntu- or something
[23:07] <robert_ancell> yep, agreed
[23:08] <robert_ancell> X-LightDM for now I guess
[23:08] <mterry> robert_ancell, hey, are you still interested in unity8-greeter-on-the-desktop?  I dropped that for now (thought you wanted it for some demo purpose), but I wanted to double check
[23:09] <robert_ancell> mterry, not for demo purposes, though I'd like to check it works for phone purposes
[23:09] <robert_ancell> thanks
[23:14] <mterry> robert_ancell, I have branches to get most of the way on the phone, but got blocked by u-s-c not really being able to switch between greeter/user-sessions.  Seems like Mir doesn't register them as sessions (racarr suggested that the lack of the whole nested Mir feature was the problem)
[23:15] <robert_ancell> mterry, right, they can't be mir servers, but we can test the greeter as a mir client with a u7 session
[23:15] <mterry> robert_ancell, oh I see.  You're saying you wanted it on the desktop, as proof of concept for phone?
[23:15] <robert_ancell> I was hoping we could test on desktop as that might be easier. But it seem the dependencies make too many phone assumptions.
[23:15] <robert_ancell> yes
[23:16] <mterry> robert_ancell, yeah, it seems that the unity8 engine that drives unity8-greeter needs qtubuntu stuff that isn't fully there for the desktop
[23:16] <robert_ancell> right. That was my conclusion too
[23:17] <robert_ancell> mterry, though I talked to ricmm and he said he should be unblocked to land qtubuntu mir stuff into the archive now
[23:19] <robert_ancell> mterry, would you be able to review the MP when I add the XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP support? Shouldn't be too complex
[23:19] <mterry> robert_ancell, OK.  Just wanted to make sure you weren't waiting on a deliverable from me
[23:19] <mterry> I mean, you'd still like it, but it's not blocking you
[23:19] <mterry> robert_ancell, OK
[23:20] <robert_ancell> mterry, not blocked
[23:20] <robert_ancell> mterry, do I have anything specific blocking you?
[23:20] <mterry> robert_ancell, no...?  let me review
[23:20] <robert_ancell> there's no need to review ;)
[23:20] <mterry> robert_ancell, naw
[23:21] <robert_ancell> mterry, you're in boston right?
[23:21] <mterry> robert_ancell, yeah
[23:22] <robert_ancell> mterry, we're (Mir team+QA) in town (Lexington) the week of the 16th Sept - should catch up!
[23:22] <mterry> robert_ancell, oh nice!
[23:22] <mterry> robert_ancell, yeah
