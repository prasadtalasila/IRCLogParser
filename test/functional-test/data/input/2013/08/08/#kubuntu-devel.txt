[03:46] <shadeslayer> ack

[03:46] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, ;) enough
[03:46] <shadeslayer> cool
[03:48] <smartboyhw> Taking lunch now, see ya later
[03:51] <shadeslayer> cya
[04:21] <shadeslayer> ScottK: we didn't get an MRE for KTP?
[04:21] <ScottK> You can go back and look at the tech board discussion.  I may have missed documented the results.
[04:21] <ScottK> The only one they said no on was lightdm-kde.
[04:22] <ScottK> Maybe I forgot to ask.
[04:22] <shadeslayer> I did, and I saw the same thing, I think you forgot to ask because KTP was not in the list 
[04:22] <shadeslayer> ( the list of packages you sent to the tech board _
[04:22] <shadeslayer> )
[04:30] <ScottK> Well there we go.
[04:35] <shadeslayer> " I did not include ktp or choqok only because I wasn't comfortable with it.  Do we know what ktp point releases look like
[04:35] <shadeslayer> hmm
[04:35] <shadeslayer> not sure why I did not respond to that :/
[06:09] <shadeslayer> :/

[06:10] <soee> good morning
[06:10] <shadeslayer> morning soee
[06:29] <soee> hi shadeslayer 
[06:29] <shadeslayer> IIRC someone else was having issues with installing kscreen as well
[06:34] <shadeslayer> oh I know, maybe apt wants to upgrade libkscreen0 to the newest version before installing libkscreen1
[07:05] <soee> shadeslayer, are you using saucy ?
[07:05] <shadeslayer> yes
[07:05] <shadeslayer> but that is on raring
[07:06] <soee> yes but i have one question about saucy
[07:06] <soee> do you have the same that you can in power management set when screen should be turned off etc ? they are not respected at all
[07:07] <soee> so after 15 minut lock screens hows up
[07:08] <shadeslayer> I suspect it's a frakensystemd issue
[07:10] <shadeslayer> gtg for a bit

[07:16] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, Riddell yofel how to put a new status page on qa.kubuntu.org.uk?
[07:26] <shadeslayer> can do
[07:26] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, thank you:)

[08:37] <shadeslayer> uhm
[08:38] <shadeslayer> the phased updates, aren't they bad for large packagesets like KDE ?
[08:41] <yofel> well, could be. Esp. as we are not bug-free at all
[08:41] <yofel> where do the error reports come from actually? whoopsie?
[08:41] <shadeslayer> yes
[08:41] <shadeslayer> my major concern is actually the part where ubuntu users might install KDE and get phased updates
[08:41] <shadeslayer> but then they'll be using XMir
[08:41] <shadeslayer> so not sure how much I care about them
[08:42] <shadeslayer> or someone using update manager on KDE
[08:42] <shadeslayer> which would be weird ...
[08:42] <yofel> what do phased updates have to do with our XMir support issue?
[08:42] <shadeslayer> yofel: just saying that people running XMir are most likely to use the update manager
[08:43] <yofel> on KDE, unlikely IMO
[08:43] <shadeslayer> and since we don't support that configuration anyway ...
[08:45] <yofel> FWIW, 4.10.97 precise runs fine in VBox for me. But I would like it if someone could do an actual openGL test on hardware
[08:45] <yofel> we could do that from the beta ppa though if you want to copy it. (does that actually have enough space?)
[08:46] <yofel> iirc beta still has a 10G quota. I got backports bumped to 24
[08:48] <yofel>     6.9 GiB (68.96%) of 10.0 GiB
[08:48] <yofel> guess I'll have to upload l10n somewhere else
[08:50] <yofel> I'll copy it, we need testers
[08:53] <shadeslayer> ^^
[08:53] <yofel> *sigh*
[08:54] <yofel> I'll be really happy when I don't have to run the precise l10n script anymore
[08:54] <yofel> only 6 more runs left ^^
[08:54]  * shadeslayer is trying to figure out why -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 is not called on Neon5
[08:56] <shadeslayer> funsies
[08:58] <shadeslayer> well that works
[09:24] <debfx> yofel: did you manage to copy all precise packages to the beta ppa? it now says 10.7 of 10.0 GB :)
[09:24] <yofel> debfx: quota only applies to the incoming queue it seems, not to package copies or recipe builds
[09:25] <debfx> aha, interesting :)
[09:29] <shadeslayer> well yeah :D
[09:48] <smartboyhw> Hey yofel

[10:33] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yofel got a lot also
[10:33] <yofel> mostly thanks to all the package uploads really (in the past it was neon, now it's kde sc)

[10:50] <yofel> smartboyhw: ?
[10:52] <smartboyhw> yofel, it appeared in upstream build instructions
[10:53] <smartboyhw> yofel, http://sinny.in/node/25
[10:54] <smartboyhw> That's evidence I think:P
[10:54] <yofel> hm
[10:55] <yofel> and ffmpegthumbs doesn't work?
[10:56] <yofel> in any case, that should be a recommends I think
[10:56] <smartboyhw> yofel, Ok
[10:57] <yofel> don't make packages depend on too much, recommends are installed by default, so unless it's really needed it's not a dep
[10:58] <yofel> plasma-mediacenter-dev is missing a dep on libplasmamediacenter1.1 (= ${binary:Version})
[10:59] <yofel> same for -dbg
[10:59] <yofel> though not really required there as pmc pulls it in

[12:13] <shadeslayer> yofel: thoughts on http://paste.kde.org/pd56cd144/
[12:13] <shadeslayer> yofel: and thoughts on why sudo apt-get install kscreen works
[12:14] <yofel> no, apt's resolver is a magic black box for me, but did you read the discussion with felix yesterday?
[12:15] <shadeslayer> nope
[12:15] <yofel> was some 22h ago
[12:15] <shadeslayer> yeah looking
[12:17] <shadeslayer> there doesn't seem to be a resolution to that
[12:17] <shadeslayer> and frankly I am completely perplexed by this
[12:17] <shadeslayer> everything /seems/ to be fine
[12:18] <shadeslayer> and I only tested with sudo apt-get install kscreen for the SRU and it obviously worked then
[12:21] <yofel> afiestas: hm, you never actually said whether it would be possible to namespace the plugin path with the soversion or not. Would that cause any problems? (That would mean you could have cases where libkscreen0 and libkscreen1 are both installed)
[12:22] <shadeslayer> btw have you ever seen such an issue come up before ??
[12:22] <shadeslayer> and maybe we should file a bug in apt?
[12:34] <yofel> shadeslayer: well, kdevelop in precise backports was stuck on the same thing (kdevplatform5-libs -> kdevplatform7-libs)
[12:35] <yofel> there I fixed it by adding a transitional package, but that's not really something we should do here
[12:35] <yofel> felix had the right idea, question is whether it's implementable
[12:43] <shadeslayer> I see
[12:44] <shadeslayer> still sounds like a bug in apt to me
[13:00] <debfx> yes, could well be a bug in apt. sadly the resolver debug output isn't very helpful in this case.
[13:02] <smartboyhw> Bad apt:P
[13:04] <yofel> it probably is one, but I'm clueless why it happens
[13:04] <yofel> because I can't reproduce that in a chroot
[13:10] <shadeslayer> yofel: you can't? :P
[13:10] <shadeslayer> er
[13:10] <shadeslayer> :O
[13:10] <shadeslayer> on the live CD maybe?
[13:20] <shadeslayer> yep, can be reproduced on the live cd
[13:22] <yofel> ok, now it worked in a chroot too
[13:22] <yofel> but needs apt-get install --install-recommends kubuntu-desktop ubuntu-standard

[15:51] <yofel> then file a bug to make sure it's not forgotten
[15:51] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yofel I agree
[15:52] <shadeslayer> just don't forget to add it back :PO
[15:52] <shadeslayer> make a trello card just in case
[15:53] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, I will:)
[15:54]  * yofel wonders why that boost build-dep is unversioned
[15:55] <yofel> I thought we always used versioned ones
[15:55] <smartboyhw> Do we?
[15:55] <smartboyhw> Anyways
[15:55] <yofel> we did in the past, it seems like some of that was lost in the debian merge
[15:55] <yofel> ScottK: did we have a rationale for that? ^
[15:58] <yofel> hm.......
[15:58] <smartboyhw> ?
[16:00] <yofel> I just remembered what the real issue is
[16:00] <yofel> not boost
[16:00] <yofel> it's avogadro
[16:00] <yofel> (it's *always* avogadro -.-)
[16:00] <smartboyhw> yofel, why?
[16:00] <smartboyhw> -.-
[16:00] <yofel> /usr/lib/avogadro/1_0/AvogadroLibraryDeps.cmake
[16:00] <yofel> has hardcoded lib paths to every lib it's linked against
[16:00] <yofel> SET("avogadro_LIB_DEPENDS" "general;openbabel;general;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtOpenGL.so;general;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so;general;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtNetwo    rk.so;general;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtCore.so;general;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLU.so;general;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so;general;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libX11.so;gen    eral;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXext.so;general;/usr/lib/x86_64-
[16:00] <yofel> linux-gnu/libGLEW.so;general;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so;general;/usr/lib/libboost_python.so;")
[16:00] <yofel> see end
[16:01] <smartboyhw> Oh no
[16:01] <smartboyhw> Stupid avogadro:P
[16:01] <smartboyhw> HOWTO fix?
[16:01] <yofel> ack
[16:01] <yofel> rebuild avogadro usually
[16:01] <yofel> let's see what I can do
[16:01]  * smartboyhw leaves kalzium and avogadro to master yofel 
[16:02] <yofel> you start keeping such things in memory after fixing it half a dozen times
[16:02] <yofel> -.-
[16:02] <smartboyhw> yofel, LOL
[16:02] <smartboyhw> True
[16:04] <yofel> -- Boost Python NOT found - Python support disabled.
[16:04] <yofel> hardly surprising
[16:04] <smartboyhw> yofel, meh
[16:05] <xnox> shadeslayer: i will look. i thought python was left untouched, i could have gone wronng.
[16:05] <smartboyhw> xnox, maybe we have gone wrong:P
[16:06] <smartboyhw> Look above:)
[16:21] <shadeslayer> bah
[16:22] <shadeslayer> I remember the avogadro issue

[23:04] <MichaelP> Wednesday, August 7, 2013: KDE SC 4.11 Final Tag...    August 14, 2013: KDE SC 4.11 Release ..... When does kubuntu get other then beta 2 ?
[23:33] <ScottK> yofel: I don't think there's a reason not to have the versioned boost dep, but I've been mostly avoiding boost stuff in favor of xnox doing it.  BTW, the py27/py33 stuff is from Debian.  Neither xnox nor I did that.
[23:34] <xnox> yofel: which package fails?
[23:34] <xnox> ScottK: i did multiarchification of boost in experimental & synced into saucy. It should all just work, and python was meant to be excluded from multiarchifications.... but there might be bugs.
[23:37] <ScottK> xnox: While you're fixing boost, please make it use dh_python2/3 to generate proper depends and have proper ABI tags on the so files (not the silly py27/py33 stuff)
[23:37] <xnox> ScottK: which dh_python2? i'd want to use dh-python's dh-python2, but that's not merged into ubuntu.
[23:38] <xnox> ScottK: cause i'd get those "for free" with that.
[23:38] <ScottK> You should have dh-python in about a week.
[23:38] <ScottK> So make it work in experimental and then you'll be able to sync it shortly.
[23:39] <ScottK> I've done everything to make it so we can sync python3-defaults/dh-python in bzr, waiting for the current one to migrate to testing.
[23:42] <xnox> ScottK: boost-python.so are not python extension modules, and instead link into your c++ prog to create a python extension module.
[23:42] <xnox> ScottK: so i'm not sure about the renamings.
[23:43] <ScottK> OK
