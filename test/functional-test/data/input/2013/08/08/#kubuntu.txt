[10:10] <BluesKaj> Hi folks
[12:07] <zea> hi, which firewall should i use for kubuntu?
[12:19] <BluesKaj> !fw | zea
[12:20] <BluesKaj> !firewall
[12:20] <ubottu> Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has built-in firewall capabilities. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | GUI frontends such as Gufw also exist. | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo

[12:21] <chachan> hey guys, trying to install 13.04 but my SSD is not being recognize, any test, workaround, tool, etc?
[12:23] <BluesKaj> chachan, is this a new machine with windows 8 ?
[12:23] <chachan> BluesKaj: no, it had 7 and I had kubuntu with a normal HD, just migrating to SSD
[12:24] <BluesKaj> ok , chachan, make sure that your ssd is first in the boot sequence in the bios
[12:25] <chachan> BluesKaj: forgot to mention, I'm running a live session now
[12:26] <chachan> BluesKaj: and I saw the problem when I tried to install and it said me that I have no space for installation
[12:27] <BluesKaj> chachan, did you format the ssd to ext3/4 with a partition manager
[12:27] <chachan> no, I haven't, should I?
[12:28] <chachan> BluesKaj: I thought installer would allow me to make it easier
[12:28] <chachan> I did: (parted) print devices
[12:29] <chachan> and got: Error: Can't have a partition outside the disk!
[12:30] <BluesKaj> chachan, the installer should see the ssd if you format it to ext3/4 first
[12:32] <chachan> ok, that makes sense. Now, trying to look on /dev, parted and fdisk and I don't see the device anywhere
[12:34] <chachan> brb, I had to restart since I disabled AHCI for testing purpose
[12:37] <ziem> how can i stop internet when my vpn (openvpn with network-manager) disconnects?
=== akshay__ is now known as akshay_r
[12:39] <BluesKaj> ziem, if you're torrenting . use vuze , it has that capability , so your real IP isn't displayed
[12:40] <ziem> it's not for torrent but that's good to know thanks
[12:40] <BluesKaj> yeah sure :)
[12:43] <BluesKaj> ziem, are you using commercial vpn servers or is this for work?
[12:43] <ziem> free vpns, not for work
[12:43] <ziem> BluesKaj: there is a trick which consists in only allowing in/out packets for the VPN with a firewall, but it's a bit tedious
[12:45] <chachan> BluesKaj: I'm back
[12:46] <BluesKaj> ziem, ok , I've heard of that but I haven't bothered with it since openvpn on kubuntu doesn't work here , I'm using L2TP /ipsec
[12:47] <ziem> why doesn't openvpn work?
[12:48] <BluesKaj> zie I setup th eips , parameters etc ,. but kvpnc just errors out , everytime
[12:48] <BluesKaj> ziem,
[12:48] <BluesKaj> the IPs
[12:48] <ziem> did you install network-manager-openvpn?
[12:49] <BluesKaj> no I don't use NM
[12:49] <ziem> ah ok
[12:49] <chachan> BluesKaj: the disk should appear in /dev/sdX even if you don't have a partion or format, right?
[12:49] <ziem> i import ovpn files in the gui of network-manager and it works fine
[12:50] <BluesKaj> chachan, yes it should show in /media in dolphin
[12:51] <slatenails> you need to mount it first for it to show there
[12:51] <BluesKaj> yeah i have those openvpn conf files for each server as well
[12:51] <slatenails> #define there /media
[12:51] <chachan> BluesKaj: I have nothing about it :(
[12:51] <BluesKaj> slatenails, root
[12:51] <chachan> I have nothing as /dev/sdX and nothing in dolphin, nothing anywhere
[12:52] <slatenails> what kind of peripheral is this?
[12:52] <BluesKaj> chachan, choose root in dolphin , it should show
[12:52] <slatenails> oh, ssd
[12:52] <chachan> Samsung SSD 840 Series. 120GB
[12:53] <yofel> does it show up in 'dmesg' somewhere?
[12:53] <slatenails> you might want to look into dmesg- -- yea
[12:53] <BluesKaj> chachan, did it show in the bios ?
[12:53] <chachan> I don't see in root
[12:54] <chachan> BluesKaj: no, but I'm not sure if that should appear in the bios
[12:54] <slatenails> if the kernel sees the ssd connecting it should show in dmesg
[12:54] <slatenails> so looking in there should tell you whether it's recognized
[12:54] <BluesKaj> uhm , it should show in the bios , as a drive along with all the others
[12:54] <yofel> look for something like I see here (from kern.log):
[12:54] <yofel>    7 Aug  5 18:01:36 yofel-T510 kernel: [    1.591450] ata1.00: ATA-9: SAMSUNG SSD 830 Series, CXM03B1Q, max UDMA/133
[12:55] <chachan> yofel: where?
[12:55] <yofel> run 'dmesg'
[12:55] <slatenails> chachan, fire up a terminal and run dmesg
[12:55] <chachan> I did, greping and nothing...
[12:55] <yofel> can you pastebin what it prints?
[12:55] <chachan> so, I'm going to open my laptop again and check it out again
[12:56] <chachan> http://dpaste.com/1335585/
[12:57] <yofel> can you grep for ata instead? so we see what's recognised at all
[12:57] <yofel> or just pastebin the whole thing
[12:57] <chachan> http://dpaste.com/1335586/
[12:58]  * yofel would expect it to be connected on ata1, which is empty there
[12:59] <chachan> entire output: http://dpaste.com/1335587/
[13:00] <chachan> ok, let me shutdown and ckeck it physically
[13:01] <chachan> but I must admit that seeing you are running 830 Series give me hopes :)
[13:04] <BluesKaj> don't think he checked the bios to see if it shows up
[13:05] <yofel> I doubt it does
[13:06] <yofel> if the ata port shows up as empty then the disk isn't giving any kind of response, otherwise the kernel would show *something* there
[13:08] <BluesKaj> what is the default format fs on ssds?
[13:09] <yofel> NTFS mostly I think, though when I had to RMA one the replacement was unpartitioned
[13:10] <BluesKaj> ntfs , i bet
[13:10] <BluesKaj> ok
[13:11] <yofel> but I had 2 dead SSDs from OCZ, and none were compeletely DEAD. The first responded with a wrong size and was useless, the other one hung the ATA system up in AHCI, and threw ata errors in IDE mode
[13:11] <slatenails> maybe it's not getting powered up properly
[13:12] <yofel> I would tend to agree
[13:14] <BluesKaj> are ssds using sata connections ? I hope so
[13:15] <yofel> they do
[13:17] <BluesKaj> hmm, I added an esata external drive and it was recognized immediately . but it's not ssd
[13:17] <BluesKaj> older pc here , tho

[13:49] <ziaa> hi everyone, i'm having a firewall problem; i'm trying to only allow connections to and from my vpn; so i set ufw default deny for both incoming and outgoing, and then added four rules (one by one): sudo ufw allow (in|out) (to|from) VPN_IP, but when i do that, i cannot surf anymore. i can ping VPN_IP, but not google.fr; my VPN is connected with network-manager with openvpn
[13:51] <BluesKaj> ziaa, firewall rules can be tricky , especially with vpn , make sure you have the vpn default ports open for tcp and udp
[13:52] <ziaa> BluesKaj: i thought that sudo ufw allow in from VPN_IP was allowing for any port?
[13:53] <BluesKaj> ziaa, I don't think such a rule will open any port unless specified , otherwise why use a fw?
[13:53] <ziaa> BluesKaj: to restrict by IP
[13:54] <BluesKaj> I don't bother with a fw , I use application support ports on my router/modem
[13:55] <BluesKaj> the router already has a fw
[13:58] <ziaa> BluesKaj: from what i understand over there: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW when you allow an IP, it allows every port for that IP
[14:00] <BluesKaj> ziaa, sorry , my knowledge of iptables and ufw is practically nonexistent , since I rely on my router firewall settings.
[14:01] <ziaa> ok np

[19:47] <skrite> hey if i wanted to use kubuntu (like i am) and i want to run openbox, what is an app i can run in openbox that allows me to configure the network like i have in Kubuntu ?
[19:51] <BluesKaj> skrite, are you using networkmanager?
[20:01] <skrite> BluesKaj: yes, the networkmanager that comes with Kubuntu and resides in the tray
[20:03] <BluesKaj> skrite, does openbox use a similar network manager app ? I'm just thinking how one would transfer the network settings whatever they might be.
[20:05] <skrite> yeah, i don't think that it does, i used to just not use the network manager and did everything from the /etc/network/interfaces, but that was before i bought a usb wireless adapter.
[20:06] <skrite> i suppose i could try installing the gtk version of the nm-applet or network manager like they have in xubuntu.
[20:06] <skrite> then use it when in openbox and use the networkmanager in KDE
[20:10] <BluesKaj> unless you require wireless settings , you can run your network ethernet on any winow manager or desktop from  /etc/network/interfaces , like so : http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/setting-up-an-network-interfaces-file/
[20:10] <BluesKaj> skrite, ^
[20:11] <BluesKaj> without and need for a network manager , which you can remove from your OS
