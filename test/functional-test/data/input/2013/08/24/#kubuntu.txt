[09:04] <igor__> Hi to all
[09:05] <igor__> does anyboy use dbmail 3.1.2?
[09:12] <igor__> I have a problem with encoding. For example, when I try to get subject of message and the field has cyrillic I get "????????" instead readable string. I use mysql database. Mysql default character set is utf8 and collation utf8_general_ci. Default system character set is utf8 too. In the dbmail.conf parameter encoding is utf8. All data in the database has correct ecnoding and data is readable. Maybe anybody know what is the problem?

[17:05] <lordievader> Good evening.
[17:07] <StarfighterPilot> lordievader: hi

[17:08] <StarfighterPilot> fine lordievader, and you?
[17:09] <lordievader> Doing good too :)
[17:22] <viteac> guys what keyboard combination is to KILL KDE? I want to relogin when k freeze.
[17:22] <viteac> KUBUNTU13.04
[17:23] <mwabc> ctrl+alt+backspace
[17:24] <lordievader> viteac: If it is enabled, then ctrl+alt+backspace. You can enable it by running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration".
[17:26] <viteac> lordievader:  this version is so different, to many changes.
[17:28] <lordievader> Forgot when they disabled that shortcut, did came in handy at times :)
[17:28] <viteac> anyway 13.04 is not so good, I've noticed crashing
[17:30] <viteac> lordievader: I rather don't remeba the names, but 8 probably but 10 some other combination I think ctrl+alt+shift+k
[17:30] <lordievader> viteac: That really is too bad to hear, here it has been running rock solid. Just like 13.10 actually.
[17:32] <BluesKaj> no 13.04 crashes here , but I keep it up to date dist-wise and kde-wise 
[17:32] <lordievader> Same here.
[17:36] <yofel> viteac: sysrq+k is there too, but nowadays disabled for security reasons (by /etc/sysctl.d/10-magic-sysrq.conf)
