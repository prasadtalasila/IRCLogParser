[11:28] <lordievader> Good afternoon.
[12:15] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[12:39]  * smartboyhw goes for some website update work for 12.04.3
=== smartboyhw changed the topic of #kubuntu-devel to: Kubuntu - Friendly Computing | https://trello.com/kubuntu | https://notes.kde.org/p/kubuntu-ninjas 4.11.0 saucy/archive raring/backports precise/ninjas| 13.10 Alpha 2 and 12.04.3 released | 13.10 milestoned bugs tagged Kubuntu http://goo.gl/vHRjj
[12:48] <smartboyhw> DONE
[12:50] <smartboyhw> yofel, can you give me your pbuilderrc that you pasted yesterday? The link expired
[12:51] <yofel> smartboyhw: http://paste.kde.org/pc9359ab0
[12:52] <smartboyhw> yofel,  Can't branch? #Get our magical hook: bzr branch lp:~kubuntu-members/pbuilder/pbuilder-hooks
[12:53] <yofel> oh, that was re-owned
[12:53] <yofel> ~kubuntu-packagers/pbuilder/pbuilder-hooks
[12:53] <yofel> please update the wiki page if you have time
[14:02] <debfx> yofel: what do you think about dropping kubuntu_38_revert_fix_jit_crash.diff in qt4-x11/raring? I have a reported case where it seems to randomly crash plasma-desktop from time to time.
[14:05] <yofel> debfx: that's the one that's removed in saucy, right? If yes then that should be done indeed
[14:05]  * yofel totally forgot about it -.-
[14:05] <debfx> yes
[14:07] <debfx> ok, I'll prepare a version for raring-proposed
[14:16] <debfx> I wonder what to put in Regression Potential ^^

[15:05] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1200523 in KDE Base Workspace "Some of the kubuntu patches break plasma" [High,Confirmed]
[15:57] <debfx> ScottK: there is a qt upload in the raring-proposed queue for your reviewing pleasure :)
[15:59] <ScottK> debfx: Needs test case, etc in the bug.
[16:00] <debfx> ScottK: it's not enough what I added?
[16:01]  * ScottK looks again.
[16:02] <ScottK> Also, can you look at the status of Bug #1180067.  We had it fixed in raring once, but had to revert it and it was fixed differently in saucy.
[16:02] <ubottu> bug 1180067 in qt4-x11 (Ubuntu Raring) "No icons on buttons" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1180067
[16:02] <ScottK> Yes.  It's fine.
[16:03]  * debfx has had bad experience with including multiple fixes in a SRU
[16:03] <ScottK> OK.
[16:07] <ScottK> debfx: Accepted.
[16:07] <debfx> thanks
[16:07] <ScottK> It would be nice to do the other one after this one.
[16:08] <soee> what is the predicted year/date for first releases of KDE 5 ?
[16:08] <smartboyhw> soee, you mean, KF5?
[16:08] <smartboyhw> And first of all, there is no KDE 4
[16:08] <smartboyhw> or KDE5
[16:08] <soee> smartboyhw, yes 
[16:09] <smartboyhw> Since KDE is a community:P
[16:09] <smartboyhw> soee, expect Q1/2014
[16:09] <ScottK> Which is nonsense.
[16:09] <soee> smartboyhw, oh you, you know what i mean :D
[16:09] <smartboyhw> soee, LOL

[16:09] <ScottK> If one wanted proper grammar, it's be KDE's SC anyway, not KDE SC.
[16:10] <smartboyhw> ScottK, uh, I think nobody called it KDE's SC
[16:10] <soee> i always call it just KDE :)
[16:10] <smartboyhw> soee, unacceptable:P
[16:10] <ScottK> That's correct, but if it was really a software collection made by the KDE community, that'd be the way to say it.
[16:11] <smartboyhw> ScottK, which soee is talking about;P
[16:11] <ScottK> Right.  The whole rebranding nonsense was just a pointless distraction that is still causing confusion.
[16:43] <shadeslayer> ScottK: I'm still waiting on KDE Telepathy :(
[17:05] <lordievader> Good evening.
[21:05] <markey> guys it looks like KDE 4.11 was backported to Kubuntu 12.10, but Amarok 2.8 wasn't
[21:05] <markey> so that won't work. Amarok 2.7.1 crashes with KDE 4.11
[21:34] <yofel> uh, that was on someone's todo list o.O
[21:35] <yofel> but it's indeed missing
