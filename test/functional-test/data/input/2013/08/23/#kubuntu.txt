[06:13] <galoise> hello peoples! iḿ configuring a new system here, and iḿ apalled to discover that the icedtea plugin depends on half of gnome! is there a less gtk'ed alternative for kde users that iḿ missing?
[06:14] <valorie> what does icetea do?
[06:15] <valorie> and plugin for what?
[06:15] <galoise> oh. pardon. icedtea-7-plugin
[06:16] <galoise> is needed, i understand, to get java in chrome and stuff?
[06:16] <valorie> ah
[06:16] <valorie> hmmm
[06:16] <galoise> mmm, now that you mention it, maybe i'm too old to realize that it is not needed anymore :S
[06:16] <valorie> chrome/chromium aren't KDE at all
[06:17] <valorie> nor unity, for that matter.....
[06:17] <galoise> well, i tried to get rekonq to install a plugin for me, but it silently didn't run it
[06:17] <galoise> nevermind, maybe the idea that it is required is some kinda of flash from the 90's :S
[06:17] <galoise> i only really use it for one site, and there seems to be a native alternative...
[06:18] <valorie> cool
[06:18]  * valorie uses chromium, and has no such plugin
[06:22] <galoise> hey, it used to be all the rage in the pre-flash era... :P
[06:23] <valorie> well, back then I used FF too
[06:23] <valorie> :-)
[06:35] <galoise> back then i used nestcape navigator :D
[06:35] <galoise> back then i used nestcape navigator :D
[06:36] <valorie> sure
[06:36] <valorie> I was using Fidonet before browsers
[06:36] <valorie> :-)
[06:37] <valorie> before I heard of "the internet"

[08:46] <ovidiu-florin> Hello world. Do you know why I like Kubuntu 13.04? Because I was born in 13th of april :P
[08:46] <valorie> nice!
[08:47] <smartboyhw> ovidiu-florin, :O
[08:47] <smartboyhw> But, 13.04 wasn't released AT 13th April
[08:47] <smartboyhw> And as far as I can tell, 13.04 is unlucky (first number in Western terms, second number in Chinese terms)
[08:47] <smartboyhw> :P
[08:47] <ovidiu-florin> it's the name 13.04 I was born in 13.04 (european format)
[08:48] <smartboyhw> ovidiu-florin, 13.04 was released on 28th April I think, to cheer you up:P
[08:48] <smartboyhw> !13.04
[08:48] <ubottu> Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) is the current release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/13.04/ - Release notes: http://ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/13.04
[08:50] <ovidiu-florin> On the 13.04 instaler, the progressbar color does not work with the rest of the theme
[08:50] <valorie> I like it because it gives me very little trouble
[08:50] <ovidiu-florin> it should really be changed
[08:50] <valorie> I agree
[08:50] <valorie> I think apachelogger is dealing with that
[08:51] <valorie> well, for 13.10
[08:51] <valorie> you could file a bug for 13.04, but unknown if there is interest in fixing it at this date
[08:51] <apachelogger> wouldn't get fixed
[08:52] <ovidiu-florin> why not?
[08:53] <valorie> this isn't an LTS, ovidiu-florin
=== jbracker is now known as Guest6670
[08:53] <valorie> there are only a couple of months until 13.10
[08:53] <ovidiu-florin> so no fix, ever? at least a fix for 13.01
[08:53] <ovidiu-florin> 13.10*
[08:54] <valorie> like I said, apachelogger is looking at that
[08:54] <ovidiu-florin> oh, ok
[08:54] <ovidiu-florin> :D
[08:54] <smartboyhw> ovidiu-florin, a fix for 13.10
[08:54] <smartboyhw> No fix for 13.04, sorry
[08:54] <ovidiu-florin> it's ok
[08:56] <valorie> we can always use more folks helping out!
[08:56] <ovidiu-florin> Is there a script or a program or a way to make my own custom iso of kubuntu, or any other way I can change the default settings on Kubuntu? so that when I install it I wouldn't have to fiddle with it for about an hour to customise it?
[08:56] <valorie> which means moar fixes.....

[08:59] <ovidiu-florin> so this practically means that I'll make my own distribution?
[08:59] <ovidiu-florin> I don't really want that.
[08:59] <valorie> depending on how you define 'distribution'
[08:59] <ovidiu-florin> I just need a simple and fast way to customize kubuntu and KDE
[09:00] <ovidiu-florin> I had a basic script for this, but that's just for the Ubuntu backend.
[09:00] <valorie> that page covers all kinds of stuff
[09:00] <valorie> lots of people want to do what you do
[09:01] <valorie> for instance, for server installs
[09:01] <valorie> etc.
[09:01] <valorie> sec
[09:06] <ovidiu-florin> this is what I have so far: https://github.com/ovidiub13/kubcus
[09:07] <ovidiu-florin> I haven't used it in some time.
[09:22] <premput> i need some help pretty badly
[09:23] <premput> i stupidly removed my .kde folder (it was named .kde-bak, i had planned to mv it back to .kde but rm'ed instead)
[09:23] <valorie> :(
[09:23] <premput> so i lost my kwallet file and entries
[09:24] <valorie> so you have no backup?
[09:24] <premput> which had the passwords to all my accounts.
[09:24] <premput> no, i didnt keep a backup
[09:24] <valorie> my sympathy
[09:25] <valorie> if you have a backup of your entire system, might you find a slightly older copy?
[09:25] <valorie> or of your home
[09:25] <premput> no, i dont have any backups.
[09:25] <premput> is there any way to get it back?  right after i removed it i hard rebooted so it wouldn't get written to the ext4 journel.
[09:26] <valorie> that is beyond what I know, sorry
[09:26] <premput> and i haven't mounted my harddrive (aside from read-only) since then (a few days ago).  right now im using a lubuntu live cd
[09:26] <premput> oh
[09:26] <ovidiu-florin> premput: you could try some data recovery software?
[09:27]  * valorie goes to bed
[09:27] <valorie> best of luck, premput
[09:27] <premput> ovidiu-florin: right now im dcfldd'ing /dev/sda to an external harddrive so i can (hopefully) see if it's even still in there
[09:27] <ovidiu-florin> oh
[09:27] <premput> but i dont really know how to use photorec to recover a kwallet file, hopefully this wont be too hard

[09:46] <ovidiu-florin> ;)
[09:46] <lordievader> Hey ovidiu-florin, how are you?
[09:47] <ovidiu-florin> at work. I've switched to arch linux. 
[09:47] <ovidiu-florin> But I'm still giving kubuntu to all my friends and family.
[09:48] <izanagi> they dont cry: where is my windows?
[09:48] <lordievader> izanagi: Could you give a bit more background info?
[09:49] <ovidiu-florin> izanagi: they cry that they can't stand windows anymore and they ask me to give them linux
[09:50] <ovidiu-florin> My brother does the same
[09:50] <izanagi> strange
[09:50] <ovidiu-florin> :d
[09:50] <ovidiu-florin> :D
[09:51] <izanagi> i install linux on friends or family comuters, when antivirus license is over, or windows is lagging
[09:51] <lordievader> Ugh, it seems I ain't awake yet..
[09:51] <izanagi> you dont need to use av in ubuntu. "WOOOOOOW"
[09:51] <ovidiu-florin> so far about 8 people use exclusively Linux because of me, and many others use it in dualboot
[09:52] <izanagi> and "wooooow, it is much faster than windows and its free.  amazing"
[09:52] <ovidiu-florin> only one problem
[09:52] <izanagi> even my grandpa use ubuntu now :)
[09:52] <ovidiu-florin> the default KDE settings in Kubuntu don't work well on older computers
[09:52] <lordievader> Anyhow could you guys continue this conversation in #kubuntu-offtopic?
[09:52] <izanagi> yes
[09:52] <ovidiu-florin> NO UBUNTU!! KUBUNTU !!!
[09:53] <izanagi> shift, alt, f12
[09:53] <ovidiu-florin> izanagi: for this session
[09:54] <izanagi> deafault setting restore session after boot? :)
[09:54] <ovidiu-florin> anyhow, IMO the default settings should be generated by hardware detection
[09:54] <izanagi> if you cant change KDE setting, you cant install kubuntu
[09:54] <lordievader> !ot
[09:54] <ubottu> #kubuntu is the official Kubuntu support channel, for all Kubuntu-related support questions. Please use #kubuntu-offtopic for general chatter. Thanks!

[10:33] <BluesKaj> Howdy folks
[10:36] <izanagi_> hi
[10:36] <Tm_T> izanagi_: to force disk check on next boot, you can do the following command: "sudo touch /forcefsck" that creates forcefsck file which is read on boot
[10:37] <ovidiu-florin> does kubuntu use systemd ?
[10:37] <izanagi_> just that?
[10:37] <ovidiu-florin> the latest, I mean
[10:38] <Tm_T> izanagi_: yes, just that
[10:38] <Tm_T> izanagi_: and on next boot, the check is forced
[10:38] <izanagi_> Tm_T: thanks
[10:38] <Tm_T> izanagi_: no systemd at all AFAIK
[10:39] <ovidiu-florin> Tm_T: get some coffe
[10:39] <izanagi_> this file is deleted after boot, or i have to do it manually?
[10:39] <ovidiu-florin> izanagi_: do a ls -lah / after first boot
[10:40] <BluesKaj> ovidiu-florin, there are some parts of sytemd being used in 13.10 afaik
[10:40] <izanagi_> what -lah do?
[10:40] <ovidiu-florin> actually -lah is not necessary
[10:41] <ovidiu-florin> BluesKaj: "some" parts?
[10:41] <ovidiu-florin> how do you implement systemd partially?
[10:41] <BluesKaj> yeah , I've heard it being discussed , but I don't know the details
[10:42] <ovidiu-florin> I have systemd in arch and ... OMG you should see it boot and shutdown
[10:42] <ovidiu-florin> blink and you'll miss it
[10:42] <BluesKaj> ovidiu-florin, good question , maybe you could ask in #kubuntu-devel
[10:42] <Tm_T> izanagi_: yes the file is empty file and it will be gone after check
[10:43] <Tm_T> ovidiu-florin: coffee is good suggestion (;
[10:43] <izanagi_> good to know, thanks Tm_T

[12:05] <somekool> hi there, anyone else got logout/reboot issue? simply does not work for me... 
[12:06] <somekool> I've been doing (sudo reboot) lately
[12:07] <izanagi> check /var/log/syslog
[12:10] <somekool> izanagi: i got lircd spamming in there, other than that, nothing
[12:10] <izanagi> well, im not familiar with that, i just use log and then use google :)
[12:12] <somekool> ok
[12:12] <somekool> I was simply wondering if it was a common recent issue that other kubuntu users are experiencing..
[12:13] <BluesKaj> somekool, some have complained about your issue , but we haven't seen a fix yet 
[12:13] <izanagi> i had this problem. The last resort is to delete .kde folder
[12:14] <BluesKaj> don't think that works in this case 
[12:14] <monkeyjuice> is this 13.04 somekool
[12:14] <somekool> yes 13.04
[12:16] <monkeyjuice> there is an old bug report a few months back like this  
[12:16] <BluesKaj> somekool, did you just upgrade KDE ?
[12:17] <somekool> I'mpretty sure I rebooted since I have
[12:17] <somekool> I was running 4.10.97 before
[12:20] <BluesKaj> can't hurt to reboot , to make sure
[12:20] <izanagi> btw, i have problem with wifi card. I cant turn it off(led on netbook is on). It was working in older *ubuntu. There is nothing in google, everyone have problems with turning wifi on, not off :)
[12:26] <somekool> yep I'll do that. and troubleshoot more if it happens again
[12:42] <izanagi> do you know how can i fast format usb drive?
[12:47] <izanagi> because i cant delete files, it says that trash is full, but it is not
[12:48] <izanagi> ok, used rm
[12:55] <BluesKaj> izanagi, i use the the partition editor in kmenu>system to format USB sticks , NTFS seems to work best
[12:56] <izanagi> i dont works for me. Unounted drive, selected format, received errors. Nevermind, used just rm to remove all files, it is enough
[12:58] <BluesKaj> izanagi, just choose new , then format apply

[16:11] <lordievader> Hey Galaga 
[16:11] <lordievader> How are you?
[16:12] <Galaga> Hi, pretty good.
[16:12] <Galaga> Kubuntu is kicking my ass.
[16:13] <Galaga> 12.04 install give me nvidia driver problems and 13.4 install boots to a black screen.
[16:13] <lordievader> Galaga: Could you still get into a tty in the 13.04 install?
[16:14] <Galaga> No, it boots for about 5 min. and all I get is a black screen
[16:16] <lordievader> Galaga: In the 12.04 install what drivers did the jockey offer?
[16:19] <Galaga> I get this error:  Error: Could not find any typelib for AppIndicator3
[16:20] <lordievader> Galaga: Everyone gets that ;)
[16:20] <Galaga> yeah, and I tried all the trick I could find and they all fail.
[16:21] <lordievader> What card are you running?
[16:21] <Galaga> Are their any current distros with include good nvidia drivers?
[16:21] <Galaga> I thinks is a GTS850 or GTS8500
[16:22] <Galaga> Its about 4 years old.
[16:22] <Galaga> I think GTS 850

[19:34] <littlegirl> [sigh]
[19:35] <shadeslayer> littlegirl: ssup
[19:35] <shadeslayer> not a expert, might be able to help
[19:36] <shadeslayer> littlegirl: just highlight with the question
[19:37] <littlegirl> shadeslayer: Thanks! I'm writing a guide page for Kubuntu and it's about static IPs. I'd like it to be accurate, and I can't find this information with an ordinary Google search (yet). Can more than one class of network coexist on a LAN, and would it be a bad or good idea to do so if it is possible?
[19:37] <shadeslayer> 'class of network' ?
[19:39] <shadeslayer> littlegirl: ^^
[19:40] <littlegirl> shadeslayer: Look in section 3 of http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918 or do a search for "class" on that page.
[19:40] <shadeslayer> aha that
[19:40] <shadeslayer> I don't see why not
[19:40] <littlegirl> shadeslayer: Basically, what I'm trying to find out is whether it's possible to have an IP that begins with 10 and another that begins with 192 within the same LAN, and whether that's something anyone even would do and whether it would be a bad idea to even contemplate it. (:
[19:41] <shadeslayer> You could have something like : class A network which has a router that connects to another router that might assign class C IP addresses
[19:41] <shadeslayer> then the routers just do NAT translations at the router level to forward and recieve packets
[19:41] <littlegirl> shadeslayer: Would it have to be on another router, or could one router handle both?
[19:42] <shadeslayer> AFAIK 2 routers
[19:42] <shadeslayer> I don't think you can assign a Class A ip address and Class C IP address via the same router
[19:42] <shadeslayer> ^^ atleast on consumer grade routers
[19:42] <littlegirl> That's the million dollar question, and so far Google hasn't answered it. Since it's a Kubuntu guide I'm writing, I figured I'd ask in here. (:
[19:43] <shadeslayer> AFAIK can't be done
[19:43] <shadeslayer> yofel: ^^ do you think this can be done? ( Class A and Class C IP addresses assigned by the same router )
[19:44] <littlegirl> Thanks. I'll keep hunting, though, until I can find out definitively. (:
[19:44]  * yofel reads
[19:44] <littlegirl> I'll try ##networking again to see if I got any nibbles if it's a stumper for yofel. (:
[19:48] <yofel> uhm, just to be accurate, a router never *assignes* IP's, it's the DHCP server that does that, and I don't know enough about DHCP server configuration there.
[19:48] <yofel> The general rule is that networks may NEVER overlap, so 192.168.0.0/16 and 192.168.1.0/24 in the same network will NOT work, on the other hand 172.16.0.0/16 and 172.18.0.0/16 will be fine
[19:48] <yofel> the first example would require a NAT
[19:48] <yofel> *require NAT
[19:49] <yofel> littlegirl: and to talk about classful network, 172.16.0.0/16 + 192.168.1.0/24 in the same physical network is fine
[19:51] <littlegirl> yofel: Thanks! This is for a guide on assigning static IPs, and although I'm not going to recommend or figure out how it would be done, I like to mention that something can be done if it can, so it's good to know. (:
[19:52]  * littlegirl is of the opinion that there are far too many Ubuntu guides and not nearly enough Kubuntu guides out and about on the internet, and hopes to correct that.
[20:00] <BluesKaj> littlegirl, well google is to blame for a lot of that , they just assume kubuntu and ubuntu searches will give results that can be applied to both 
[20:06] <littlegirl> BluesKaj: Yep. Hopefully some of my stuff will avoid that. (:
[20:08] <BluesKaj> littlegirl, fortunately network settings without network manager can be setup the same on both kubuntu and ubuntu 
[20:10] <BluesKaj> ok , more stuff to do ...BBL
[20:10] <littlegirl> BluesKaj: Yeah, I just like to have Kubuntu mentioned in the page so that Google searches turn it up specifically, and I make my commands Kubuntu-specific (kdesudo instead of gksudo, etc.).
[20:10] <littlegirl> OK
