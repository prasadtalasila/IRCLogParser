[00:03] <sarnold> smoser: we -eventually- expect to have some environment variable scrubbing thing in apparmor, that might get you a lot of the way there
[00:03] <sarnold> smoser: but sooner might be to patch upstart to do that :)
[00:09] <smoser> upstart is fine.
[00:09] <smoser> "fine" in some sense.
[00:09] <smoser> it cannot be polluted in this way
[00:09] <smoser> because upstart jobs dont' inherit the caller's environment.
[00:09] <smoser> sysvinit do
[00:11] <maxb> I guess /usr/sbin/invoke-rc.d could be the place to do this?
[00:11] <sarnold> oh, right, you even said as much. sigh :)
[00:15] <smoser> sarnold, well, its both a feature and a bug for upstart honestly.
[00:15] <smoser> there is a use case where you would *want* to affect LD_PRELOAD, and to my knowledge you cannot (easily)

[08:31] <pitti> Laney: thanks!
[08:33] <debfx> Whoopie: no, it's an oversight. someone needs to test if it really works though.
[08:34] <Whoopie> debfx: if you put it in a new package, I'll test. ;-)

[09:00] <Noskcaj> cjwatson, Can you merge hw-detect before we hit feature freeze? There aren't any major changes, so it should be fairly easy
[09:05] <xnox> Noskcaj: you are after translation updates?
[09:06] <Noskcaj> xnox, I wouldn't use them, but that and your improvements would be worth doing
[09:08] <xnox> Noskcaj: right. ok. cjwatson is away atm. but we should merge up all d-i packages to gain translations et. al.
[09:08] <Noskcaj> ok, thanks for the info
[09:25] <jamespage> jodh, I'm right in thinking I can't write custom actions for upstart configurations right?
[09:26] <jamespage> I have 'openvswitch-switch start' and 'openvswitch-switch stop' etc..
[09:26] <jamespage> but I'm guessing openvswitch-switch force-reload-kmod is a non starter
[09:28] <jodh> jamespage: yes, you are correct (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Upstart/Ideas). But you could of course just create a specific job for that.
[09:28] <jamespage> jodh, yeah - I was thinking about doing that
[09:28] <jamespage> openvswitch-switch-force-reload
[09:29] <jamespage> openvswitch-force-reload-kmod
[09:29] <jodh> jamespage: why is a kernel module reload required? can't that happen in the pre-start for the job?
[09:29] <jamespage> jodh, it interrupts the dataflows in the kernel so you don't always want todo it when restarting the daemons
[09:29] <jamespage> i.e. it breaks the networking...
[09:29] <jodh> jamespage: fun :)
[09:35] <jamespage> jodh, yeah - but hey!

[09:36] <Laney> pitti: is openvswitch's autopkgtest genuinely stuck?
[09:37] <pitti> Laney: yes; it used to work against older kernels, but it hangs with kernel 3.11

=== freeflying_away is now known as freeflying
[10:21] <xnox> jodh: don't think it will help much, amd64 is busy building firefox, thunderbird, yade which all take a while. And bumping your priority will not kick those builds off.
[10:22] <xnox> jodh: looking at https://launchpad.net/builders the queue is very small (PPA build status on the right)
=== gusch is now known as gusch|lunch
[10:49] <xnox> jodh: looks like nonvirt build hang all of builders, possible cause is stray child process left over.
[10:49] <xnox> jodh: infinity was reporting that before.
[10:53] <jodh> xnox: ok, I'll see if I can recreate locally.
[10:53] <xnox> jodh: i'm grepping my irc logs.... it was one of the tests that did a fork.
[10:56] <xnox> jodh: found it, test_job and forked test_job are left after the build is finished.

[11:00] <pete-woods> didrocks: hi! I have another project I'd like to to start landing in distro (https://launchpad.net/unity-voice) - it's not in jenkins yet (waiting for fginther's tz), but thought there may be some benefit letting you know, seen as feature freeze is next week!
[11:02] <jodh> xnox: I'm now also seeing test_initctl's left around. I think it's your reload test - it's only killing the paused child in the error code path.
[11:02] <jodh> xnox: could you take a look?
[11:02] <xnox> jodh: correct.
[11:03] <xnox> jodh: i'll take test_initctl.
[11:03] <jodh> ack. I'll dig into the other one...
[11:07] <xnox> jodh: there is something different on the current build... https://pastebin.canonical.com/96297/
[11:08] <jodh> xnox: ? you mean the addition of the test_dbus-daemon? I'm also seeing that locally.
[11:09] <xnox> ok, cool.

[11:39] <didrocks> pete-woods: hey! is it a service/a library? who will consume it?
[11:40] <didrocks> pete-woods: also, are there integration tests? Seeing a lot of new projects, not a lot of integration tests :)
[11:48] <pete-woods> didrocks: it's a service, and it's basically the voice code from HUD, ripped out
[11:50] <pete-woods> and to be fair, the stuff I've made is either test libraries (libqt*test) or hasn't been integrated with the shell yet :)
[11:50] <ScottK> pitti: If you can give me the hint to copy/paste, I'll be glad to do it, but I'm a bit tied up with $STUFF to work out the details.
[11:50] <pete-woods> the consumer will be HUD
[11:51] <pitti> ScottK: no worries, Laney already did it; thank!
[11:51] <pitti> s
=== gusch|lunch is now known as gusch
[11:51] <ScottK> OK.  Great.
[11:51] <didrocks> pete-woods: ok, part of the HUD delivery then?
[11:52] <didrocks> pete-woods: managed by the same team anyway I guess
[11:52] <pete-woods> didrocks: well it's managed by me, really, basically HUD is leaky, and the voice code is memory heavy, so we can't let HUD leak instances of it
[11:53] <didrocks> pete-woods: ok, sounds good :)
[11:53] <didrocks> pete-woods: I assigned it to robru FYI
[11:53] <pete-woods> didrocks: I ported it to C++ and have 95% test coverage with it
[11:53] <pete-woods> the difficulty with integration tests is
[11:53] <pete-woods> it takes microphone input
[11:53] <pete-woods> didrocks: the unit tests add the pulse "pipe" device for a fake microphone
[11:54] <pete-woods> can autopilot do a similar sort of thing?
[11:54] <didrocks> pete-woods: so, it's some kind of integration tests, right?
[11:54] <didrocks> if you are using pulse to input some infos
[11:54] <pete-woods> didrocks: I would call the tests I've written integration tests
[11:54] <pete-woods> they treat the service as a whole binary
[11:54] <pete-woods> rather that testing components
[11:54] <didrocks> pete-woods: from what I know, autopilot is just a glorified unittest class with stuff to pilot touch and mouse move
[11:55] <didrocks> pete-woods: so, you can call your "fake input microphone"
[11:55] <didrocks> and read the result from the HUD
[11:55] <didrocks> (just to ensure that the HUD understand your input/output)
[11:55] <pete-woods> that makes sense
[11:55] <pete-woods> where do autopilot test go, by the way?
[11:56] <didrocks> most of the time, we keep them in the same source
[11:56] <didrocks> look at unity8 for instance, a C++/QML example with the autopilot tests
[11:56] <pete-woods> so these tests should probably go in the HUD source?
[11:56] <didrocks> pete-woods: either HUD or this one, what you think will make more sense IHMO
[11:57] <pete-woods> okay, will look at that
[11:57] <didrocks> pete-woods: it's just about ensuring the 2 can communicate together I guess
[11:57] <didrocks> thanks!
[11:57] <pete-woods> I can't promise anything here, didrocks, I've tried getting these tests running on the build farm before
[11:57] <didrocks> pete-woods: I'll be on holidays starting tonight for 2 weeks, please check with robru then (I've assigned to him in the spreadsheet)
[11:57] <pete-woods> didrocks: pulse modules don't seem to want to load on the build server
[11:58] <pete-woods> you'll note a rather embarassing (ENABLE_TESTS=OFF) in the rules
[11:58] <didrocks> pete-woods: yeah, for autopilot, that will be a real session
[11:58] <pete-woods> cool
[11:58] <pete-woods> that sounds excellent
[11:58] <didrocks> so you shouldn't get the same issue than in the builder chroot
[11:58] <pete-woods> didrocks: thanks for all the infos! :)
[11:59] <didrocks> yw ;)

[12:34] <Whoopie> debfx: Here is the debdiff for virtualbox to add the VNC plugin module: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6017538/
[12:34] <Whoopie> debfx: to enable VNC, I followed this guide: http://www.neant.ro/2013/04/enable-vnc-on-virtualbox-ose-4-2/
[12:35] <Whoopie> debfx: the VBOX_VERSION_STRING_RAW change was needed as the version must be 4.2.16 and not 4.2.16_Ubuntu, otherwise the module fails to be loaded (seen with "VBoxManage list extpacks").
[12:36] <sforshee> pitti: thanks for taking care of my upower patches! Are you planning to update the saucy package with your changes?
[12:37] <pitti> sforshee: at some point, yes; once hughsie is back online, I want to get him review my third patch, then upload a new snapshot to Debian, and sync it over
[12:37] <pitti> sforshee: but I guess it's not that urgent as the saucy package now has all those
[12:39] <sforshee> pitti: not urgent. I want to test the patches you comitted, but if you were going to upload them soon I figured I'd just wait.
=== _salem is now known as salem_
[12:46] <smoser> xnox, there is about an order of magnitude difference between eatmydata and force unsafe io
[12:46] <smoser> on slow disk.
[12:47] <xnox> smoser: true. better than nothing, though.
[12:48] <diwic> is there a way to specify something *optional* in an debian/package.install file? I have a file that's only being built under one arch,
[12:48] <diwic> and for that arch it should be included, and just left out on the others.
[12:48] <ogra_> wasnt there an option to specify an arch specific install file ?
[12:48] <diwic> now the other arches FTBFS because they can't find the file which is not built
[12:49] <diwic> ogra_, I don't know, do you know how?
[12:49] <ogra_> not really ... the dh_install manpage doesnt say much
[12:50] <ogra_> i think it was something like .install.$arch but not sure i remember right
[12:52] <Ampelbein> diwic: Yes, it's described in man 7 debhelper, http://paste.ubuntu.com/6017598/
[12:54] <diwic> Ampelbein, ah, thanks. ogra's right then

[14:03] <zequence> From what I understand, they've both been thoroughly reviewed, so they should check out
[14:04] <xnox> zequence: it would be nice for Len to add his email to launchpad account, to get proper committer links to launchpad profile.
[14:04] <OvenWerks> xnox: I thought it was there
[14:05] <smartboyhw> OvenWerks: I think you never ran bzr launchpad-login
[14:05] <xnox> OvenWerks: https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntustudio-dev/ubuntustudio/ubuntustudio-installer has "Len Ovens len@ovenwerks.net" is that email added as one of the emails in your profile?
[14:05] <OvenWerks> It is the only one.
[14:06] <OvenWerks> It has a lock beside it though.
[14:06] <OvenWerks> does that mean it doesn't work?
[14:07] <xnox> OvenWerks: then I don't know =) maybe try #launchpad.  Cause e.g. look how each person is "linkifyied" down here: https://code.launchpad.net/~xnox/ubuntu-seeds/fix-kernels-precise-kubuntu and allows one to click on a person.
[14:08] <OvenWerks> Ya, I have wondered what happended, it used to work
[14:08] <xnox> OvenWerks: zequence: is that -installer package going to stay in perl / zenity / apt-get? I would have thought packagekit UI should be available to install packages, and/or select them.
[14:08] <xnox> OvenWerks: zequence: also as a side note, zenity usually runs at 100% CPU for no reason, spinning/waiting for user input.
[14:09] <OvenWerks> xnox: I am looking for something that is already in all the DEs/flavours
[14:09] <xnox> OvenWerks: zequence: if you are happy with that, then why not =)
[14:09] <OvenWerks> We need to have it in before FF it will continue in active development after though...
[14:09] <xnox> OvenWerks: packagekit API/UI _should_ be available. On ubuntu it would spin up software-center UI, on kubuntu their package store, etc....
[14:10] <xnox> OvenWerks: ok. that's fine.
[14:10] <xnox> OvenWerks: zequence: do you have matching seed update as well to go along with those two?
[14:10] <OvenWerks> That is next :)
[14:11] <OvenWerks> I didn't want to break -setting if these two didn't make it.
