[05:46] <smartboyhw> Riddell, I'm currently fixing Noskcaj's problem here
[05:46]  * smartboyhw blames Noskcaj for not test-building
[05:46] <smartboyhw> And using Xubuntu is NOT an excuse (when you can actually run it under Xubuntu)
[05:58] <smartboyhw> Riddell, shadeslayer: Can you explain why we use telepathy-farstream 0.4?
[05:58] <smartboyhw> I mean, for ktp-call-ui
[05:58] <smartboyhw> It builds with 0.6
[05:59] <smartboyhw> maybe I should ask Noskcaj later, he made that
[06:00] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, why is there a telepathy-farstream-0.4 patch?
[06:01] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, idk
[06:02] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, wait, it's included in your upload
[06:02] <Noskcaj> smartboyhw, I barely remember merging it
[06:02] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, who merged it?
[06:02] <Noskcaj> pitti
[06:02] <smartboyhw> Noskcaj, why does the changelog say it's you?
[06:02] <smartboyhw> And the patch is provided by Laney
[06:03] <Noskcaj> i mean, i merged it, pitti sponsored, and idk about laney
[06:03] <Noskcaj> i have to go
[06:03]  * smartboyhw checks logs, sigh
[06:07] <smartboyhw> Foundit
[06:07] <smartboyhw> Hmm
[07:20] <Riddell> smartboyhw: nope if that's added by debian I'd wonder what's what on there
[07:21] <smartboyhw> Riddell, it's added by Laney it seems
[07:21] <smartboyhw> But obviously I can now install it, keeping gstreamer-0.10 WITHOUT the patch
[08:04] <soee> good morning
[09:22] <vHanda> shadeslayer: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321139#c9
[09:22] <ubottu> KDE bug 321139 in filewatch "Polkit dialog not explicit enough when trying to raise filewatch limit" [Wishlist,Confirmed]
[09:22] <vHanda> The inotify limit isn't enough?
[09:25] <yofel> $ cat /etc/sysctl.d/30-nepomuk-inotify-limit.conf 
[09:25] <yofel> fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288
[09:25] <yofel> should be enough, shouldn't it?
[09:26] <vHanda> It should be. I'll ask them to provide the additional info
[09:26] <valorie> vHanda: I just sent a guy from #kde to #nepomuk-kde for help
[09:26] <vHanda> yeah. I just read that on #kde
[09:27] <valorie> cool
[09:30] <lordievader> Good morning.
=== smartboyhw changed the topic of #kubuntu-devel to: Kubuntu - Friendly Computing | https://trello.com/kubuntu | https://notes.kde.org/p/kubuntu-ninjas 4.11.0 saucy/archive raring/backports precise/ninjas| 13.10 Alpha 2 released | 13.10 milestoned bugs tagged Kubuntu http://goo.gl/vHRjj | Kubuntu 12.04.3 still NOT yet released
[09:31] <smartboyhw> Well, stupid Wubi ^
[09:32] <yofel> not only wubi, my LXC containers that I updated yesterday also say 12.04.3
[09:33] <yofel> releasing only counts for the images anyway
[09:33] <smartboyhw> yofel, no, I mean it's Wubi who's delaying the release:P
[09:33] <lordievader> My server also says 12.04.3.
[09:33] <yofel> oh that, who cares about wubi?
[09:33] <lordievader> But anyways all of the images are marked ready, so what else can we do but wait?
[09:33] <smartboyhw> They fix it in US evening, that the Release Team has to sleep
[09:33] <yofel> though in precise it actually still works I think
[09:34]  * smartboyhw never did a successful installation using Wubi
[09:34] <yofel> I did, I never saw the installer but it somehow installed successfully
[09:47] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: that's because ktp call ui doesn't support gstreamer 1.0 yet
[09:47] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: and farstream 1.0 only supports gstreamer 1.0
[09:47] <shadeslayer> farstream 0.4 supports gst 0.10 which is why we have that patch
[09:52] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, are you guys working on making it work?
[09:52] <shadeslayer> not me
[09:52] <shadeslayer> but I believe someone might be
[09:52] <shadeslayer> The idea was to first port qgst then ktp-call-ui
[09:53] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: either way, it's not like gst 0.10 is deprecated
[09:53] <shadeslayer> it still gets updates
[09:56] <smartboyhw> I got a KDE dev account now (due to that I'm working in a new project KCountries)
[09:56] <smartboyhw> KCountries = introducing people to different countries
[09:56] <smartboyhw> That's a wiki app:P
[09:56] <lordievader> smartboyhw: Nice, congratulations.
[10:13] <shadeslayer> :S
[10:13] <shadeslayer> Noskcaj dropped a vital patch
[10:14] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, well, there's a fix in my packaging-staging-2 ppa
[10:14] <smartboyhw> if you would upload it
[10:15] <shadeslayer> okay
[10:15] <shadeslayer> link to dsc?
[10:16] <smartboyhw> HELL, wait
[10:17] <smartboyhw> I added an extra .0:O

[10:20] <smartboyhw> Packaging staging 4;P
[10:20] <shadeslayer> @_@
[10:20] <shadeslayer> why don't you use PPA
[10:20] <shadeslayer> ~ppa1
[10:21] <smartboyhw> Because I would rather like them when that's used for ppa only
[10:22]  * smartboyhw rather wants to waste my time then reviewer time
[10:33] <BluesKaj> Howdy folks
[10:44] <ovidiu-florin> hello world
[10:44] <ovidiu-florin> does kubuntu use systemd? if not, will it?
[10:44] <smartboyhw> Now in Konversation!
[10:46] <shadeslayer> ovidiu-florin: uhm, we can't say
[10:47] <shadeslayer> ovidiu-florin: the need for systemd *might* arise when we switch to wayland
[10:47] <shadeslayer> and we will discuss it when the need arises :)
[10:50] <ovidiu-florin> if I may, if you would only discuss it if the need arises, then why not just stick with xorg, since wayland can be considered as not really necessary?
[10:51] <shadeslayer> how is it not really necessary o_o
[10:52] <ovidiu-florin> the same I could say about systemd
[10:52] <shadeslayer> how so?
[10:52] <yofel> not really, kwin will switch to wayland, so we know we have to look at it
[10:52] <shadeslayer> if wayland really needs it then we'll have to make it work?
[10:52] <shadeslayer> and what yofel said
[10:53] <ovidiu-florin> I didn't dissagree with that
[10:53] <yofel> so far I don't see that we will need systemd
[10:53] <yofel> upstart works fine and I don't see how kde requires systemd
[10:53] <ovidiu-florin> I just said that unless wayland needs it, you won't consider systemd?
[10:53] <yofel> we do use parts of systemd like logind already as that's used by kde
[10:54] <shadeslayer> ^^
[10:54] <yofel> systemd itself is so far not needed
[10:54] <yofel> it's not really an option currently anyway, as ubuntu only support upstart
[10:55] <yofel> *supports
[10:55] <ovidiu-florin> ok, I understand now
[10:58] <shadeslayer> moment, finding link
[10:59] <shadeslayer> https://dvdhrm.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/thoughts-on-linux-system-compositors/
[10:59] <shadeslayer> had a conversation with Martin a week or two ago and he gave me that link
[10:59] <shadeslayer> and said Wayland might need systemd / logind
[11:00] <shadeslayer> <quote> At the moment it doesn't matter, because the required components (wlsystemc) do not exist yet. </quote>
[11:00] <shadeslayer> so once wlsystemc gets implemented, we will know whether we need systemd , logind or both
[11:08] <yofel> "In fact, if logind becomes the central session manager, the concept of a system compositor will be dead and buried"
[11:08] <yofel> tell that MIR ^^
[11:10] <shadeslayer> :D
[11:14] <yofel> nice read, thanks
[11:15] <BluesKaj> I hear talk by arch users about systemd being so wonderful and fast boot times etc. It is fast, but after installing arch running it was anticlimactic , very stable and for some reason , boring . The attitude in their chatrooms was juvenile and silly, not conducive to learning more about the OS
[11:17] <yofel> did arch ever use upstart? In my experiements with systemd it was fast for sure, but not really any faster than upstart once you had a sufficient amount of services installed
[11:17] <shadeslayer> ^
[11:17] <ovidiu-florin> BluesKaj: that's the general attitude thowards anything in #archlinux
[11:18] <ovidiu-florin> I only go there as a last resort
[11:20] <BluesKaj> ovidiu-florin, it's unfortunate that their chats are dominated by smug, arrogant and childish members :(
[11:20] <ovidiu-florin> they are not all like that, but most of them are
[11:21] <ovidiu-florin> that's why I mostly hang out in #archlinux.ro
[11:21] <ovidiu-florin> local channel
[11:21] <BluesKaj> right
[11:27] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: your fix is wrong btw
[11:34] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer: oh?
[11:34] <shadeslayer> !find telepathy-glib/channel.h saucy
[11:34] <ubottu> File telepathy-glib/channel.h found in libtelepathy-glib-dev
[11:35] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: yes, we don't want to build with farstream 1.0
[11:35] <smartboyhw> mmm?
[11:35] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer: oh
[11:35] <shadeslayer> dafuq?
[11:35] <smartboyhw> !?
[11:36] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: think about how to fix it
[11:36] <shadeslayer> I have a workaround
[11:37] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer: What farstream version do you want then?
[11:37] <shadeslayer> libtelepathy-farstream-0.4-dev
[11:37] <smartboyhw> What?
[11:38] <smartboyhw> I thought the patch and the debian/control works
[11:38]  * smartboyhw doesn't understand
[11:38] <shadeslayer> it works, but it's wrong
[11:39] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: try fixing the problem without modifying the build depends
[11:39] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer: :O
[11:39]  * smartboyhw doesn't have time for this then, sorru
[11:39] <smartboyhw> &sorry
[11:48] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer: I just have a think of it, does that involve symlinks?
[11:48] <shadeslayer> no
[11:48] <smartboyhw> install files?
[11:48] <shadeslayer> no
[11:49] <shadeslayer> stop guessing :P
[11:49] <shadeslayer> look at the diff :)
[11:49] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer: LOL
[11:50] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer: eh, where is it?
[11:50]  * smartboyhw still sees -1ubuntu1 in Launchpad
[11:50] <shadeslayer> I didn't upload it
[11:50] <shadeslayer> still playing with the package

[12:42] <shadeslayer> I moved  "${DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS[@]}" to the top ( it was at the bottom )
[12:42] <shadeslayer> and it worked -.-
[12:42] <smartboyhw> HEH
[12:42] <yofel> ah, it's probably setting the wrong keyring in there ^^
[12:42] <shadeslayer> probably
[12:43] <yofel> forget probably, /usr/share/pbuilder/pbuilderrc line 91
[12:45] <shadeslayer> -.-
[12:45] <smartboyhw> yofel: shadeslayer: So, looking at the Tanglu wiki, you only got 3 people working?:O
[12:45] <shadeslayer> yeah
[12:45] <shadeslayer> and I don't work
[12:45] <shadeslayer> haven't done anything lately
[12:46] <yofel> make that 1.5, ximion is 1, shadeslayer is 0.2, I am 0.3
[12:46] <shadeslayer> :P
[12:46] <smartboyhw> Uh
[12:46] <yofel> well, add +0.1 for dantti
[12:46] <shadeslayer> I have no fricking idea why live build isn't working
[12:46] <shadeslayer> okay well, I might, but I have no idea how to fix it
[12:46]  * smartboyhw is amazed that you can make contributor amounts down to 0.1 when there's 4 people:O
[12:47] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer: What's the prob?

[15:57] <blaze> how to reproduce: 1) run "akonadictl stop" 2) run "designer-qt4" 3) find akonadi among the running processes
[16:07] <seaLne> does anyone happen to know is there a way to deactivate my ubuntu.com/kubuntu.org address, it makes it hard for me to properly handle spam
[16:08] <seaLne> i can't see anything obvious in launchpad
[16:18] <ScottK> seaLne: I'd ask on #launchpad.
[16:19] <seaLne> not sure if you are supposed to be able to do it through launchpad or some other way
